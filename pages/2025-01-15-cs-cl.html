<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun-Peng Ning, Jia-Yu Yao, Yu-Yang Liu, Mu-Nan Ning, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, are considered to learn the latent distributions within large-scale web-crawl datasets and accomplish natural language processing (NLP) tasks by predicting the next token. However, this mechanism of latent distribution modeling lacks quantitative understanding and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that any language dataset can be represented by a Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``Data-Tree''), where each node denotes a token, each edge denotes a token transition probability, and each sequence has a unique path. Any GPT-like language model can also be flattened into another Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``GPT-Tree''). Our experiments show that different GPT models trained on the same dataset exhibit significant structural similarity in GPT-Tree visualization, and larger models converge more closely to the Data-Tree. More than 87\% GPT output tokens can be recalled by Data-Tree. These findings may confirm that the reasoning process of LLMs is more likely to be probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning, as each model inference seems to find a context pattern with maximum probability from the Data-Tree. Furthermore, we provide deeper insights into issues such as hallucination, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and token bias in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karishma Thakrar, Nick Young</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) to extract nuanced and complex job features from unstructured job postings. Using a dataset of 1.2 million job postings provided by AdeptID, we developed a robust pipeline to identify and classify variables such as remote work availability, remuneration structures, educational requirements, and work experience preferences. Our methodology combines semantic chunking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning DistilBERT models to overcome the limitations of traditional parsing tools. By leveraging these techniques, we achieved significant improvements in identifying variables often mislabeled or overlooked, such as non-salary-based compensation and inferred remote work categories. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our fine-tuned models and analyze their strengths, limitations, and potential for scaling. This work highlights the promise of LLMs in labor market analytics, providing a foundation for more accurate and actionable insights into job data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a dataset of high-quality human-authored summaries of news articles in Norwegian. The dataset is intended for benchmarking the abstractive summarisation capabilities of generative language models. Each document in the dataset is provided with three different candidate gold-standard summaries written by native Norwegian speakers, and all summaries are provided in both of the written variants of Norwegian -- Bokm{\aa}l and Nynorsk. The paper describes details on the data creation effort as well as an evaluation of existing open LLMs for Norwegian on the dataset. We also provide insights from a manual human evaluation, comparing human-authored to model-generated summaries. Our results indicate that the dataset provides a challenging LLM benchmark for Norwegian summarisation capabilities</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Havaldar, Hamidreza Alvari, Alex Fabrikant, John Palowitch, Mohammad Javad Hosseini, Senaka Buthpitiya</p>
<p>Abstract: Much of human communication depends on implication, conveying meaning beyond literal words to express a wider range of thoughts, intentions, and feelings. For models to better understand and facilitate human communication, they must be responsive to the text's implicit meaning. We focus on Natural Language Inference (NLI), a core tool for many language tasks, and find that state-of-the-art NLI models and datasets struggle to recognize a range of cases where entailment is implied, rather than explicit from the text. We formalize implied entailment as an extension of the NLI task and introduce the Implied NLI dataset (INLI) to help today's LLMs both recognize a broader variety of implied entailments and to distinguish between implicit and explicit entailment. We show how LLMs fine-tuned on INLI understand implied entailment and can generalize this understanding across datasets and domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vlad-Andrei B\u{a}doiu, Mihai-Valentin Dumitru, Alexandru M. Gherghescu, Alexandru Agache, Costin Raiciu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks with commercial models leading the way. While open models usually operate at a smaller scale, they maintain competitiveness through specialization and fine-tuning. However, a significant challenge persists: open models often underperform in low-resource languages due to limited representation in the training corpus. In this paper, we present LLMic, a bilingual foundation language model designed specifically for the Romanian Language. We document the complete process of pretraining a foundation model for a low-resource language, including corpus construction, architecture selection, and hyper-parameter optimization. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLMic can be specialized for tasks in the target language, achieving results comparable to other much larger open models. We show that fine-tuning LLMic for language translation after the initial pretraining phase outperforms existing solutions in English-to-Romanian translation tasks. This opens the path for efficient large-scale processing for the Romanian language community, using the much smaller LLMic model</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmenting text into Elemental Discourse Units (EDUs) is a fundamental task in discourse parsing. We present a new simple method for identifying EDU boundaries, and hence segmenting them, based on lexical and character n-gram features, using random forest classification. We show that the method, despite its simplicity, outperforms other methods both for segmentation and within a state of the art discourse parser. This indicates the importance of such features for identifying basic discourse elements, pointing towards potentially more training-efficient methods for discourse analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Ferenc \v{S}egedin, Gasper Begu\v{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability work on the convolutional layers of CNNs has primarily focused on computer vision, but some studies also explore correspondences between the latent space and the output in the audio domain. However, it has not been thoroughly examined how acoustic and linguistic information is represented in the fully connected (FC) layer that bridges the latent space and convolutional layers. The current study presents the first exploration of how the FC layer of CNNs for speech synthesis encodes linguistically relevant information. We propose two techniques for exploration of the fully connected layer. In Experiment 1, we use weight matrices as inputs into convolutional layers. In Experiment 2, we manipulate the FC layer to explore how symbolic-like representations are encoded in CNNs. We leverage the fact that the FC layer outputs a feature map and that variable-specific weight matrices are temporally structured to (1) demonstrate how the distribution of learned weights varies between latent variables in systematic ways and (2) demonstrate how manipulating the FC layer while holding constant subsequent model parameters affects the output. We ultimately present an FC manipulation that can output a single segment. Using this technique, we show that lexically specific latent codes in generative CNNs (ciwGAN) have shared lexically invariant sublexical representations in the FC-layer weights, showing that ciwGAN encodes lexical information in a linguistically principled manner.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study underscores the pivotal role of syntax feedback in augmenting the syntactic proficiency of students. Recognizing the challenges faced by learners in mastering syntactic nuances, we introduce a specialized dataset named Essay-Syntax-Instruct designed to enhance the understanding and application of English syntax among these students. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3.5-Turbo, Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, Llama-2-13b-chat-hf, and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, this work embarks on a comprehensive fine-tuning process tailored to the syntax improvement task. Through meticulous evaluation, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLMs exhibit a marked improvement in addressing syntax-related challenges, thereby serving as a potent tool for students to identify and rectify their syntactic errors. The findings not only highlight the effectiveness of the proposed dataset in elevating the performance of LLMs for syntax enhancement but also illuminate a promising path for utilizing advanced language models to support language acquisition efforts. This research contributes to the broader field of language learning technology by showcasing the potential of LLMs in facilitating the linguistic development of Students.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07766">Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Embedding Techniques, Methods, and Challenges: A Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Liu, Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted a lot of attention in various fields due to their superior performance, aiming to train hundreds of millions or more parameters on large amounts of text data to understand and generate natural language. As the superior performance of LLMs becomes apparent, they are increasingly being applied to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) related tasks to improve the processing results. As a deep learning model in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it learns a large amount of textual data to predict the next word or generate content related to a given text. However, LLMs have recently been invoked to varying degrees in different types of KGE related scenarios such as multi-modal KGE and open KGE according to their task characteristics. In this paper, we investigate a wide range of approaches for performing LLMs-related tasks in different types of KGE scenarios. To better compare the various approaches, we summarize each KGE scenario in a classification. In addition to the categorization methods, we provide a tabular overview of the methods and their source code links for a more direct comparison. In the article we also discuss the applications in which the methods are mainly used and suggest several forward-looking directions for the development of this new research area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh D. Dhole</p>
<p>Abstract: Among parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, freezing has emerged as a popular strategy for speeding up training, reducing catastrophic forgetting, and improving downstream performance. We investigate the impact of freezing the decoder in a multi-task setup comprising diverse natural language tasks, aiming to reduce deployment overhead and enhance portability to novel tasks. Our experiments, conducted by fine-tuning both individual and multi-task setups on the AlexaTM model, reveal that freezing decoders is highly effective for tasks with natural language outputs and mitigates catastrophic forgetting in multilingual tasks. However, we find that pairing frozen decoders with a larger model can effectively maintain or even enhance performance in structured and QA tasks, making it a viable strategy for a broader range of task types.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07824">Real-time Verification and Refinement of Language Model Text Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonho Ko, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Han, Yaochen Xie, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Sreyashi Nag, William Headden, Hui Liu, Yang Li, Chen Luo, Shuiwang Ji, Qi He, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of tasks; however, they still encounter challenges in reasoning tasks that require understanding and inferring relationships between distinct pieces of information within text sequences. This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial. Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks. However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided. Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning? In this paper, we propose Reasoning with Graphs (RwG) by first constructing explicit graphs from the context and then leveraging these graphs to enhance LLM reasoning performance on reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the fine-tuning (FT) of the Open Pre-trained Transformer (OPT-125M) for grammatical acceptability tasks using the CoLA dataset. By comparing Vanilla-Fine-Tuning (VFT), Pattern-Based-Fine-Tuning (PBFT), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques (PEFT) like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments reveal that while VFT achieves the highest accuracy (81.2%), LoRA enhancing FT by reducing memory usage and iteration time by more than 50%, and increases accuracy in PBFT case. Context Distillation (CD), though computationally efficient, underperformed with accuracy around 31%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongxiang Sun, Qipeng Wang, Weijie Yu, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Song Yang, Han Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in knowledge-intensive tasks but face limitations in complex multi-step reasoning. While recent methods have integrated RAG with chain-of-thought reasoning or test-time search using Process Reward Models (PRMs), these approaches encounter challenges such as a lack of explanations, bias in PRM training data, early-step bias in PRM scores, and insufficient post-training optimization of reasoning potential. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning through Trustworthy Process Rewarding (ReARTeR), a framework that enhances RAG systems' reasoning capabilities through post-training and test-time scaling. At test time, ReARTeR introduces Trustworthy Process Rewarding via a Process Reward Model for accurate scalar scoring and a Process Explanation Model (PEM) for generating natural language explanations, enabling step refinement. During post-training, it utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by Trustworthy Process Rewarding to collect high-quality step-level preference data, optimized through Iterative Preference Optimization. ReARTeR addresses three core challenges: (1) misalignment between PRM and PEM, tackled through off-policy preference learning; (2) bias in PRM training data, mitigated by balanced annotation methods and stronger annotations for challenging examples; and (3) early-step bias in PRM, resolved through a temporal-difference-based look-ahead search strategy. Experimental results on multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements, underscoring ReARTeR's potential to advance the reasoning capabilities of RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chin Yuen Kwok, Jia Qi Yip, Eng Siong Chng</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Multilingual ASR models only support a fraction of the world's languages. Continual Learning (CL) aims to tackle this problem by adding new languages to pre-trained models while avoiding the loss of performance on existing languages, also known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, existing CL methods overlook the adaptation of the token embedding lookup table at the decoder, despite its significant contribution to CF. We propose Embedding Layer Surgery where separate copies of the token embeddings are created for each new languages, and one of the copies is selected to replace the old languages embeddings when transcribing the corresponding new language. Unfortunately, this approach means LID errors also cause incorrect ASR embedding selection. Our Task-wise Beam Search allows self-correction for such mistakes. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of data for each of 10 unseen languages from Common Voice, results show that our method reduces the Average WER (AWER) of pre-trained languages from 14.2% to 11.9% compared with Experience Replay, without compromising the AWER of the unseen languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks benefit from utilizing multiple smaller expert models as opposed to a single large network. However, these experts typically operate independently, leaving a question open about whether interconnecting these models could enhance the performance of MoE networks. In response, we introduce GRAPHMOE, a novel method aimed at augmenting the cognitive depth of language models via a self-rethinking mechanism constructed on Pseudo GraphMoE networks. GRAPHMOE employs a recurrent routing strategy to simulate iterative thinking steps, thereby facilitating the flow of information among expert nodes. We implement the GRAPHMOE architecture using Low-Rank Adaptation techniques (LoRA) and conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. The experimental results reveal that GRAPHMOE outperforms other LoRA based models, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, this study explores a novel recurrent routing strategy that may inspire further advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialogue is at the core of human behaviour and being able to identify the topic at hand is crucial to take part in conversation. Yet, there are few accounts of the topical organisation in casual dialogue and of how people recognise the current topic in the literature. Moreover, analysing topics in dialogue requires conversations long enough to contain several topics and types of topic shifts. Such data is complicated to collect and annotate. In this paper we present a dialogue collection experiment which aims to build a corpus suitable for topical analysis. We will carry out the collection with a messaging tool we developed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diversity is an important property of datasets and sampling data for diversity is useful in dataset creation. Finding the optimally diverse sample is expensive, we therefore present a heuristic significantly increasing diversity relative to random sampling. We also explore whether different kinds of diversity -- lexical and syntactic -- correlate, with the purpose of sampling for expensive syntactic diversity through inexpensive lexical diversity. We find that correlations fluctuate with different datasets and versions of diversity measures. This shows that an arbitrarily chosen measure may fall short of capturing diversity-related properties of datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is pivotal for achieving optimal performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, while full fine-tuning delivers superior results, it entails significant computational and resource costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, address these challenges by reducing the number of trainable parameters, but they often struggle with rank adjustment efficiency and task-specific adaptability. We propose Triangular Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (TriAdaptLoRA), a novel PEFT framework inspired by neuroscience principles, which dynamically optimizes the allocation of trainable parameters. TriAdaptLoRA introduces three key innovations: 1) a triangular split of transformation matrices into lower and upper triangular components to maximize parameter utilization, 2) a parameter importance metric based on normalized Frobenius norms for efficient adaptation, and 3) an adaptive rank-growth strategy governed by dynamic thresholds, allowing flexible parameter allocation across training steps. Experiments conducted on a variety of natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that TriAdaptLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods. It achieves superior performance, enhanced stability, and reduced computational overhead, particularly under linear threshold-driven rank growth. These results highlight its efficacy as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Sharma, Shanu Kumar, Avinash Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have shown massive gains across many text classification tasks. However, these models usually need enormous labeled data to achieve impressive performances. Obtaining labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming, whereas collecting unlabeled data using some heuristics is relatively much cheaper for any task. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that encapsulates reinforcement learning-based text generation and semi-supervised adversarial learning approaches in a novel way to improve the model's performance. Our method READ, Reinforcement-based Adversarial learning, utilizes an unlabeled dataset to generate diverse synthetic text through reinforcement learning, improving the model's generalization capability using adversarial learning. Our experimental results show that READ outperforms the existing state-of-art methods on multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Awritrojit Banerjee, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the internal mechanisms of BERT, a transformer-based large language model, with a focus on its ability to cluster narrative content and authorial style across its layers. Using a dataset of narratives developed via GPT-4, featuring diverse semantic content and stylistic variations, we analyze BERT's layerwise activations to uncover patterns of localized neural processing. Through dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), we reveal that BERT exhibits strong clustering based on narrative content in its later layers, with progressively compact and distinct clusters. While strong stylistic clustering might occur when narratives are rephrased into different text types (e.g., fables, sci-fi, kids' stories), minimal clustering is observed for authorial style specific to individual writers. These findings highlight BERT's prioritization of semantic content over stylistic features, offering insights into its representational capabilities and processing hierarchy. This study contributes to understanding how transformer models like BERT encode linguistic information, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Lee, Singh Suniljit, Yong Siang Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the development of a multimodal sentiment analysis model that integrates text, audio, and visual data to enhance sentiment classification. The goal is to improve emotion detection by capturing the complex interactions between these modalities, thereby enabling more accurate and nuanced sentiment interpretation. The study evaluates three feature fusion strategies -- late stage fusion, early stage fusion, and multi-headed attention -- within a transformer-based architecture. Experiments were conducted using the CMU-MOSEI dataset, which includes synchronized text, audio, and visual inputs labeled with sentiment scores. Results show that early stage fusion significantly outperforms late stage fusion, achieving an accuracy of 71.87\%, while the multi-headed attention approach offers marginal improvement, reaching 72.39\%. The findings suggest that integrating modalities early in the process enhances sentiment classification, while attention mechanisms may have limited impact within the current framework. Future work will focus on refining feature fusion techniques, incorporating temporal data, and exploring dynamic feature weighting to further improve model performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08102">Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language Models on Social Media</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlu Fan, Yuqi Zhu, Chenyang Wang, Bin Wang, Wentao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Refusal behavior in large language models (LLMs) enables them to decline responding to harmful, unethical, or inappropriate prompts, ensuring alignment with ethical standards. This paper investigates refusal behavior across six LLMs from three architectural families. We challenge the assumption of refusal as a linear phenomenon by employing dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. Our results reveal that refusal mechanisms exhibit nonlinear, multidimensional characteristics that vary by model architecture and layer. These findings highlight the need for nonlinear interpretability to improve alignment research and inform safer AI deployment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rewina Bedemariam, Natalie Perez, Sreyoshi Bhaduri, Satya Kapoor, Alex Gil, Elizabeth Conjar, Ikkei Itoku, David Theil, Aman Chadha, Naumaan Nayyar</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data. This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Fang, Xinle Deng, Kangwei Liu, Ningyu Zhang, Jingyang Qian, Penghui Yang, Xiaohui Fan, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their success heavily relies on the quality of pretraining corpora. For Chinese LLMs, the scarcity of high-quality Chinese datasets presents a significant challenge, often limiting their performance. To address this issue, we propose the OpenCSG Chinese Corpus, a series of high-quality datasets specifically designed for LLM pretraining, post-training, and fine-tuning. This corpus includes Fineweb-edu-chinese, Fineweb-edu-chinese-v2, Cosmopedia-chinese, and Smoltalk-chinese, each with distinct characteristics: Fineweb-edu datasets focus on filtered, high-quality content derived from diverse Chinese web sources; Cosmopedia-chinese provides synthetic, textbook-style data for knowledge-intensive training; and Smoltalk-chinese emphasizes stylistic and diverse chat-format data. The OpenCSG Chinese Corpus is characterized by its high-quality text, diverse coverage across domains, and scalable, reproducible data curation processes. Additionally, we conducted extensive experimental analyses, including evaluations on smaller parameter models, which demonstrated significant performance improvements in tasks such as C-Eval, showcasing the effectiveness of the corpus for training Chinese LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in math problem-solving tasks, their robustness to noisy inputs is not well-studied. In this work, we propose ArithmAttack to examine how robust the LLMs are when they encounter noisy prompts that contain extra noise in the form of punctuation marks. While being easy to implement, ArithmAttack does not cause any information loss since words are not added or deleted from the context. We evaluate the robustness of seven LLMs, including LLama3, Mistral, and Mathstral, on noisy GSM8K and MultiArith datasets. Our experiments suggest that all the studied models show vulnerability to such noise, with more noise leading to poorer performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohita Chowdhury, Yajie Vera He, Aisling Higham, Ernest Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08248">Eliciting In-context Retrieval and Reasoning for Long-context Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Qiu, Varun Embar, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly, Shay B. Cohen, Benjamin Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in long-context language models (LCLMs) promise to transform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by simplifying pipelines. With their expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases and perform retrieval and reasoning directly -- a capability we define as In-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks like LOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplified contexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMs in more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved with strong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance: (1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, which uses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and (3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluation of five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains with our best approach applied to Mistral-7B: +17 and +15 points by Exact Match on LOFT, and +13 and +2 points on ICR^2, compared to vanilla RAG and supervised fine-tuning, respectively. It even outperforms GPT-4-Turbo on most tasks despite being a much smaller model.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate the efficacy of various adapter architectures on supervised binary classification tasks from the SuperGLUE benchmark as well as a supervised multi-class news category classification task from Kaggle. Specifically, we compare classification performance and time complexity of three transformer models, namely DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and BART, using conventional fine-tuning as well as nine state-of-the-art (SoTA) adapter architectures. Our analysis reveals performance differences across adapter architectures, highlighting their ability to achieve comparable or better performance relative to fine-tuning at a fraction of the training time. Similar results are observed on the new classification task, further supporting our findings and demonstrating adapters as efficient and flexible alternatives to fine-tuning. This study provides valuable insights and guidelines for selecting and implementing adapters in diverse natural language processing (NLP) applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pulkit Arora, Akbar Karimi, Lucie Flek</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks. However, there are concerns about their reliability in different domains of linguistic variations. Many works have proposed robustness evaluation measures for local adversarial attacks, but we need globally robust models unbiased to different language styles. We take a broader approach to explore a wider range of variations across sociodemographic dimensions to perform structured reliability tests on the reasoning capacity of language models. We extend the SocialIQA dataset to create diverse paraphrased sets conditioned on sociodemographic styles. The assessment aims to provide a deeper understanding of LLMs in (a) their capability of generating demographic paraphrases with engineered prompts and (b) their reasoning capabilities in real-world, complex language scenarios. We also explore measures such as perplexity, explainability, and ATOMIC performance of paraphrases for fine-grained reliability analysis of LLMs on these sets. We find that demographic-specific paraphrasing significantly impacts the performance of language models, indicating that the subtleties of language variations remain a significant challenge. The code and dataset will be made available for reproducibility and future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hate speech and abusive language are global phenomena that need socio-cultural background knowledge to be understood, identified, and moderated. However, in many regions of the Global South, there have been several documented occurrences of (1) absence of moderation and (2) censorship due to the reliance on keyword spotting out of context. Further, high-profile individuals have frequently been at the center of the moderation process, while large and targeted hate speech campaigns against minorities have been overlooked. These limitations are mainly due to the lack of high-quality data in the local languages and the failure to include local communities in the collection, annotation, and moderation processes. To address this issue, we present AfriHate: a multilingual collection of hate speech and abusive language datasets in 15 African languages. Each instance in AfriHate is annotated by native speakers familiar with the local culture. We report the challenges related to the construction of the datasets and present various classification baseline results with and without using LLMs. The datasets, individual annotations, and hate speech and offensive language lexicons are available on https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhilasha Ravichander, Shrusti Ghela, David Wadden, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive ability to generate high-quality and fluent text, generative large language models (LLMs) also produce hallucinations: statements that are misaligned with established world knowledge or provided input context. However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors). We hope our framework provides a foundation to enable the principled study of why generative models hallucinate, and advances the development of trustworthy large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliance on anonymity in social media has increased its popularity on these platforms among all ages. The availability of public Wi-Fi networks has facilitated a vast variety of online content, including social media applications. Although anonymity and ease of access can be a convenient means of communication for their users, it is difficult to manage and protect its vulnerable users against sexual predators. Using an automated identification system that can attribute predators to their text would make the solution more attainable. In this survey, we provide a review of the methods of pedophile attribution used in social media platforms. We examine the effect of the size of the suspect set and the length of the text on the task of attribution. Moreover, we review the most-used datasets, features, classification techniques and performance measures for attributing sexual predators. We found that few studies have proposed tools to mitigate the risk of online sexual predators, but none of them can provide suspect attribution. Finally, we list several open research problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Al\v{z}b\v{e}ta Ku\v{c}erov\'a, Johann-Mattis List</p>
<p>Abstract: Object naming - the act of identifying an object with a word or a phrase - is a fundamental skill in interpersonal communication, relevant to many disciplines, such as psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics, or language and vision research. Object naming datasets, which consist of concept lists with picture pairings, are used to gain insights into how humans access and select names for objects in their surroundings and to study the cognitive processes involved in converting visual stimuli into semantic concepts. Unfortunately, object naming datasets often lack transparency and have a highly idiosyncratic structure. Our study tries to make current object naming data transparent and comparable by using a multilingual, computer-assisted approach that links individual items of object naming lists to unified concepts. Our current sample links 17 object naming datasets that cover 30 languages from 10 different language families. We illustrate how the comparative dataset can be explored by searching for concepts that recur across the majority of datasets and comparing the conceptual spaces of covered object naming datasets with classical basic vocabulary lists from historical linguistics and linguistic typology. Our findings can serve as a basis for enhancing cross-linguistic object naming research and as a guideline for future studies dealing with object naming tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01, which are comparable to top-tier models while offering superior capabilities in processing longer contexts. The core lies in lightning attention and its efficient scaling. To maximize computational capacity, we integrate it with Mixture of Experts (MoE), creating a model with 32 experts and 456 billion total parameters, of which 45.9 billion are activated for each token. We develop an optimized parallel strategy and highly efficient computation-communication overlap techniques for MoE and lightning attention. This approach enables us to conduct efficient training and inference on models with hundreds of billions of parameters across contexts spanning millions of tokens. The context window of MiniMax-Text-01 can reach up to 1 million tokens during training and extrapolate to 4 million tokens during inference at an affordable cost. Our vision-language model, MiniMax-VL-01 is built through continued training with 512 billion vision-language tokens. Experiments on both standard and in-house benchmarks show that our models match the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering 20-32 times longer context window. We publicly release MiniMax-01 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoav Gur-Arieh, Roy Mayan, Chen Agassy, Atticus Geiger, Mor Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated interpretability pipelines generate natural language descriptions for the concepts represented by features in large language models (LLMs), such as plants or the first word in a sentence. These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokens weighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens after applying the vocabulary "unembedding" head directly to the feature. Our output-centric descriptions better capture the causal effect of a feature on model outputs than input-centric descriptions, but combining the two leads to the best performance on both input and output evaluations. Lastly, we show that output-centric descriptions can be used to find inputs that activate features previously thought to be "dead".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Aliakbarzadeh, Lucie Flek, Akbar Karimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on Web data that might contain spelling errors made by humans. But do they become robust to similar real-world noise? In this paper, we investigate the effect of real-world spelling mistakes on the performance of 9 language models, with parameters ranging from 0.2B to 13B, in 3 different NLP tasks, namely Natural Language Inference (NLI), Name Entity Recognition (NER), and Intent Classification (IC). We perform our experiments on 6 different languages and build a dictionary of real-world noise for them using the Wikipedia edit history. We show that the performance gap of the studied models on the clean and noisy test data averaged across all the datasets and languages ranges from 2.3 to 4.3 absolute percentage points. In addition, mT5 models, in general, show more robustness compared to BLOOM, Falcon, and BERT-like models. In particular, mT5 (13B), was the most robust on average overall, across the 3 tasks, and in 4 of the 6 languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Zhuang, Akshat Gupta, Richard Yang, Aniket Rahane, Zhengyu Li, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheqi Lv, Keming Ye, Zishu Wei, Qi Tian, Shengyu Zhang, Wenqiao Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Kun Kuang, Tat-Seng Chua, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have become foundational to advancements in multiple domains, including recommendation systems, natural language processing, and so on. Despite their successes, these models often contain incompatible parameters that can be underutilized or detrimental to model performance, particularly when faced with specific, varying data distributions. Existing research excels in removing such parameters or merging the outputs of multiple different pretrained models. However, the former focuses on efficiency rather than performance, while the latter requires several times more computing and storage resources to support inference. In this paper, we set the goal to explicitly improve these incompatible parameters by leveraging the complementary strengths of different models, thereby directly enhancing the models without any additional parameters. Specifically, we propose Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration (CKI), which consists of Parameter Compatibility Assessment and Parameter Splicing, which are used to evaluate the knowledge content of multiple models and integrate the knowledge into one model, respectively. The integrated model can be used directly for inference or for further fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets for recommendation and language tasks, and the results show that Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration can effectively optimize incompatible parameters under multiple tasks and settings to break through the training limit of the original model without increasing the inference cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Jyoti Bajpai, Manjesh Kumar Hanawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have grown increasingly large in size to achieve state of the art performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their high computational requirements make them less suitable for resource-constrained applications. Also, real-world datasets often consist of a mixture of easy and complex samples, necessitating adaptive inference mechanisms that account for sample difficulty. Early exit strategies offer a promising solution by enabling adaptive inference, where simpler samples are classified using the initial layers of the DNN, thereby accelerating the overall inference process. By attaching classifiers at different layers, early exit methods not only reduce inference latency but also improve the model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of early exit methods and their applications in NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sree Bhattacharyya, Shuhua Yang, James Z. Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has provided unprecedented access to massive amounts of multimodal user-generated content. Comprehending user emotions can provide valuable insights for improving communication and understanding of human behaviors. Despite significant advancements in Affective Computing, the diverse factors influencing user emotions in social networks remain relatively understudied. Moreover, there is a notable lack of deep learning-based methods for predicting user emotions in social networks, which could be addressed by leveraging the extensive multimodal data available. This work presents a novel formulation of personalized emotion prediction in social networks based on heterogeneous graph learning. Building upon this formulation, we design HMG-Emo, a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework that utilizes deep learning-based features for user emotion recognition. Additionally, we include a dynamic context fusion module in HMG-Emo that is capable of adaptively integrating the different modalities in social media data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMG-Emo and verify the superiority of adopting a graph neural network-based approach, which outperforms existing baselines that use rich hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, HMG-Emo is the first multimodal and deep-learning-based approach to predict personalized emotions within online social networks. Our work highlights the significance of exploiting advanced deep learning techniques for less-explored problems in Affective Computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaokai Wang, Xizhou Zhu, Xue Yang, Gen Luo, Hao Li, Changyao Tian, Wenhan Dou, Junqi Ge, Lewei Lu, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Image pyramids are widely adopted in top-performing methods to obtain multi-scale features for precise visual perception and understanding. However, current image pyramids use the same large-scale model to process multiple resolutions of images, leading to significant computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture, called Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). Specifically, PIIP uses pretrained models (ViTs or CNNs) as branches to process multi-scale images, where images of higher resolutions are processed by smaller network branches to balance computational cost and performance. To integrate information from different spatial scales, we further propose a novel cross-branch feature interaction mechanism. To validate PIIP, we apply it to various perception models and a representative multimodal large language model called LLaVA, and conduct extensive experiments on various tasks such as object detection, segmentation, image classification and multimodal understanding. PIIP achieves superior performance compared to single-branch and existing multi-resolution approaches with lower computational cost. When applied to InternViT-6B, a large-scale vision foundation model, PIIP can improve its performance by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the original computation, finally achieving 60.0 box AP on MS COCO and 59.7 mIoU on ADE20K. For multimodal understanding, our PIIP-LLaVA achieves 73.0% accuracy on TextVQA and 74.5% on MMBench with only 2.8M training data. Our code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PIIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feijie Wu, Zitao Li, Fei Wei, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs), an agent can utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to integrate external knowledge and increase the reliability of its responses. Current RAG-based agents integrate single, domain-specific knowledge sources, limiting their ability and leading to hallucinated or inaccurate responses when addressing cross-domain queries. Integrating multiple knowledge bases into a unified RAG-based agent raises significant challenges, including increased retrieval overhead and data sovereignty when sensitive data is involved. In this work, we propose RopMura, a novel multi-agent system that addresses these limitations by incorporating highly efficient routing and planning mechanisms. RopMura features two key components: a router that intelligently selects the most relevant agents based on knowledge boundaries and a planner that decomposes complex multi-hop queries into manageable steps, allowing for coordinating cross-domain responses. Experimental results demonstrate that RopMura effectively handles both single-hop and multi-hop queries, with the routing mechanism enabling precise answers for single-hop queries and the combined routing and planning mechanisms achieving accurate, multi-step resolutions for complex queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Dhamani, Mary Lou Maher</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in prompting techniques and multi-agent systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) have produced increasingly complex approaches. However, we lack a framework for characterizing and comparing prompting techniques or understanding their relationship to multi-agent LLM systems. This position paper introduces and explains the concepts of linear contexts (a single, continuous sequence of interactions) and non-linear contexts (branching or multi-path) in LLM systems. These concepts enable the development of an agent-centric projection of prompting techniques, a framework that can reveal deep connections between prompting strategies and multi-agent systems. We propose three conjectures based on this framework: (1) results from non-linear prompting techniques can predict outcomes in equivalent multi-agent systems, (2) multi-agent system architectures can be replicated through single-LLM prompting techniques that simulate equivalent interaction patterns, and (3) these equivalences suggest novel approaches for generating synthetic training data. We argue that this perspective enables systematic cross-pollination of research findings between prompting and multi-agent domains, while providing new directions for improving both the design and training of future LLM systems.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07886">Iterative Label Refinement Matters More than Preference Optimization under Weak Supervision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowen Ye, Cassidy Laidlaw, Jacob Steinhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) post-training relies on two stages of human supervision: task demonstrations for supervised finetuning (SFT), followed by preference comparisons for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). As LMs become more capable, the tasks they are given become harder to supervise. Will post-training remain effective under unreliable supervision? To test this, we simulate unreliable demonstrations and comparison feedback using small LMs and time-constrained humans. We find that in the presence of unreliable supervision, SFT still retains some effectiveness, but DPO (a common RLHF algorithm) fails to improve the model beyond SFT. To address this, we propose iterative label refinement (ILR) as an alternative to RLHF. ILR improves the SFT data by using comparison feedback to decide whether human demonstrations should be replaced by model-generated alternatives, then retrains the model via SFT on the updated data. SFT+ILR outperforms SFT+DPO on several tasks with unreliable supervision (math, coding, and safe instruction-following). Our findings suggest that as LMs are used for complex tasks where human supervision is unreliable, RLHF may no longer be the best use of human comparison feedback; instead, it is better to direct feedback towards improving the training data rather than continually training the model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aziida Nanyonga, Hassan Wasswa, Ugur Turhan, Keith Joiner, Graham Wild</p>
<p>Abstract: Aviation safety is a global concern, requiring detailed investigations into incidents to understand contributing factors comprehensively. This study uses the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dataset. It applies advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and K-means clustering. The main objectives are identifying latent themes, exploring semantic relationships, assessing probabilistic connections, and cluster incidents based on shared characteristics. This research contributes to aviation safety by providing insights into incident narratives and demonstrating the versatility of NLP and topic modelling techniques in extracting valuable information from complex datasets. The results, including topics identified from various techniques, provide an understanding of recurring themes. Comparative analysis reveals that LDA performed best with a coherence value of 0.597, pLSA of 0.583, LSA of 0.542, and NMF of 0.437. K-means clustering further reveals commonalities and unique insights into incident narratives. In conclusion, this study uncovers latent patterns and thematic structures within incident narratives, offering a comparative analysis of multiple-topic modelling techniques. Future research avenues include exploring temporal patterns, incorporating additional datasets, and developing predictive models for early identification of safety issues. This research lays the groundwork for enhancing the understanding and improvement of aviation safety by utilising the wealth of information embedded in incident narratives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and rigorously expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack datasets. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.

<p>Abstract: The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from symbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern recognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible relationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin to measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic selection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring consistency and the invocation of general principles. We present Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph reasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. Inspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a structured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and ultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and adaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as discovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with materials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that integrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections. Results with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general autonomous reasoning solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly aided developers by generating or assisting in code writing, enhancing productivity across various tasks. While identifying incorrect code is often straightforward, detecting vulnerabilities in functionally correct code is more challenging, especially for developers with limited security knowledge, which poses considerable security risks of using LLM-generated code and underscores the need for robust evaluation benchmarks that assess both functional correctness and security. Current benchmarks like CyberSecEval and SecurityEval attempt to solve it but are hindered by unclear and impractical specifications, failing to assess both functionality and security accurately. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce CWEval, a novel outcome-driven evaluation framework designed to enhance the evaluation of secure code generation by LLMs. This framework not only assesses code functionality but also its security simultaneously with high-quality task specifications and outcome-driven test oracles which provides high accuracy. Coupled with CWEval-bench, a multilingual, security-critical coding benchmark, CWEval provides a rigorous empirical security evaluation on LLM-generated code, overcoming previous benchmarks' shortcomings. Through our evaluations, CWEval reveals a notable portion of functional but insecure code produced by LLMs, and shows a serious inaccuracy of previous evaluations, ultimately contributing significantly to the field of secure code generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Haiwen Li, Zhicheng Zhao, Yuan Dong, Nikolaos V. Boulgouris</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered important approaches towards foundational machine intelligence, achieving remarkable success in Natural Language Processing and multimodal tasks, among others. However, the carbon footprints and financial costs originating from heavy pre-training computation is a non-negligible issue. Progressive training methods, inspired by the neurogenesis process that grows neural structures, have shown potential to accelerate LLM pre-training. However, the algorithms, implementation, and practices for progressively training LLMs beyond 100B parameters remain underexplored. In this paper, we show that our model, namely FLM-101B, trained with our growth strategy under a budget of \$100K, reaches 80\% of the baselines' performances with only 10\% of their floating-point operations. We believe that further studies on progressive training will benefit the community by cutting down the costs and promoting green AI. The checkpoint of FLM-101B is released at https://huggingface.co/CofeAI/FLM-101B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Gao, Wenxuan Zhang, Guizhen Chen, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs), but existing text-to-text methods, referred to as TextTuning, struggle with issues such as generalization, robustness, and controllability due to their lack of explicit task structures. We introduce JsonTuning, a structure-to-structure approach that uses JSON structures to represent tasks. This method improves generalization by clarifying task elements and their relations, boosts robustness by minimizing ambiguity, and enhances controllability by allowing precise control over outputs. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis between JsonTuning and TextTuning using various language models and benchmarks. Our findings reveal that JsonTuning consistently surpasses TextTuning in terms of performance, robustness, and controllability across different scenarios. By overcoming the limitations of TextTuning, JsonTuning demonstrates significant potential for developing more effective and reliable LLMs capable of handling diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Zhou, Emmy Liu, Graham Neubig, Michael J. Tarr, Leila Wehbe</p>
<p>Abstract: Do machines and humans process language in similar ways? Recent research has hinted at the affirmative, showing that human neural activity can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using an LLM-based data-driven approach, we identify two domains that LMs do not capture well: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We validate these findings with human behavioral experiments and hypothesize that the gap is due to insufficient representations of social/emotional and physical knowledge in LMs. Our results show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language. On the other hand, personalized LLM response generation holds the potential to offer substantial benefits for individuals in critical areas such as medical. Existing research has explored memory-augmented methods to prompt the LLM with pre-stored user-specific knowledge for personalized response generation in terms of new queries. We contend that such paradigm is unable to perceive fine-granularity information. In this study, we propose a novel \textbf{M}emory-\textbf{i}njected approach using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and along with a Bayesian Optimisation searching strategy to achieve \textbf{L}LM \textbf{P}ersonalization(\textbf{MiLP}).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Xia, Xuefeng Li, Yixin Liu, Tongshuang Wu, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The leaderboard of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical tasks has been continuously updated. However, the majority of evaluations focus solely on the final results, neglecting the quality of the intermediate steps. This oversight can mask underlying problems, such as logical errors or unnecessary steps in the reasoning process. To measure reasoning beyond final-answer accuracy, we introduce ReasonEval, a new methodology for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps. ReasonEval employs validity and redundancy to characterize the reasoning quality, as well as accompanying LLMs to assess them automatically. We explore different design options for the LLM-based evaluators and empirically demonstrate that ReasonEval, when instantiated with base models possessing strong mathematical knowledge and trained with high-quality labeled data, consistently outperforms baseline methods in the meta-evaluation datasets. We also highlight the strong generalization capabilities of ReasonEval. By utilizing ReasonEval to evaluate LLMs specialized in math, we find that an increase in final-answer accuracy does not necessarily guarantee an improvement in the overall quality of the reasoning steps for challenging mathematical problems. Additionally, we observe that ReasonEval can play a significant role in data selection. We open-source the best-performing model, meta-evaluation script, and all evaluation results to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edirlei Soares de Lima, Margot M. E. Neggers, Antonio L. Furtado</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper shows how to construct genre patterns, whose purpose is to guide interactive story composition in a way that enforces thematic consistency. To start the discussion we argue, based on previous seminal works, for the existence of five fundamental genres, namely comedy, romance - in the sense of epic plots, flourishing since the twelfth century -, tragedy, satire, and mystery. To construct the patterns, a simple two-phase process is employed: first retrieving examples that match our genre characterizations, and then applying a form of most specific generalization to the groups of examples in order to find their commonalities. In both phases, AI agents are instrumental, with our PatternTeller prototype being called to operate the story composition process, offering the opportunity to generate stories from a given premise of the user, to be developed under the guidance of the chosen pattern and trying to accommodate the user's suggestions along the composition stages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernal Jim\'enez Guti\'errez, Yiheng Shu, Yu Gu, Michihiro Yasunaga, Yu Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments, mammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world and continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable deeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop question answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves comparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while being 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into IRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can tackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Yang, He Zhao, Dinh Phung, Wray Buntine, Lan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Topic modeling has been a widely used tool for unsupervised text analysis. However, comprehensive evaluations of a topic model remain challenging. Existing evaluation methods are either less comparable across different models (e.g., perplexity) or focus on only one specific aspect of a model (e.g., topic quality or document representation quality) at a time, which is insufficient to reflect the overall model performance. In this paper, we propose WALM (Word Agreement with Language Model), a new evaluation method for topic modeling that considers the semantic quality of document representations and topics in a joint manner, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). With extensive experiments involving different types of topic models, WALM is shown to align with human judgment and can serve as a complementary evaluation method to the existing ones, bringing a new perspective to topic modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaang Li, Quan Wang, Zhongnan Wang, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require model editing to efficiently update specific knowledge within them and avoid factual errors. Most model editing methods are solely designed for single-time use and result in a significant forgetting effect in lifelong editing scenarios, where sequential edits are conducted over time. Previous approaches manage sequential edits by freezing original parameters and discretely allocating new parameters for each knowledge update. However, these methods lack robustness to minor input variations due to the discrete mapping between data and parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose ELDER, a novel approach to create a continuous association between data and adapters. ELDER integrates multiple LoRAs through a router network and is trained to establish a smooth data-adapter association, thereby enhancing the edit robustness and generalization of semantically equivalent inputs. To ensure inputs containing the same knowledge will be processed by the same LoRAs, we design a novel loss to guide the model link LoRA allocations with edit knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a deferral mechanism to retain the original LLM capabilities post-edit. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA2-7B demonstrate that ELDER effectively edits models in the lifelong setting, outperforming eight baselines while exhibiting strong scalability and preserving LLMs' general abilities on downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Pedro Gandarela, Danilo S. Carvalho, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a novel systematic methodology to analyse the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with feedback from a formal inference engine, on logic theory induction. The analysis is complexity-graded w.r.t. rule dependency structure, allowing quantification of specific inference challenges on LLM performance. Integrating LLMs with formal methods is a promising frontier in the Natural Language Processing field, as an important avenue for improving model inference control and explainability. In particular, inductive learning over complex sets of facts and rules, poses unique challenges for current autoregressive models, as they lack explicit symbolic grounding. While they can be complemented by formal systems, the properties delivered by LLMs regarding inductive learning, are not well understood and quantified. Empirical results indicate that the largest LLMs can achieve competitive results against a SOTA Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system baseline, but also that tracking long predicate relationship chains is a more difficult obstacle than theory complexity for LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article we present UNED-ACCESS 2024, a bilingual dataset that consists of 1003 multiple-choice questions of university entrance level exams in Spanish and English. Questions are originally formulated in Spanish and translated manually into English, and have not ever been publicly released. A selection of current open-source and proprietary models are evaluated in a uniform zero-shot experimental setting both on the UNED-ACCESS 2024 dataset and on an equivalent subset of MMLU questions. Results show that (i) reasoning questions are challenging for models, (ii) smaller models perform worse than larger models and degrade faster in Spanish than in English and (iii) the performance gap between languages is negligible for the best models and grows up to 37% for smaller models. Model ranking on UNED-ACCESS 2024 is almost identical in English and Spanish, and has also a high correlation (0.98 Pearson) with ranking on MMLU, suggesting that a small dataset is sufficiently diverse and representative to measure performance by discipline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Yu, Baolin Peng, Vineeth Vajipey, Hao Cheng, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao, Zhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han He, Qianchu Liu, Lei Xu, Chaitanya Shivade, Yi Zhang, Sundararajan Srinivasan, Katrin Kirchhoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing automatic prompt engineering methods are typically designed for discriminative tasks, where new task prompts are iteratively refined with limited feedback from a single metric reflecting a single aspect. However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA. Code available at https://github.com/amazon-science/crispo</p>

<p>Abstract: Language is not monolithic. While benchmarks, including those designed for multiple languages, are often used as proxies to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they tend to overlook the nuances of within-language variation, and thus fail to model the experience of speakers of non-standard dialects. Focusing on African American Vernacular English (AAVE), we present the first study aimed at objectively assessing the fairness and robustness of LLMs in handling dialects in canonical reasoning tasks, including algorithm, math, logic, and integrated reasoning. We introduce \textbf{ReDial} (\textbf{Re}asoning with \textbf{Dial}ect Queries), a benchmark containing 1.2K+ parallel query pairs in Standardized English and AAVE. We hire AAVE speakers, including experts with computer science backgrounds, to rewrite seven popular benchmarks, such as HumanEval and GSM8K. With ReDial, we evaluate widely used LLMs, including GPT, Claude, Llama, Mistral, and the Phi model families. Our findings reveal that \textbf{almost all of these widely used models show significant brittleness and unfairness to queries in AAVE}. Our work establishes a systematic and objective framework for analyzing LLM bias in dialectal queries. Moreover, it highlights how mainstream LLMs provide unfair service to dialect speakers in reasoning tasks, laying a critical foundation for relevant future research.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) exhibits promise in the clinical domain. However, it is constrained by data scarcity and ethical considerations, as the generation of clinical trials presents significant challenges due to stringent privacy regulations, high costs, and the extended duration required for conducting studies with human participants. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in general generation tasks, their potential in facilitating the generation of synthetic clinical trials is under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Reasoning few-shot framework that leverages LLMs to generate artificial yet realistic and diverse clinical trials with binary success/failure labels. Experiments conducted on real clinical trials from the \url{ClinicalTrials.gov} database demonstrate that our synthetic data can effectively augment real datasets. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pre-trained model as a binary classifier on synthetic clinical trial datasets, we demonstrate that this augmentation enhances model training for downstream tasks such as trial outcome prediction. Our findings suggest that LLMs for synthetic clinical trial generation hold promise for accelerating clinical research and upholding ethical standards for patient privacy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yang, Qingping Yang, Yingwei Ma, Runtao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities is essential for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in solving mathematical problems, existing benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH present limitations, including narrow problem definitions with specific numbers and reliance on predetermined rules that hinder accurate assessments of reasoning and generality. This paper introduces the UTMath Benchmark, a robust evaluation framework designed to assess LLMs through extensive unit tests, with a focus on both the accuracy and generality of model responses. It comprises 1,053 cutting-edge problems spanning nine mathematical domains, with an average of 68 test cases per problem. UTMath is highly challenging, with the best-performing model, o1-mini, solving only 32.57\% of the problems, followed by o1-preview at 27.16\%, and GPT-4o at 26.93\%. Furthermore, we present the Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach, which encourages LLMs to engage in explicit reasoning prior to code generation, thereby facilitating the production of more sophisticated solutions and enhancing overall performance and efficiency. Additionally, we also release the UTMath-Train training dataset (more than 70k samples), to support the community in further exploring mathematical reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktoriia Chekalina, Anton Razzhigaev, Elizaveta Goncharova, Andrey Kuznetsov</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as an additional modality. Our method involves transforming input text into a set of KG embeddings and using an adapter to integrate these embeddings into the language model space, without relying on external retrieval processes.
  To facilitate this, we created WikiEntities, a dataset containing over 3 million Wikipedia texts annotated with entities from Wikidata and their corresponding embeddings from PyTorch-BigGraph. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training Entity Linking models and adapting the described method to various LLMs using specialized adapters.
  Our method does not require fine-tuning of the language models themselves; instead, we only train the adapter. This ensures that the model's performance on other tasks is not affected. We trained an adapter for the Mistral 7B, LLaMA 2-7B (chat), and LLaMA 3-8B (instruct) models using this dataset and demonstrated that our approach improves performance on the HaluEval, True-False benchmarks and FEVER dataset. The results indicate that incorporating KGs as a new modality can effectively reduce hallucinations and improve the factual accuracy of language models, all without the need for external retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model(LLM) performance on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have stimulated interest from healthcare providers and patients globally. Particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) facing acute physician shortages and lack of specialists, LLMs offer a potentially scalable pathway to enhance healthcare access and reduce costs. However, their effectiveness in the Global South, especially across the African continent, remains to be established. In this work, we introduce AfriMed-QA, the first large scale Pan-African English multi-specialty medical Question-Answering (QA) dataset, 15,000 questions (open and closed-ended) sourced from over 60 medical schools across 16 countries, covering 32 medical specialties. We further evaluate 30 LLMs across multiple axes including correctness and demographic bias. Our findings show significant performance variation across specialties and geographies, MCQ performance clearly lags USMLE (MedQA). We find that biomedical LLMs underperform general models and smaller edge-friendly LLMs struggle to achieve a passing score. Interestingly, human evaluations show a consistent consumer preference for LLM answers and explanations when compared with clinician answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wang, Yuxiang Zhang, Yanxu Zhu, Xinyan Wen, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: The o1 system card identifies the o1 models as the most robust within OpenAI, with their defining characteristic being the progression from rapid, intuitive thinking to slower, more deliberate reasoning. This observation motivated us to investigate the influence of System-2 thinking patterns on model safety. In our preliminary research, we conducted safety evaluations of the o1 model, including complex jailbreak attack scenarios using adversarial natural language prompts and mathematical encoding prompts. Our findings indicate that the o1 model demonstrates relatively improved safety performance; however, it still exhibits vulnerabilities, particularly against jailbreak attacks employing mathematical encoding. Through detailed case analysis, we identified specific patterns in the o1 model's responses. We also explored the alignment of System-2 safety in open-source models using prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning techniques. Experimental results show that some simple methods to encourage the model to carefully scrutinize user requests are beneficial for model safety. Additionally, we proposed a implementation plan for process supervision to enhance safety alignment. The implementation details and experimental results will be provided in future versions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Sadallah, Daria Kotova, Ekaterina Kochmar</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryptic crosswords are puzzles that rely on general knowledge and the solver's ability to manipulate language on different levels, dealing with various types of wordplay. Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor performance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for three popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance on this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate why these models struggle to achieve superior performance. We release our code and introduced datasets at https://github.com/bodasadallah/decrypting-crosswords.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuemei Tang, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: The literature review is a crucial form of academic writing that involves complex processes of literature collection, organization, and summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced promising tools to automate these processes. However, their actual capabilities in writing comprehensive literature reviews remain underexplored, such as whether they can generate accurate and reliable references. To address this gap, we propose a framework to assess the literature review writing ability of LLMs automatically. We evaluate the performance of LLMs across three tasks: generating references, writing abstracts, and writing literature reviews. We employ external tools for a multidimensional evaluation, which includes assessing hallucination rates in references, semantic coverage, and factual consistency with human-written context. By analyzing the experimental results, we find that, despite advancements, even the most sophisticated models still cannot avoid generating hallucinated references. Additionally, different models exhibit varying performance in literature review writing across different disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixi Lin, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning, which allows large language models to perform diverse tasks with a few demonstrations, is found to have imbalanced per-class prediction accuracy on multi-class text classification. Although notable output correction methods have been developed to tackle the issue and simultaneously improve downstream prediction accuracy, they may fail to answer the core interpretability challenges: why and which certain classes need corrections, and more importantly, a tailored correction for per-sample, per-class's probability. To address such interpretability gaps, we first find that the imbalance arises from certain classes consistently receiving high ICL output probabilities, whereas others receiving lower or mixed ranges, so the former is more frequently chosen, resulting in higher accuracy; more crucially, we find that these ranges have significantly varying degrees of influence on the accuracy bias, highlighting the need for precise, interpretable probability corrections by range. Motivated by this, we propose FuRud, a Fuzzy Rule Optimization based Debiasing method, that (1) detects which classes need corrections, and (2) for each correction-needed class, detects its probability ranges and applies asymmetric amplifications or reductions to correct them interpretably. Notably, across seven benchmark datasets, FuRud reduces the pairwise class accuracy bias (COBias) by more than half (56%), while achieving a relative increase of 21% in accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing methods. Moreover, FuRud can optimize downstream tasks with as few as 10 optimization examples. Furthermore, FuRud can work for prompt formats that lead to highly skewed predictions. For example, FuRud greatly improves ICL outputs which use letter options, with 44% relative accuracy increase and 54% relative COBias reduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation prevails in large language models, embedding models are becoming increasingly crucial. Despite the growing number of general embedding models, prior work often overlooks the critical role of training data quality. In this work, we introduce KaLM-Embedding, a general multilingual embedding model that leverages a large quantity of cleaner, more diverse, and domain-specific training data. Our model has been trained with key techniques proven to enhance performance: (1) persona-based synthetic data to create diversified examples distilled from LLMs, (2) ranking consistency filtering to remove less informative samples, and (3) semi-homogeneous task batch sampling to improve training efficacy. Departing from traditional BERT-like architectures, we adopt Qwen2-0.5B as the pre-trained model, facilitating the adaptation of auto-regressive language models for general embedding tasks. Extensive evaluations of the MTEB benchmark across multiple languages show that our model outperforms others of comparable size, setting a new standard for multilingual embedding models with <1B parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei He, Jian Yuan, Haoli Bai, Jingwen Leng, Bo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient key-value (KV) cache compression is critical for scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in long sequences and resource-limited settings. Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.</p>

It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixiang Jiang, Lingbo Liu, Changwen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the demonstrated parameter efficiency of prompt-based multimodal fusion methods, their limited adaptivity and expressiveness often result in suboptimal performance compared to other tuning approaches. In this paper, we introduce the Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE), the first technique designed to overcome these limitations by decomposing standard prompts to capture instance-level features adaptively. Building on this decomposition, MoPE enhances prompt fusion's expressiveness by leveraging multimodal pairing priors to route the most effective prompt for each instance dynamically. Compared to vanilla prompting, our MoPE-based fusion method exhibits greater expressiveness, scaling more effectively with the training data and the overall number of trainable parameters. We also investigate regularization terms for expert routing, which lead to emergent expert specialization with enhanced adaptiveness and interpretablity. Extensive experiments across six multimodal datasets spanning four modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for prompt fusion, matching or even surpassing the performance of fine-tuning while requiring only 0.8% of the trainable parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zang, Tian Yun, Hao Tan, Trung Bui, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Do vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained to caption an image of a "durian" learn visual concepts such as "brown" (color) and "spiky" (texture) at the same time? We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned "for free" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. "spiky" as opposed to "spiky durian"), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects. All code and models are publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yui Sudo, Muhammad Shakeel, Yosuke Fukumoto, Brian Yan, Jiatong Shi, Yifan Peng, Shinji Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) can be classified by its decoder architectures, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), attention-based encoder-decoder, and Mask-CTC models. Each decoder architecture has advantages and disadvantages, leading practitioners to switch between these different models depending on application requirements. Instead of building separate models, we propose a joint modeling scheme where four decoders (CTC, RNN-T, attention, and Mask-CTC) share the same encoder -- we refer to this as 4D modeling. The 4D model is trained jointly, which will bring model regularization and maximize the model robustness thanks to their complementary properties. To efficiently train the 4D model, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that stabilizes the joint training. In addition, we propose three novel joint beam search algorithms by combining three decoders (CTC, RNN-T, and attention) to further improve performance. These three beam search algorithms differ in which decoder is used as the primary decoder. We carefully evaluate the performance and computational tradeoffs associated with each algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the jointly trained 4D model outperforms the E2E-ASR models trained with only one individual decoder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed joint beam search algorithm outperforms the previously proposed CTC/attention decoding.</p>

Our method automatically and dynamically selects the learning rate that accelerates the convergence, without the intensive tuning of the learning rate scheduler. In practice, our method is easily implementable, since it only requires additional forward passes with almost zero computational overhead (in terms of training time and memory cost), if the overhead is amortized over many iterations. We present extensive experiments on language and vision tasks (e.g. GPT and ResNet) to showcase that GeN optimizers match the state-of-the-art performance, which was achieved with carefully tuned learning rate schedulers.</p>

<p>Abstract: With significant advancements in Transformers LLMs, NLP has extended its reach into many research fields due to its enhanced capabilities in text generation and user interaction. One field benefiting greatly from these advancements is cybersecurity. In cybersecurity, many parameters that need to be protected and exchanged between senders and receivers are in the form of text and tabular data, making NLP a valuable tool in enhancing the security measures of communication protocols. This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the utilization of Transformers and LLMs in cyber-threat detection systems. The methodology of paper selection and bibliometric analysis is outlined to establish a rigorous framework for evaluating existing research. The fundamentals of Transformers are discussed, including background information on various cyber-attacks and datasets commonly used in this field. The survey explores the application of Transformers in IDSs, focusing on different architectures such as Attention-based models, LLMs like BERT and GPT, CNN/LSTM-Transformer hybrids, emerging approaches like ViTs, among others. Furthermore, it explores the diverse environments and applications where Transformers and LLMs-based IDS have been implemented, including computer networks, IoT devices, critical infrastructure protection, cloud computing, SDN, as well as in autonomous vehicles. The paper also addresses research challenges and future directions in this area, identifying key issues such as interpretability, scalability, and adaptability to evolving threats, and more. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the findings and highlights the significance of Transformers and LLMs in enhancing cyber-threat detection capabilities, while also outlining potential avenues for further research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aldo Gangemi, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKG) face challenges with scalability, flexibility, contextual understanding, and handling unstructured or ambiguous information. However, they offer formal and structured knowledge enabling highly interpretable and reliable results by means of reasoning and querying. Large Language Models (LLMs) overcome those limitations making them suitable in open-ended tasks and unstructured environments. Nevertheless, LLMs are neither interpretable nor reliable. To solve the dichotomy between LLMs and SKGs we envision Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) that combines the benefits of the two worlds. LAG uses LLMs as Reactive Continuous Knowledge Graphs that can generate potentially infinite relations and tacit knowledge on-demand. SKGs are key for injecting a discrete heuristic dimension with clear logical and factual boundaries. We exemplify LAG in two tasks of collective intelligence, i.e., medical diagnostics and climate projections. Understanding the properties and limitations of LAG, which are still mostly unknown, is of utmost importance for enabling a variety of tasks involving tacit knowledge in order to provide interpretable and effective results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chancharik Mitra, Brandon Huang, Tianning Chai, Zhiqiu Lin, Assaf Arbelle, Rogerio Feris, Leonid Karlinsky, Trevor Darrell, Deva Ramanan, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like LLaVA and Qwen-VL excel at a wide variety of vision-language (VL) tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering. Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehun Kim, Ji-Hoon Kim, Yeunju Choi, Tan Dat Nguyen, Seongkyu Mun, Joon Son Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of voice conversion is to transform the speech of a source speaker to sound like that of a reference speaker while preserving the original content. A key challenge is to extract disentangled linguistic content from the source and voice style from the reference. While existing approaches leverage various methods to isolate the two, a generalization still requires further attention, especially for robustness in zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we achieve successful disentanglement of content and speaker features by tuning self-supervised speech features with adapters. The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content. Moreover, we leverage a conditional flow matching decoder with cross-attention speaker conditioning to further boost the synthesis quality and efficiency. Subjective and objective evaluations in a zero-shot scenario demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in speech quality and similarity to the reference speech.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce $\text{Transformer}^2$, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, $\text{Transformer}^2$ employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific "expert" vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. $\text{Transformer}^2$ demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. $\text{Transformer}^2$ represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of vision-language models (VLMs) is driven by large-scale and diverse multimodal datasets. However, progress toward generalist biomedical VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains, missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable, open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible dataset. Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming, eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally. On average, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology, parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a 6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while using 10x less compute. To foster reproducibility and collaboration, we release our codebase and dataset for the broader research community.</p>
