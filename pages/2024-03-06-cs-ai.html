<p><b>Authors:</b> Asad Anjum, Yuting Li, Noelle Law, M Charity, Julian Togelius</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies how large language models (LLMs) can act as effective, high-level creative collaborators and ``muses'' for game design. We model the design of this study after the exercises artists use by looking at amorphous ink splotches for creative inspiration. Our goal is to determine whether AI-assistance can improve, hinder, or provide an alternative quality to games when compared to the creative intents implemented by human designers. The capabilities of LLMs as game designers are stress tested by placing it at the forefront of the decision making process. Three prototype games are designed across 3 different genres: (1) a minimalist base game, (2) a game with features and game feel elements added by a human game designer, and (3) a game with features and feel elements directly implemented from prompted outputs of the LLM, ChatGPT. A user study was conducted and participants were asked to blindly evaluate the quality and their preference of these games. We discuss both the development process of communicating creative intent to an AI chatbot and the synthesized open feedback of the participants. We use this data to determine both the benefits and shortcomings of AI in a more design-centric role.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02482">MORBDD: Multiobjective Restricted Binary Decision Diagrams by Learning to Sparsify</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Patel, Elias B. Khalil, David Bergman</p>
<p>Abstract: In multicriteria decision-making, a user seeks a set of non-dominated solutions to a (constrained) multiobjective optimization problem, the so-called Pareto frontier. In this work, we seek to bring a state-of-the-art method for exact multiobjective integer linear programming into the heuristic realm. We focus on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) which first construct a graph that represents all feasible solutions to the problem and then traverse the graph to extract the Pareto frontier. Because the Pareto frontier may be exponentially large, enumerating it over the BDD can be time-consuming. We explore how restricted BDDs, which have already been shown to be effective as heuristics for single-objective problems, can be adapted to multiobjective optimization through the use of machine learning (ML). MORBDD, our ML-based BDD sparsifier, first trains a binary classifier to eliminate BDD nodes that are unlikely to contribute to Pareto solutions, then post-processes the sparse BDD to ensure its connectivity via optimization. Experimental results on multiobjective knapsack problems show that MORBDD is highly effective at producing very small restricted BDDs with excellent approximation quality, outperforming width-limited restricted BDDs and the well-known evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transformer models have been extensively used with good results in a wide area of machine learning applications including Large Language Models and image generation. Here, we inquire on the applicability of this approach to financial time series. We first describe the dataset construction for two prototypical situations: a mean reverting synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on one hand and real S&P500 data on the other hand. Then, we present in detail the proposed Transformer architecture and finally we discuss some encouraging results. For the synthetic data we predict rather accurately the next move, and for the S&P500 we get some interesting results related to quadratic variation and volatility prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pittawat Taveekitworachai, Febri Abdullah, Mury F. Dewantoro, Yi Xia, Pratch Suntichaikul, Ruck Thawonmas, Julian Togelius, Jochen Renz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the second ChatGPT4PCG competition at the 2024 IEEE Conference on Games. In this edition of the competition, we follow the first edition, but make several improvements and changes. We introduce a new evaluation metric along with allowing a more flexible format for participants' submissions and making several improvements to the evaluation pipeline. Continuing from the first edition, we aim to foster and explore the realm of prompt engineering (PE) for procedural content generation (PCG). While the first competition saw success, it was hindered by various limitations; we aim to mitigate these limitations in this edition. We introduce diversity as a new metric to discourage submissions aimed at producing repetitive structures. Furthermore, we allow submission of a Python program instead of a prompt text file for greater flexibility in implementing advanced PE approaches, which may require control flow, including conditions and iterations. We also make several improvements to the evaluation pipeline with a better classifier for similarity evaluation and better-performing function signatures. We thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the new metric and the improved classifier. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to select a function signature to instruct ChatGPT for level generation. Finally, we provide implementation examples of various PE techniques in Python and evaluate their preliminary performance. We hope this competition serves as a resource and platform for learning about PE and PCG in general.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02635">PPS-QMIX: Periodically Parameter Sharing for Accelerating Convergence of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Zhang, DanDan Zhu, Qiuhan Xu, Hao Zhou, Ce Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Training for multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) is a time-consuming process caused by distribution shift of each agent. One drawback is that strategy of each agent in MARL is independent but actually in cooperation. Thus, a vertical issue in multi-agent reinforcement learning is how to efficiently accelerate training process. To address this problem, current research has leveraged a centralized function(CF) across multiple agents to learn contribution of the team reward for each agent. However, CF based methods introduce joint error from other agents in estimation of value network. In so doing, inspired by federated learning, we propose three simple novel approaches called Average Periodically Parameter Sharing(A-PPS), Reward-Scalability Periodically Parameter Sharing(RS-PPS) and Partial Personalized Periodically Parameter Sharing(PP-PPS) mechanism to accelerate training of MARL. Agents share Q-value network periodically during the training process. Agents which has same identity adapt collected reward as scalability and update partial neural network during period to share different parameters. We apply our approaches in classical MARL method QMIX and evaluate our approaches on various tasks in StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge(SMAC) environment. Performance of numerical experiments yield enormous enhancement, with an average improvement of 10\%-30\%, and enable to win tasks that QMIX cannot.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02719">Multi-Scale Subgraph Contrastive Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbei Liu, Yu Zhao, Xiao Wang, Lei Geng, Zhitao Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-level contrastive learning, aiming to learn the representations for each graph by contrasting two augmented graphs, has attracted considerable attention. Previous studies usually simply assume that a graph and its augmented graph as a positive pair, otherwise as a negative pair. However, it is well known that graph structure is always complex and multi-scale, which gives rise to a fundamental question: after graph augmentation, will the previous assumption still hold in reality? By an experimental analysis, we discover the semantic information of an augmented graph structure may be not consistent as original graph structure, and whether two augmented graphs are positive or negative pairs is highly related with the multi-scale structures. Based on this finding, we propose a multi-scale subgraph contrastive learning method which is able to characterize the fine-grained semantic information. Specifically, we generate global and local views at different scales based on subgraph sampling, and construct multiple contrastive relationships according to their semantic associations to provide richer self-supervised signals. Extensive experiments and parametric analysis on eight graph classification real-world datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02723">Minimum Topology Attacks for Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengmei Zhang, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi, Lingjuan Lyu, Tianchi Yang, Junping Du</p>
<p>Abstract: With the great popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their robustness to adversarial topology attacks has received significant attention. Although many attack methods have been proposed, they mainly focus on fixed-budget attacks, aiming at finding the most adversarial perturbations within a fixed budget for target node. However, considering the varied robustness of each node, there is an inevitable dilemma caused by the fixed budget, i.e., no successful perturbation is found when the budget is relatively small, while if it is too large, the yielding redundant perturbations will hurt the invisibility. To break this dilemma, we propose a new type of topology attack, named minimum-budget topology attack, aiming to adaptively find the minimum perturbation sufficient for a successful attack on each node. To this end, we propose an attack model, named MiBTack, based on a dynamic projected gradient descent algorithm, which can effectively solve the involving non-convex constraint optimization on discrete topology. Extensive results on three GNNs and four real-world datasets show that MiBTack can successfully lead all target nodes misclassified with the minimum perturbation edges. Moreover, the obtained minimum budget can be used to measure node robustness, so we can explore the relationships of robustness, topology, and uncertainty for nodes, which is beyond what the current fixed-budget topology attacks can offer.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02745">CURATRON: Complete Robust Preference Data for Robust Alignment of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Son The Nguyen, Niranjan Uma Naresh, Theja Tulabandhula</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values via preference learning (PL), with a focus on the issues of incomplete and corrupted data in preference datasets. We propose a novel method for robustly and completely recalibrating values within these datasets to enhance LLMs resilience against the issues. In particular, we devise a guaranteed polynomial time ranking algorithm that robustifies several existing models, such as the classic Bradley--Terry--Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry, 1952) model and certain generalizations of it. To the best of our knowledge, our present work is the first to propose an algorithm that provably recovers an {\epsilon}-optimal ranking with high probability while allowing as large as O(n) perturbed pairwise comparison results per model response. Furthermore, we show robust recovery results in the partially observed setting. Our experiments confirm that our algorithms handle adversarial noise and unobserved comparisons well in both general and LLM preference dataset settings. This work contributes to the development and scaling of more reliable and ethically aligned AI models by equipping the dataset curation pipeline with the ability to handle missing and maliciously manipulated inputs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02760">Emerging Synergies Between Large Language Models and Machine Learning in Ecommerce Recommendations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaonan Xu, Zheng Xu, Zhipeng Ling, Zhengyu Jin, ShuQian Du</p>
<p>Abstract: With the boom of e-commerce and web applications, recommender systems have become an important part of our daily lives, providing personalized recommendations based on the user's preferences. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant progress in improving recommendation systems by simulating the interaction between users and items and incorporating their textual information, these DNN-based approaches still have some limitations, such as the difficulty of effectively understanding users' interests and capturing textual information. It is not possible to generalize to different seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reason about their predictions. At the same time, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to their superior capabilities in the basic tasks of language understanding and generation, and their impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent research has sought to harness the power of LLM to improve recommendation systems. Given the rapid development of this research direction in the field of recommendation systems, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of existing LLM-driven recommendation systems for researchers and practitioners in related fields to gain insight into. More specifically, we first introduced a representative approach to learning user and item representations using LLM as a feature encoder. We then reviewed the latest advances in LLMs techniques for collaborative filtering enhanced recommendation systems from the three paradigms of pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we had a comprehensive discussion on the future direction of this emerging field.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02775">EasyQuant: An Efficient Data-free Quantization Algorithm for LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Tang, Yifu Sun, Decheng Wu, Kai Liu, Jianchen Zhu, Zhanhui Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be very superior to conventional methods in various tasks. However, their expensive computations and high memory requirements are prohibitive for deployment. Model quantization is an effective method for reducing this overhead. The problem is that in most previous works, the quantized model was calibrated using few samples from the training data, which might affect the generalization of the quantized LLMs to unknown cases and tasks. Hence in this work, we explore an important question: Can we design a data-independent quantization method for LLMs to guarantee its generalization performance? In this work, we propose EasyQuant, a training-free and data-independent weight-only quantization algorithm for LLMs. Our observation indicates that two factors: outliers in the weight and quantization ranges, are essential for reducing the quantization error. Therefore, in EasyQuant, we leave the outliers (less than 1%) unchanged and optimize the quantization range to reduce the reconstruction error. With these methods, we surprisingly find that EasyQuant achieves comparable performance to the original model. Since EasyQuant does not depend on any training data, the generalization performance of quantized LLMs is safely guaranteed. Moreover, EasyQuant can be implemented in parallel so that the quantized model could be attained in a few minutes even for LLMs over 100B. To our best knowledge, we are the first work that achieves almost lossless quantization performance for LLMs under a data-independent setting and our algorithm runs over 10 times faster than the data-dependent methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S\'ebastien VerelLISIC, Sarah ThomsonLISIC, Omar RifkiLISIC</p>
<p>Abstract: The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is one of the major domains in the field of evolutionary computation, and more widely in combinatorial optimization. This paper studies the phase transition of the QAP, which can be described as a dramatic change in the problem's computational complexity and satisfiability, within a narrow range of the problem parameters. To approach this phenomenon, we introduce a new QAP-SAT design of the initial problem based on submodularity to capture its difficulty with new features. This decomposition is studied experimentally using branch-and-bound and tabu search solvers. A phase transition parameter is then proposed. The critical parameter of phase transition satisfaction and that of the solving effort are shown to be highly correlated for tabu search, thus allowing the prediction of difficult instances.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02795">Evaluating and Optimizing Educational Content with Large Language Model Judgments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joy He-Yueya, Noah D. Goodman, Emma Brunskill</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating effective educational materials generally requires expensive and time-consuming studies of student learning outcomes. To overcome this barrier, one idea is to build computational models of student learning and use them to optimize instructional materials. However, it is difficult to model the cognitive processes of learning dynamics. We propose an alternative approach that uses Language Models (LMs) as educational experts to assess the impact of various instructions on learning outcomes. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 to evaluate the overall effect of instructional materials on different student groups and find that it can replicate well-established educational findings such as the Expertise Reversal Effect and the Variability Effect. This demonstrates the potential of LMs as reliable evaluators of educational content. Building on this insight, we introduce an instruction optimization approach in which one LM generates instructional materials using the judgments of another LM as a reward function. We apply this approach to create math word problem worksheets aimed at maximizing student learning gains. Human teachers' evaluations of these LM-generated worksheets show a significant alignment between the LM judgments and human teacher preferences. We conclude by discussing potential divergences between human and LM opinions and the resulting pitfalls of automating instructional design.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02820">Reconstruction for Sparse View Tomography of Long Objects Applied to Imaging in the Wood Industry</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Buda Baji\'c, Johannes A. J. Huber, Benedikt Neyses, Linus Olofsson, Ozan \"Oktem</p>
<p>Abstract: In the wood industry, logs are commonly quality screened by discrete X-ray scans on a moving conveyor belt from a few source positions. Typically, two-dimensional (2D) slice-wise measurements are obtained by a sequential scanning geometry. Each 2D slice alone does not carry sufficient information for a three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction in which biological features of interest in the log are well preserved. In the present work, we propose a learned iterative reconstruction method based on the Learned Primal-Dual neural network, suited for sequential scanning geometries. Our method accumulates information between neighbouring slices, instead of only accounting for single slices during reconstruction. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations with as few as five source positions show that our method yields reconstructions of logs that are sufficiently accurate to identify biological features like knots (branches), heartwood and sapwood.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younghan Lee, Sohee Jun, Yungi Cho, Woorim Han, Hyungon Moon, Yunheung Paek</p>
<p>Abstract: With growing popularity, deep learning (DL) models are becoming larger-scale, and only the companies with vast training datasets and immense computing power can manage their business serving such large models. Most of those DL models are proprietary to the companies who thus strive to keep their private models safe from the model extraction attack (MEA), whose aim is to steal the model by training surrogate models. Nowadays, companies are inclined to offload the models from central servers to edge/endpoint devices. As revealed in the latest studies, adversaries exploit this opportunity as new attack vectors to launch side-channel attack (SCA) on the device running victim model and obtain various pieces of the model information, such as the model architecture (MA) and image dimension (ID). Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of such a relationship for the first time and would benefit future MEA studies in both offensive and defensive sides in that they may learn which pieces of information exposed by SCA are more important than the others. Our analysis additionally reveals that by grasping the victim model information from SCA, MEA can get highly effective and successful even without any prior knowledge of the model. Finally, to evince the practicality of our analysis results, we empirically apply SCA, and subsequently, carry out MEA under realistic threat assumptions. The results show up to 5.8 times better performance than when the adversary has no model information about the victim model.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02899">Domain-Agnostic Mutual Prompting for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhekai Du, Xinyao Li, Fengling Li, Ke Lu, Lei Zhu, Jingjing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strives to minimize distribution discrepancy between domains, which neglects to harness rich semantics from data and struggles to handle complex domain shifts. A promising technique is to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models for more guided adaptation. Despite some endeavors, current methods often learn textual prompts to embed domain semantics for source and target domains separately and perform classification within each domain, limiting cross-domain knowledge transfer. Moreover, prompting only the language branch lacks flexibility to adapt both modalities dynamically. To bridge this gap, we propose Domain-Agnostic Mutual Prompting (DAMP) to exploit domain-invariant semantics by mutually aligning visual and textual embeddings. Specifically, the image contextual information is utilized to prompt the language branch in a domain-agnostic and instance-conditioned way. Meanwhile, visual prompts are imposed based on the domain-agnostic textual prompt to elicit domain-invariant visual embeddings. These two branches of prompts are learned mutually with a cross-attention module and regularized with a semantic-consistency loss and an instance-discrimination contrastive loss. Experiments on three UDA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DAMP over state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlei Jin, Yang Zhang, Dan Meng, Jun Wang, Jinghua Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, aims to create concise and accurate summaries, thereby significantly reducing the human effort required in processing large volumes of text. ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods; however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wu, Haomin Wen, Guibin Zhang, Yutong Xia, Kai Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Yu Zheng, Kun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ever-increasing sensor service, though opening a precious path and providing a deluge of earth system data for deep-learning-oriented earth science, sadly introduce a daunting obstacle to their industrial level deployment. Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal (termed DynST) of an industry-level deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02933">Fuzzy Datalog$^\exists$ over Arbitrary t-Norms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Lanzinger, Stefano Sferrazza, Przemys{\l}aw A. Wa{\l}\k{e}ga, Georg Gottlob</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in the area of Neuro-Symbolic AI is to perform logical reasoning in the presence of both neural and symbolic data. This requires combining heterogeneous data sources such as knowledge graphs, neural model predictions, structured databases, crowd-sourced data, and many more. To allow for such reasoning, we generalise the standard rule-based language Datalog with existential rules (commonly referred to as tuple-generating dependencies) to the fuzzy setting, by allowing for arbitrary t-norms in the place of classical conjunctions in rule bodies. The resulting formalism allows us to perform reasoning about data associated with degrees of uncertainty while preserving computational complexity results and the applicability of reasoning techniques established for the standard Datalog setting. In particular, we provide fuzzy extensions of Datalog chases which produce fuzzy universal models and we exploit them to show that in important fragments of the language, reasoning has the same complexity as in the classical setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Taheri, Masoud Daneshtalab, Jaan Raik, Maksim Jenihhin, Salvatore Pappalardo, Paul Jimenez, Bastien Deveautour, Alberto Bosio</p>
<p>Abstract: Systolic array has emerged as a prominent architecture for Deep Neural Network (DNN) hardware accelerators, providing high-throughput and low-latency performance essential for deploying DNNs across diverse applications. However, when used in safety-critical applications, reliability assessment is mandatory to guarantee the correct behavior of DNN accelerators. While fault injection stands out as a well-established practical and robust method for reliability assessment, it is still a very time-consuming process. This paper addresses the time efficiency issue by introducing a novel hierarchical software-based hardware-aware fault injection strategy tailored for systolic array-based DNN accelerators.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02950">A general approach to enhance the survivability of backdoor attacks by decision path coupling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Zhao, Dingji Wang, Bihuan Chen, Ziqian Chen, Xin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks have been one of the emerging security threats to deep neural networks (DNNs), leading to serious consequences. One of the mainstream backdoor defenses is model reconstruction-based. Such defenses adopt model unlearning or pruning to eliminate backdoors. However, little attention has been paid to survive from such defenses. To bridge the gap, we propose Venom, the first generic backdoor attack enhancer to improve the survivability of existing backdoor attacks against model reconstruction-based defenses. We formalize Venom as a binary-task optimization problem. The first is the original backdoor attack task to preserve the original attack capability, while the second is the attack enhancement task to improve the attack survivability. To realize the second task, we propose attention imitation loss to force the decision path of poisoned samples in backdoored models to couple with the crucial decision path of benign samples, which makes backdoors difficult to eliminate. Our extensive evaluation on two DNNs and three datasets has demonstrated that Venom significantly improves the survivability of eight state-of-the-art attacks against eight state-of-the-art defenses without impacting the capability of the original attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Li, Xiang Chen, Xiaojun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data, as a crucial form of data representation, exists in diverse formats on the Web. When confronted with complex and irregular tables, manual modification becomes a laborious task. This paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of table editing tasks. Existing research mainly focuses on regular-shaped tables, wherein instructions are used to generate code in SQL, Python, or Excel Office-script for manipulating the tables. Nevertheless, editing tables with irregular structures, particularly those containing merged cells spanning multiple rows, poses a challenge when using code. To address this, we introduce the WikiTableEdit dataset. Leveraging 26,531 tables from the WikiSQL dataset, we automatically generate natural language instructions for six distinct basic operations and the corresponding outcomes, resulting in over 200,000 instances. Subsequently, we evaluate several representative large language models on the WikiTableEdit dataset to demonstrate the challenge of this task. The dataset will be released to the community to promote related researches.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02985">Evolution Transformer: In-Context Evolutionary Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Tjarko Lange, Yingtao Tian, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolutionary optimization algorithms are often derived from loose biological analogies and struggle to leverage information obtained during the sequential course of optimization. An alternative promising approach is to leverage data and directly discover powerful optimization principles via meta-optimization. In this work, we follow such a paradigm and introduce Evolution Transformer, a causal Transformer architecture, which can flexibly characterize a family of Evolution Strategies. Given a trajectory of evaluations and search distribution statistics, Evolution Transformer outputs a performance-improving update to the search distribution. The architecture imposes a set of suitable inductive biases, i.e. the invariance of the distribution update to the order of population members within a generation and equivariance to the order of the search dimensions. We train the model weights using Evolutionary Algorithm Distillation, a technique for supervised optimization of sequence models using teacher algorithm trajectories. The resulting model exhibits strong in-context optimization performance and shows strong generalization capabilities to otherwise challenging neuroevolution tasks. We analyze the resulting properties of the Evolution Transformer and propose a technique to fully self-referentially train the Evolution Transformer, starting from a random initialization and bootstrapping its own learning progress. We provide an open source implementation under https://github.com/RobertTLange/evosax.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyang Hu, Yao Shu, Zongmin Yu, Zhaoxuan Wu, Xiangqiang Lin, Zhongxiang Dai, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03008">Knowledge Graphs as Context Sources for LLM-Based Explanations of Learning Recommendations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasan Abu-Rasheed, Christian Weber, Madjid Fathi</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of personalized education, the provision of comprehensible explanations for learning recommendations is of a great value to enhance the learner's understanding and engagement with the recommended learning content. Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in general have recently opened new doors for generating human-like explanations, for and along learning recommendations. However, their precision is still far away from acceptable in a sensitive field like education. To harness the abilities of LLMs, while still ensuring a high level of precision towards the intent of the learners, this paper proposes an approach to utilize knowledge graphs (KG) as a source of factual context, for LLM prompts, reducing the risk of model hallucinations, and safeguarding against wrong or imprecise information, while maintaining an application-intended learning context. We utilize the semantic relations in the knowledge graph to offer curated knowledge about learning recommendations. With domain-experts in the loop, we design the explanation as a textual template, which is filled and completed by the LLM. Domain experts were integrated in the prompt engineering phase as part of a study, to ensure that explanations include information that is relevant to the learner. We evaluate our approach quantitatively using Rouge-N and Rouge-L measures, as well as qualitatively with experts and learners. Our results show an enhanced recall and precision of the generated explanations compared to those generated solely by the GPT model, with a greatly reduced risk of generating imprecise information in the final learning explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Shi, Zhiyuan Sun, Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre C\^ot\'e, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a crucial task in embodied learning, requiring agents to interact with their environment through egocentric observations to fulfill natural language instructions. Recent advancements have seen a surge in employing large language models (LLMs) within a framework-centric approach to enhance performance in embodied learning tasks, including EIF. Despite these efforts, there exists a lack of a unified understanding regarding the impact of various components-ranging from visual perception to action execution-on task performance. To address this gap, we introduce OPEx, a comprehensive framework that delineates the core components essential for solving embodied learning tasks: Observer, Planner, and Executor. Through extensive evaluations, we provide a deep analysis of how each component influences EIF task performance. Furthermore, we innovate within this space by deploying a multi-agent dialogue strategy on a TextWorld counterpart, further enhancing task performance. Our findings reveal that LLM-centric design markedly improves EIF outcomes, identify visual perception and low-level action execution as critical bottlenecks, and demonstrate that augmenting LLMs with a multi-agent framework further elevates performance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03028">Word Importance Explains How Prompts Affect Language Model Outputs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Hackmann, Haniyeh Mahmoudian, Mark Steadman, Michael Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized numerous applications across industries. However, their "black box" nature often hinders the understanding of how they make specific decisions, raising concerns about their transparency, reliability, and ethical use. This study presents a method to improve the explainability of LLMs by varying individual words in prompts to uncover their statistical impact on the model outputs. This approach, inspired by permutation importance for tabular data, masks each word in the system prompt and evaluates its effect on the outputs based on the available text scores aggregated over multiple user inputs. Unlike classical attention, word importance measures the impact of prompt words on arbitrarily-defined text scores, which enables decomposing the importance of words into the specific measures of interest--including bias, reading level, verbosity, etc. This procedure also enables measuring impact when attention weights are not available. To test the fidelity of this approach, we explore the effect of adding different suffixes to multiple different system prompts and comparing subsequent generations with different large language models. Results show that word importance scores are closely related to the expected suffix importances for multiple scoring functions.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03165">Leveraging Federated Learning and Edge Computing for Recommendation Systems within Cloud Computing Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaqian Qi, Yaqian Qi, Xiangxiang Wang, Hanzhe Li, Jingxiao Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: To enable large-scale and efficient deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), the combination of AI and edge computing has spawned Edge Intelligence, which leverages the computing and communication capabilities of end devices and edge servers to process data closer to where it is generated. A key technology for edge intelligence is the privacy-protecting machine learning paradigm known as Federated Learning (FL), which enables data owners to train models without having to transfer raw data to third-party servers. However, FL networks are expected to involve thousands of heterogeneous distributed devices. As a result, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck. To reduce node failures and device exits, a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework is proposed, where a designated cluster leader supports the data owner through intermediate model aggregation. Therefore, based on the improvement of edge server resource utilization, this paper can effectively make up for the limitation of cache capacity. In order to mitigate the impact of soft clicks on the quality of user experience (QoE), the authors model the user QoE as a comprehensive system cost. To solve the formulaic problem, the authors propose a decentralized caching algorithm with federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and federated learning (FL), where multiple agents learn and make decisions independently</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangzhou Wang, Kaiwen Zhu, Fengming Zhu, Xinghu Yao, Shujie Zhang, Deheng Ye, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reaching consensus is key to multi-agent coordination. To accomplish a cooperative task, agents need to coherently select optimal joint actions to maximize the team reward. However, current cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods usually do not explicitly take consensus into consideration, which may cause miscoordination problem. In this paper, we propose a model-based consensus mechanism to explicitly coordinate multiple agents. The proposed Multi-agent Goal Imagination (MAGI) framework guides agents to reach consensus with an Imagined common goal. The common goal is an achievable state with high value, which is obtained by sampling from the distribution of future states. We directly model this distribution with a self-supervised generative model, thus alleviating the "curse of dimensinality" problem induced by multi-agent multi-step policy rollout commonly used in model-based methods. We show that such efficient consensus mechanism can guide all agents cooperatively reaching valuable future states. Results on Multi-agent Particle-Environments and Google Research Football environment demonstrate the superiority of MAGI in both sample efficiency and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing utilization of planning tools in practical scenarios has sparked an interest in generating multiple high-quality plans. Consequently, a range of computational problems under the general umbrella of top-quality planning were introduced over a short time period, each with its own definition. In this work, we show that the existing definitions can be unified into one, based on a dominance relation. The different computational problems, therefore, simply correspond to different dominance relations. Given the unified definition, we can now certify the top-quality of the solutions, leveraging existing certification of unsolvability and optimality. We show that task transformations found in the existing literature can be employed for the efficient certification of various top-quality planning problems and propose a novel transformation to efficiently certify loopless top-quality planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the success of foundation agents in specific tasks or scenarios. However, existing agents cannot generalize across different scenarios, mainly due to their diverse observation and action spaces and semantic gaps, or reliance on task-specific resources. In this work, we propose the General Computer Control (GCC) setting: building foundation agents that can master any computer task by taking only screen images (and possibly audio) of the computer as input, and producing keyboard and mouse operations as output, similar to human-computer interaction. To target GCC, we propose Cradle, an agent framework with strong reasoning abilities, including self-reflection, task inference, and skill curation, to ensure generalizability and self-improvement across various tasks. To demonstrate the capabilities of Cradle, we deploy it in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption II, serving as a preliminary attempt towards GCC with a challenging target. Our agent can follow the main storyline and finish real missions in this complex AAA game, with minimal reliance on prior knowledge and application-specific resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafaela MarteloRutgers University, Ruo-Qian WangRutgers University</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time flood forecasting plays a crucial role in enabling timely and effective emergency responses. However, a significant challenge lies in bridging the gap between complex numerical flood models and practical decision-making. Decision-makers often rely on experts to interpret these models for optimizing flood mitigation strategies. And the public requires complex techniques to inquiry and understand socio-cultural and institutional factors, often hinders the public's understanding of flood risks. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces an innovative solution: a customized AI Assistant powered by the GPT-4 Large Language Model. This AI Assistant is designed to facilitate effective communication between decision-makers, the general public, and flood forecasters, without the requirement of specialized knowledge. The new framework utilizes GPT-4's advanced natural language understanding and function calling capabilities to provide immediate flood alerts and respond to various flood-related inquiries. Our developed prototype integrates real-time flood warnings with flood maps and social vulnerability data. It also effectively translates complex flood zone information into actionable risk management advice. To assess its performance, we evaluated the prototype using six criteria within three main categories: relevance, error resilience, and understanding of context. Our research marks a significant step towards a more accessible and user-friendly approach in flood risk management. This study highlights the potential of advanced AI tools like GPT-4 in democratizing information and enhancing public engagement in critical social and environmental issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Savitha Sam Abraham, Marjan Alirezaie, Luc De Raedt</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of learning and reasoning is high on the research agenda in AI. Nevertheless, there is only a little attention to use existing background knowledge for reasoning about partially observed scenes to answer questions about the scene. Yet, we as humans use such knowledge frequently to infer plausible answers to visual questions (by eliminating all inconsistent ones). Such knowledge often comes in the form of constraints about objects and it tends to be highly domain or environment-specific. We contribute a novel benchmark called CLEVR-POC for reasoning-intensive visual question answering (VQA) in partially observable environments under constraints. In CLEVR-POC, knowledge in the form of logical constraints needs to be leveraged to generate plausible answers to questions about a hidden object in a given partial scene. For instance, if one has the knowledge that all cups are colored either red, green or blue and that there is only one green cup, it becomes possible to deduce the color of an occluded cup as either red or blue, provided that all other cups, including the green one, are observed. Through experiments, we observe that the low performance of pre-trained vision language models like CLIP (~ 22%) and a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 (~ 46%) on CLEVR-POC ascertains the necessity for frameworks that can handle reasoning-intensive tasks where environment-specific background knowledge is available and crucial. Furthermore, our demonstration illustrates that a neuro-symbolic model, which integrates an LLM like GPT-4 with a visual perception network and a formal logical reasoner, exhibits exceptional performance on CLEVR-POC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Wan, Xin Feng, Yining Bei, Zhiqi Gao, Zhicong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human emotions are essentially molded by lived experiences, from which we construct personalised meaning. The engagement in such meaning-making process has been practiced as an intervention in various psychotherapies to promote wellness. Nevertheless, to support recollecting and recounting lived experiences in everyday life remains under explored in HCI. It also remains unknown how technologies such as generative AI models can facilitate the meaning making process, and ultimately support affective mindfulness. In this paper we present Metamorpheus, an affective interface that engages users in a creative visual storytelling of emotional experiences during dreams. Metamorpheus arranges the storyline based on a dream's emotional arc, and provokes self-reflection through the creation of metaphorical images and text depictions. The system provides metaphor suggestions, and generates visual metaphors and text depictions using generative AI models, while users can apply generations to recolour and re-arrange the interface to be visually affective. Our experience-centred evaluation manifests that, by interacting with Metamorpheus, users can recall their dreams in vivid detail, through which they relive and reflect upon their experiences in a meaningful way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaoyu Tang, Jiawei Chen, Bowen Yu, Yaojie Lu, Cheng Fu, Haiyang Yu, Hongyu Lin, Fei Huang, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the role of information retrieval (IR) systems in the way to humans accessing information. Due to the isolated architecture and the limited interaction, existing IR systems are unable to fully accommodate the shift from directly providing information to humans to indirectly serving large language models. In this paper, we propose Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end, LLM-driven information retrieval architecture that can fully internalize the required abilities of IR systems into a single LLM and deeply leverage the capabilities of LLMs during IR process. Specifically, Self-retrieval internalizes the corpus to retrieve into a LLM via a natural language indexing architecture. Then the entire retrieval process is redefined as a procedure of document generation and self-assessment, which can be end-to-end executed using a single large language model. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only significantly outperforms previous retrieval approaches by a large margin, but also can significantly boost the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval augumented generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Hovhannisyan, A. E. Allahverdyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Simpson's paradox is an obstacle to establishing a probabilistic association between two events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given the third (lurking) random variable $B$. We focus on scenarios when the random variables $A$ (which combines $a_1$, $a_2$, and their complements) and $B$ have a common cause $C$ that need not be observed. Alternatively, we can assume that $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$. For such cases, the correct association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ is to be defined via conditioning over $C$. This set-up generalizes the original Simpson's paradox. Now its two contradicting options simply refer to two particular and different causes $C$. We show that if $B$ and $C$ are binary and $A$ is quaternary (the minimal and the most widespread situation for valid Simpson's paradox), the conditioning over any binary common cause $C$ establishes the same direction of the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ as the conditioning over $B$ in the original formulation of the paradox. Thus, for the minimal common cause, one should choose the option of Simpson's paradox that assumes conditioning over $B$ and not its marginalization. For tertiary (unobserved) common causes $C$ all three options of Simpson's paradox become possible (i.e. marginalized, conditional, and none of them), and one needs prior information on $C$ to choose the right option.</p>

In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into issues related to fake news and fact-checking, and will be examined against improving informational health and public digital health.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02352">ATP: Enabling Fast LLM Serving via Attention on Top Principal Keys</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Niu, Saurav Prakash, Salman Avestimehr</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new attention mechanism with linear complexity, ATP, that fixates \textbf{A}ttention on \textbf{T}op \textbf{P}rincipal keys, rather than on each individual token. Particularly, ATP is driven by an important observation that input sequences are typically low-rank, i.e., input sequences can be represented by a few principal bases. Therefore, instead of directly iterating over all the input tokens, ATP transforms inputs into an orthogonal space and computes attention only on the top principal bases (keys). Owing to the observed low-rank structure in input sequences, ATP is able to capture semantic relationships in input sequences with a few principal keys. Furthermore, the attention complexity is reduced from \emph{quadratic} to \emph{linear} without incurring a noticeable performance drop. ATP further reduces complexity for other linear layers with low-rank inputs, leading to more speedup compared to prior works that solely target the attention module. Our evaluations on various models (e.g., BERT and Llama) demonstrate that ATP achieves comparable accuracy with much lower computation and memory complexity than the standard attention mechanism. In particular, ATP barely loses accuracy with only $1/2$ principal keys, and only incurs around $2\%$ accuracy drops with $1/4$ principal keys.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Feng, Qiongyan Wang, Yutong Xia, Junlin Huang, Siru Zhong, Kun Wang, Shifen Cheng, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The air quality inference problem aims to utilize historical data from a limited number of observation sites to infer the air quality index at an unknown location. Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity. While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential. In this work, we make the first attempt to combine two different spatio-temporal perspectives, fields and graphs, by proposing a new model, Spatio-Temporal Field Neural Network, and its corresponding new framework, Pyramidal Inference. Extensive experiments validate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in nationwide air quality inference in the Chinese Mainland, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed model and framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Cai, Xin Mao, Zhihong Wang, Shangqing Zhao, Yuhao Zhou, Changxu Wu, Man Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) aims to fill in missing facts within a given temporal knowledge graph at a specific time. Existing methods, operating in real or complex spaces, have demonstrated promising performance in this task. This paper advances beyond conventional approaches by introducing more expressive quaternion representations for TKGC within hypercomplex space. Unlike existing quaternion-based methods, our study focuses on capturing time-sensitive relations rather than time-aware entities. Specifically, we model time-sensitive relations through time-aware rotation and periodic time translation, effectively capturing complex temporal variability. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate our method's capability to model symmetric, asymmetric, inverse, compositional, and evolutionary relation patterns. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets validate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the field of TKGC.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02360">Towards Optimal Customized Architecture for Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Contrastive Cloud-Edge Model Decoupling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyan Chen, Tian Du, Mu Wang, Tiancheng Gu, Yu Zhao, Gang Kou, Changqiao Xu, Dapeng Oliver Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning, as a promising distributed learning paradigm, enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple network edge clients without the need for central data collecting. However, the heterogeneity of edge data distribution drags the model towards the local minima, which can be distant from the global optimum. Such heterogeneity often leads to slow convergence and substantial communication overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel federated learning framework called FedCMD, a model decoupling tailored to the Cloud-edge supported federated learning that separates deep neural networks into a body for capturing shared representations in Cloud and a personalized head for migrating data heterogeneity. Our motivation is that, by the deep investigation of the performance of selecting different neural network layers as the personalized head, we found rigidly assigning the last layer as the personalized head in current studies is not always optimal. Instead, it is necessary to dynamically select the personalized layer that maximizes the training performance by taking the representation difference between neighbor layers into account. To find the optimal personalized layer, we utilize the low-dimensional representation of each layer to contrast feature distribution transfer and introduce a Wasserstein-based layer selection method, aimed at identifying the best-match layer for personalization. Additionally, a weighted global aggregation algorithm is proposed based on the selected personalized layer for the practical application of FedCMD. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our solution compared with nine state-of-the-art solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying-Hsuan Wu, Jun-Wei Hsieh, Li Xin, Shin-You Teng, Yi-Kuan Hsieh, Ming-Ching Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world datasets commonly exhibit noisy labels and class imbalance, such as long-tailed distributions. While previous research addresses this issue by differentiating noisy and clean samples, reliance on information from predictions based on noisy long-tailed data introduces potential errors. To overcome the limitations of prior works, we introduce an effective two-stage approach by combining soft-label refurbishing with multi-expert ensemble learning. In the first stage of robust soft label refurbishing, we acquire unbiased features through contrastive learning, making preliminary predictions using a classifier trained with a carefully designed BAlanced Noise-tolerant Cross-entropy (BANC) loss. In the second stage, our label refurbishment method is applied to obtain soft labels for multi-expert ensemble learning, providing a principled solution to the long-tail noisy label problem. Experiments conducted across multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our approach, Label Refurbishment considering Label Rarity (LR^2), achieving remarkable accuracies of 94.19% and 77.05% on simulated noisy CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 long-tail datasets, as well as 77.74% and 81.40% on real-noise long-tail datasets, Food-101N and Animal-10N, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, a human evaluation is carried out on how hyperparameter settings impact the quality of Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for the low-resourced English--Irish pair. SentencePiece models using both Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and unigram approaches were appraised. Variations in model architectures included modifying the number of layers, evaluating the optimal number of heads for attention and testing various regularisation techniques. The greatest performance improvement was recorded for a Transformer-optimized model with a 16k BPE subword model. Compared with a baseline Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, a Transformer-optimized model demonstrated a BLEU score improvement of 7.8 points. When benchmarked against Google Translate, our translation engines demonstrated significant improvements. Furthermore, a quantitative fine-grained manual evaluation was conducted which compared the performance of machine translation systems. Using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) error taxonomy, a human evaluation of the error types generated by an RNN-based system and a Transformer-based system was explored. Our findings show the best-performing Transformer system significantly reduces both accuracy and fluency errors when compared with an RNN-based model.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02368">A Novel Hybrid Feature Importance and Feature Interaction Detection Framework for Predictive Optimization in Industry 4.0 Applications</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Ma, Bo N{\o}rregaard J{\o}rgensen, Zheng Grace Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced machine learning algorithms are increasingly utilized to provide data-based prediction and decision-making support in Industry 4.0. However, the prediction accuracy achieved by the existing models is insufficient to warrant practical implementation in real-world applications. This is because not all features present in real-world datasets possess a direct relevance to the predictive analysis being conducted. Consequently, the careful incorporation of select features has the potential to yield a substantial positive impact on the outcome. To address the research gap, this paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that combines the feature importance detector - local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and the feature interaction detector - neural interaction detection (NID), to improve prediction accuracy. By applying the proposed framework, unnecessary features can be eliminated, and interactions are encoded to generate a more conducive dataset for predictive purposes. Subsequently, the proposed model is deployed to refine the prediction of electricity consumption in foundry processing. The experimental outcomes reveal an augmentation of up to 9.56% in the R2 score, and a diminution of up to 24.05% in the root mean square error.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02370">adaptMLLM: Fine-Tuning Multilingual Language Models on Low-Resource Languages with Integrated LLM Playgrounds</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> S\'eamus Lankford, Haithem Afli, Andy Way</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Multilingual Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models has spawned innovation in many areas of natural language processing. Despite the exciting potential of this technology, its impact on developing high-quality Machine Translation (MT) outputs for low-resource languages remains relatively under-explored. Furthermore, an open-source application, dedicated to both fine-tuning MLLMs and managing the complete MT workflow for low-resources languages, remains unavailable. We aim to address these imbalances through the development of adaptMLLM, which streamlines all processes involved in the fine-tuning of MLLMs for MT. This open-source application is tailored for developers, translators, and users who are engaged in MT. An intuitive interface allows for easy customisation of hyperparameters, and the application offers a range of metrics for model evaluation and the capability to deploy models as a translation service directly within the application. As a multilingual tool, we used adaptMLLM to fine-tune models for two low-resource language pairs: English to Irish (EN$\leftrightarrow$GA) and English to Marathi (EN$\leftrightarrow$MR). Compared with baselines from the LoResMT2021 Shared Task, the adaptMLLM system demonstrated significant improvements. In the EN$\rightarrow$GA direction, an improvement of 5.2 BLEU points was observed and an increase of 40.5 BLEU points was recorded in the GA$\rightarrow$EN direction. Significant improvements in the translation performance of the EN$\leftrightarrow$MR pair were also observed notably in the MR$\rightarrow$EN direction with an increase of 21.3 BLEU points. Finally, a fine-grained human evaluation of the MLLM output on the EN$\rightarrow$GA pair was conducted using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics and Scalar Quality Metrics error taxonomies.

<p>Abstract: The advancement of Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis through speech analysis is hindered by a notable lack of publicly available, diverse language datasets, limiting the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research.
  In response to this gap, we introduce a comprehensive corpus from 108 native Castilian Spanish speakers, comprising 55 healthy controls and 53 individuals diagnosed with PD, all of whom were under pharmacological treatment and recorded in their medication-optimized state. This unique dataset features a wide array of speech tasks, including sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels, diadochokinetic tests, 16 listen-and-repeat utterances, and free monologues. The dataset emphasizes accuracy and reliability through specialist manual transcriptions of the listen-and-repeat tasks and utilizes Whisper for automated monologue transcriptions, making it the most complete public corpus of Parkinsonian speech, and the first in Castillian Spanish.
  NeuroVoz is composed by 2,903 audio recordings averaging $26.88 \pm 3.35$ recordings per participant, offering a substantial resource for the scientific exploration of PD's impact on speech. This dataset has already underpinned several studies, achieving a benchmark accuracy of 89% in PD speech pattern identification, indicating marked speech alterations attributable to PD. Despite these advances, the broader challenge of conducting a language-agnostic, cross-corpora analysis of Parkinsonian speech patterns remains an open area for future research. This contribution not only fills a critical void in PD speech analysis resources but also sets a new standard for the global research community in leveraging speech as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02372">OTClean: Data Cleaning for Conditional Independence Violations using Optimal Transport</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Pirhadi, Mohammad Hossein Moslemi, Alexander Cloninger, Mostafa Milani, Babak Salimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring Conditional Independence (CI) constraints is pivotal for the development of fair and trustworthy machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce \sys, a framework that harnesses optimal transport theory for data repair under CI constraints. Optimal transport theory provides a rigorous framework for measuring the discrepancy between probability distributions, thereby ensuring control over data utility. We formulate the data repair problem concerning CIs as a Quadratically Constrained Linear Program (QCLP) and propose an alternating method for its solution. However, this approach faces scalability issues due to the computational cost associated with computing optimal transport distances, such as the Wasserstein distance. To overcome these scalability challenges, we reframe our problem as a regularized optimization problem, enabling us to develop an iterative algorithm inspired by Sinkhorn's matrix scaling algorithm, which efficiently addresses high-dimensional and large-scale data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed methods, showcasing their practical utility in real-world data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. Furthermore, we provide comparisons with traditional approaches, highlighting the superiority of our techniques in terms of preserving data utility while ensuring adherence to the desired CI constraints.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02419">Are More LLM Calls All You Need? Towards Scaling Laws of Compound Inference Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingjiao Chen, Jared Quincy Davis, Boris Hanin, Peter Bailis, Ion Stoica, Matei Zaharia, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent state-of-the-art results in language tasks were achieved using compound systems that perform multiple Large Language Model (LLM) calls and aggregate their responses. However, there is little understanding of how the number of LLM calls -- e.g., when asking the LLM to answer each question multiple times and taking a consensus -- affects such a compound system's performance. In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling laws of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LLM calls affects the performance of one-layer Voting Inference Systems -- one of the simplest compound systems, which aggregates LLM responses via majority voting. We find empirically that across multiple language tasks, surprisingly, Voting Inference Systems' performance first increases but then decreases as a function of the number of LLM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LLM calls lead to higher performance on "easy" queries, but lower performance on "hard" queries, and non-monotone behavior emerges when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of LLM calls that maximizes system performance, and define a scaling law of Voting Inference Systems. Experiments show that our scaling law can predict the performance of Voting Inference Systems and find the optimal number of LLM calls to make.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02429">Towards efficient deep autoencoders for multivariate time series anomaly detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Pietro\'n, Dominik \.Zurek, Kamil Faber, Roberto Corizzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a crucial problem in many industrial and research applications. Timely detection of anomalies allows, for instance, to prevent defects in manufacturing processes and failures in cyberphysical systems. Deep learning methods are preferred among others for their accuracy and robustness for the analysis of complex multivariate data. However, a key aspect is being able to extract predictions in a timely manner, to accommodate real-time requirements in different applications. In the case of deep learning models, model reduction is extremely important to achieve optimal results in real-time systems with limited time and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel compression method for deep autoencoders that involves three key factors. First, pruning reduces the number of weights, while preventing catastrophic drops in accuracy by means of a fast search process that identifies high sparsity levels. Second, linear and non-linear quantization reduces model complexity by reducing the number of bits for every single weight. The combined contribution of these three aspects allow the model size to be reduced, by removing a subset of the weights (pruning), and decreasing their bit-width (quantization). As a result, the compressed model is faster and easier to adopt in highly constrained hardware environments. Experiments performed on popular multivariate anomaly detection benchmarks, show that our method is capable of achieving significant model compression ratio (between 80% and 95%) without a significant reduction in the anomaly detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyejun Jeong, Shiqing Ma, Amir Houmansadr</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL), introduced in 2017, facilitates collaborative learning between non-trusting parties with no need for the parties to explicitly share their data among themselves. This allows training models on user data while respecting privacy regulations such as GDPR and CPRA. However, emerging privacy requirements may mandate model owners to be able to \emph{forget} some learned data, e.g., when requested by data owners or law enforcement. This has given birth to an active field of research called \emph{machine unlearning}. In the context of FL, many techniques developed for unlearning in centralized settings are not trivially applicable! This is due to the unique differences between centralized and distributed learning, in particular, interactivity, stochasticity, heterogeneity, and limited accessibility in FL. In response, a recent line of work has focused on developing unlearning mechanisms tailored to FL.
  This SoK paper aims to take a deep look at the \emph{federated unlearning} literature, with the goal of identifying research trends and challenges in this emerging field. By carefully categorizing papers published on FL unlearning (since 2020), we aim to pinpoint the unique complexities of federated unlearning, highlighting limitations on directly applying centralized unlearning methods. We compare existing federated unlearning methods regarding influence removal and performance recovery, compare their threat models and assumptions, and discuss their implications and limitations. For instance, we analyze the experimental setup of FL unlearning studies from various perspectives, including data heterogeneity and its simulation, the datasets used for demonstration, and evaluation metrics. Our work aims to offer insights and suggestions for future research on federated unlearning.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02439">Root Causing Prediction Anomalies Using Explainable AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramanathan Vishnampet, Rajesh Shenoy, Jianhui Chen, Anuj Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of explainable AI (XAI) for root-causing performance degradation in machine learning models that learn continuously from user engagement data. In such systems a single feature corruption can cause cascading feature, label and concept drifts. We have successfully applied this technique to improve the reliability of models used in personalized advertising. Performance degradation in such systems manifest as prediction anomalies in the models. These models are typically trained continuously using features that are produced by hundreds of real time data processing pipelines or derived from other upstream models. A failure in any of these pipelines or an instability in any of the upstream models can cause feature corruption, causing the model's predicted output to deviate from the actual output and the training data to become corrupted. The causal relationship between the features and the predicted output is complex, and root-causing is challenging due to the scale and dynamism of the system. We demonstrate how temporal shifts in the global feature importance distribution can effectively isolate the cause of a prediction anomaly, with better recall than model-to-feature correlation methods. The technique appears to be effective even when approximating the local feature importance using a simple perturbation-based method, and aggregating over a few thousand examples. We have found this technique to be a model-agnostic, cheap and effective way to monitor complex data pipelines in production and have deployed a system for continuously analyzing the global feature importance distribution of continuously trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camilo Calixto, Camilo Jaimes, Matheus D. Soldatelli, Simon K. Warfield, Ali Gholipour, Davood Karimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is increasingly used to study the fetal brain in utero. An important computation enabled by dMRI is streamline tractography, which has unique applications such as tract-specific analysis of the brain white matter and structural connectivity assessment. However, due to the low fetal dMRI data quality and the challenging nature of tractography, existing methods tend to produce highly inaccurate results. They generate many false streamlines while failing to reconstruct streamlines that constitute the major white matter tracts. In this paper, we advocate for anatomically constrained tractography based on an accurate segmentation of the fetal brain tissue directly in the dMRI space. We develop a deep learning method to compute the segmentation automatically. Experiments on independent test data show that this method can accurately segment the fetal brain tissue and drastically improve tractography results. It enables the reconstruction of highly curved tracts such as optic radiations. Importantly, our method infers the tissue segmentation and streamline propagation direction from a diffusion tensor fit to the dMRI data, making it applicable to routine fetal dMRI scans. The proposed method can lead to significant improvements in the accuracy and reproducibility of quantitative assessment of the fetal brain with dMRI.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02484">Encodings for Prediction-based Neural Architecture Search</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Akhauri, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictor-based methods have substantially enhanced Neural Architecture Search (NAS) optimization. The efficacy of these predictors is largely influenced by the method of encoding neural network architectures. While traditional encodings used an adjacency matrix describing the graph structure of a neural network, novel encodings embrace a variety of approaches from unsupervised pretraining of latent representations to vectors of zero-cost proxies. In this paper, we categorize and investigate neural encodings from three main types: structural, learned, and score-based. Furthermore, we extend these encodings and introduce \textit{unified encodings}, that extend NAS predictors to multiple search spaces. Our analysis draws from experiments conducted on over 1.5 million neural network architectures on NAS spaces such as NASBench-101 (NB101), NB201, NB301, Network Design Spaces (NDS), and TransNASBench-101. Building on our study, we present our predictor \textbf{FLAN}: \textbf{Fl}ow \textbf{A}ttention for \textbf{N}AS. FLAN integrates critical insights on predictor design, transfer learning, and \textit{unified encodings} to enable more than an order of magnitude cost reduction for training NAS accuracy predictors.

<p>Abstract: The prevailing grasp prediction methods predominantly rely on offline learning, overlooking the dynamic grasp learning that occurs during real-time adaptation to novel picking scenarios. These scenarios may involve previously unseen objects, variations in camera perspectives, and bin configurations, among other factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, SSL-ConvSAC, that combines semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning for online grasp learning. By treating pixels with reward feedback as labeled data and others as unlabeled, it efficiently exploits unlabeled data to enhance learning. In addition, we address the imbalance between labeled and unlabeled data by proposing a contextual curriculum-based method. We ablate the proposed approach on real-world evaluation data and demonstrate promise for improving online grasp learning on bin picking tasks using a physical 7-DoF Franka Emika robot arm with a suction gripper.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02502">Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Song, Da Yin, Xiang Yue, Jie Huang, Sujian Li, Bill Yuchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The pretrain-finetune paradigm represents a transformative approach in natural language processing (NLP). This paradigm distinguishes itself through the use of large pretrained language models, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in finetuning tasks, even with limited training data. This efficiency is especially beneficial for research in social sciences, where the number of annotated samples is often quite limited. Our tutorial offers a comprehensive introduction to the pretrain-finetune paradigm. We first delve into the fundamental concepts of pretraining and finetuning, followed by practical exercises using real-world applications. We demonstrate the application of the paradigm across various tasks, including multi-class classification and regression. Emphasizing its efficacy and user-friendliness, the tutorial aims to encourage broader adoption of this paradigm. To this end, we have provided open access to all our code and datasets. The tutorial is particularly valuable for quantitative researchers in psychology, offering them an insightful guide into this innovative approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Gao, Jiaxin Zhang, Lalla Mouatadid, Kamalika Das</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent, offering remarkable text generation capabilities. However, a pressing challenge is their tendency to make confidently wrong predictions, highlighting the critical need for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in LLMs. While previous works have mainly focused on addressing aleatoric uncertainty, the full spectrum of uncertainties, including epistemic, remains inadequately explored. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a novel UQ method, sampling with perturbation for UQ (SPUQ), designed to tackle both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The method entails generating a set of perturbations for LLM inputs, sampling outputs for each perturbation, and incorporating an aggregation module that generalizes the sampling uncertainty approach for text generation tasks. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we investigated different perturbation and aggregation techniques. Our findings show a substantial improvement in model uncertainty calibration, with a reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 50\% on average. Our findings suggest that our proposed UQ method offers promising steps toward enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02514">Purpose for Open-Ended Learning Robots: A Computational Taxonomy, Definition, and Operationalisation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Baldassarre, Richard J. Duro, Emilio Cartoni, Mehdi Khamassi, Alejandro Romero, Vieri Giuliano Santucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous open-ended learning (OEL) robots are able to cumulatively acquire new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with the environment, for example relying on the guidance of intrinsic motivations and self-generated goals. OEL robots have a high relevance for applications as they can use the autonomously acquired knowledge to accomplish tasks relevant for their human users. OEL robots, however, encounter an important limitation: this may lead to the acquisition of knowledge that is not so much relevant to accomplish the users' tasks. This work analyses a possible solution to this problem that pivots on the novel concept of `purpose'. Purposes indicate what the designers and/or users want from the robot. The robot should use internal representations of purposes, called here `desires', to focus its open-ended exploration towards the acquisition of knowledge relevant to accomplish them. This work contributes to develop a computational framework on purpose in two ways. First, it formalises a framework on purpose based on a three-level motivational hierarchy involving: (a) the purposes; (b) the desires, which are domain independent; (c) specific domain dependent state-goals. Second, the work highlights key challenges highlighted by the framework such as: the `purpose-desire alignment problem', the `purpose-goal grounding problem', and the `arbitration between desires'. Overall, the approach enables OEL robots to learn in an autonomous way but also to focus on acquiring goals and skills that meet the purposes of the designers and users.</p>

<p>Abstract: Health acoustic sounds such as coughs and breaths are known to contain useful health signals with significant potential for monitoring health and disease, yet are underexplored in the medical machine learning community. The existing deep learning systems for health acoustics are often narrowly trained and evaluated on a single task, which is limited by data and may hinder generalization to other tasks. To mitigate these gaps, we develop HeAR, a scalable self-supervised learning-based deep learning system using masked autoencoders trained on a large dataset of 313 million two-second long audio clips. Through linear probes, we establish HeAR as a state-of-the-art health audio embedding model on a benchmark of 33 health acoustic tasks across 6 datasets. By introducing this work, we hope to enable and accelerate further health acoustics research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueqing Wu, Rui Zheng, Jingzhen Sha, Te-Lin Wu, Hanyu Zhou, Mohan Tang, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng, Haoran Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data analysis is a crucial analytical process to generate in-depth studies and conclusive insights to comprehensively answer a given user query for tabular data. In this work, we aim to propose new resources and benchmarks to inspire future research on this crucial yet challenging and under-explored task. However, collecting data analysis annotations curated by experts can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to automatically generate high-quality answer annotations leveraging the code-generation capabilities of LLMs with a multi-turn prompting technique. We construct the DACO dataset, containing (1) 440 databases (of tabular data) collected from real-world scenarios, (2) ~2k query-answer pairs that can serve as weak supervision for model training, and (3) a concentrated but high-quality test set with human refined annotations that serves as our main evaluation benchmark. We train a 6B supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model on DACO dataset, and find that the SFT model learns reasonable data analysis capabilities. To further align the models with human preference, we use reinforcement learning to encourage generating analysis perceived by human as helpful, and design a set of dense rewards to propagate the sparse human preference reward to intermediate code generation steps. Our DACO-RL algorithm is evaluated by human annotators to produce more helpful answers than SFT model in 57.72% cases, validating the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

<p>Abstract: Scaling laws play an instrumental role in the sustainable improvement in model quality. Unfortunately, recommendation models to date do not exhibit such laws similar to those observed in the domain of large language models, due to the inefficiencies of their upscaling mechanisms. This limitation poses significant challenges in adapting these models to increasingly more complex real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective network architecture based purely on stacked factorization machines, and a synergistic upscaling strategy, collectively dubbed Wukong, to establish a scaling law in the domain of recommendation. Wukong's unique design makes it possible to capture diverse, any-order of interactions simply through taller and wider layers. We conducted extensive evaluations on six public datasets, and our results demonstrate that Wukong consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models quality-wise. Further, we assessed Wukong's scalability on an internal, large-scale dataset. The results show that Wukong retains its superiority in quality over state-of-the-art models, while holding the scaling law across two orders of magnitude in model complexity, extending beyond 100 Gflop or equivalently up to GPT-3/LLaMa-2 scale of total training compute, where prior arts fall short.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02567">Eliciting Better Multilingual Structured Reasoning from LLMs through Code</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Li, Tamer Alkhouli, Daniele Bonadiman, Nikolaos Pappas, Saab Mansour</p>
<p>Abstract: Development of large language models (LLM) have shown progress on reasoning, though studies have been limited to English or simple reasoning tasks. We thus introduce a multilingual structured reasoning and explanation dataset, termed xSTREET, that covers four tasks across six languages. xSTREET exposes a gap in base LLM performance between English and non-English reasoning tasks. We then propose two methods to remedy this gap, building on the insight that LLMs trained on code are better reasoners. First, at training time, we augment a code dataset with multi-lingual comments using machine translation while keeping program code as-is. Second, at inference time, we bridge the gap between training and inference by employing a prompt structure that incorporates step-by-step code primitives to derive new facts and find a solution. Our methods show improved multilingual performance on xSTREET, most notably on the scientific commonsense reasoning subtask. Furthermore, the models show no regression on non-reasoning tasks, thus showing our techniques maintain general-purpose abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Li, Lu Chen, Aiwei Liu, Kai Yu, Lijie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: The literature review is an indispensable step in the research process. It provides the benefit of comprehending the research problem and understanding the current research situation while conducting a comparative analysis of prior works. However, literature summary is challenging and time consuming. The previous LLM-based studies on literature review mainly focused on the complete process, including literature retrieval, screening, and summarization. However, for the summarization step, simple CoT method often lacks the ability to provide extensive comparative summary. In this work, we firstly focus on the independent literature summarization step and introduce ChatCite, an LLM agent with human workflow guidance for comparative literature summary. This agent, by mimicking the human workflow, first extracts key elements from relevant literature and then generates summaries using a Reflective Incremental Mechanism. In order to better evaluate the quality of the generated summaries, we devised a LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, in refer to the human evaluation criteria. The ChatCite agent outperformed other models in various dimensions in the experiments. The literature summaries generated by ChatCite can also be directly used for drafting literature reviews.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gradient-type distributed optimization methods have blossomed into one of the most important tools for solving a minimization learning task over a networked agent system. However, only one gradient update per iteration is difficult to achieve a substantive acceleration of convergence. In this paper, we propose an accelerated framework named as MUSIC allowing each agent to perform multiple local updates and a single combination in each iteration. More importantly, we equip inexact and exact distributed optimization methods into this framework, thereby developing two new algorithms that exhibit accelerated linear convergence and high communication efficiency. Our rigorous convergence analysis reveals the sources of steady-state errors arising from inexact policies and offers effective solutions. Numerical results based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate both our theoretical motivations and analysis, as well as performance advantages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online bidding and auction are crucial aspects of the online advertising industry. Conventionally, there is only one slot for ad display and most current studies focus on it. Nowadays, multi-slot display advertising is gradually becoming popular where many ads could be displayed in a list and shown as a whole to users. However, multi-slot display advertising leads to different cost-effectiveness. Advertisers have the incentive to adjust bid prices so as to win the most economical ad positions. In this study, we introduce bid shading into multi-slot display advertising for bid price adjustment with a Multi-task End-to-end Bid Shading(MEBS) method. We prove the optimality of our method theoretically and examine its performance experimentally. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, and we obtain a 7.01% lift in Gross Merchandise Volume, a 7.42% lift in Return on Investment, and a 3.26% lift in ad buy count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuelin Zhang, Pengyu Zheng, Wanquan Yan, Chengyu Fang, Shing Shin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Defocus blur is a persistent problem in microscope imaging that poses harm to pathology interpretation and medical intervention in cell microscopy and microscope surgery. To address this problem, a unified framework including multi-pyramid transformer (MPT) and extended frequency contrastive regularization (EFCR) is proposed to tackle two outstanding challenges in microscopy deblur: longer attention span and feature deficiency. The MPT employs an explicit pyramid structure at each network stage that integrates the cross-scale window attention (CSWA), the intra-scale channel attention (ISCA), and the feature-enhancing feed-forward network (FEFN) to capture long-range cross-scale spatial interaction and global channel context. The EFCR addresses the feature deficiency problem by exploring latent deblur signals from different frequency bands. It also enables deblur knowledge transfer to learn cross-domain information from extra data, improving deblur performance for labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments and downstream task validation show the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Project page: https://github.com/PieceZhang/MPT-CataBlur.</p>

Building on the decades of prior research on generative AI in games, many researchers have sped to investigate the power and potential of LLMs for games. Given the recent spike in LLM-related research in games, there is already a wealth of relevant research to survey. In order to capture a snapshot of the state of LLM research in games, and to help lay the foundation for future work, we carried out an initial scoping review of relevant papers published so far. In this paper, we review 76 papers published between 2022 to early 2024 on LLMs and video games, with key focus areas in game AI, game development, narrative, and game research and reviews. Our paper provides an early state of the field and lays the groundwork for future research and reviews on this topic.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02616">Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal State Estimation for Fine-grained Adaptive Anomaly Diagnosis of Industrial Cyber-physical Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haili Sun, Yan Huang, Lansheng Han, Cai Fu, Chunjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network attacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable and effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, existing researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among system working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution mechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association relationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS, this paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e. MAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer first constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the change patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better locate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the inter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently, based on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of series-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture the series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three associated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed to jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed by comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted comparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application domains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water treatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by ourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect fine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization performance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02624">Pareto-Optimal Estimation and Policy Learning on Short-term and Long-term Treatment Effects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingrong Wang, Anpeng Wu, Haoxuan Li, Weiming Liu, Qiaowei Miao, Ruoxuan Xiong, Fei Wu, Kun Kuang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on developing Pareto-optimal estimation and policy learning to identify the most effective treatment that maximizes the total reward from both short-term and long-term effects, which might conflict with each other. For example, a higher dosage of medication might increase the speed of a patient's recovery (short-term) but could also result in severe long-term side effects. Although recent works have investigated the problems about short-term or long-term effects or the both, how to trade-off between them to achieve optimal treatment remains an open challenge. Moreover, when multiple objectives are directly estimated using conventional causal representation learning, the optimization directions among various tasks can conflict as well. In this paper, we systematically investigate these issues and introduce a Pareto-Efficient algorithm, comprising Pareto-Optimal Estimation (POE) and Pareto-Optimal Policy Learning (POPL), to tackle them. POE incorporates a continuous Pareto module with representation balancing, enhancing estimation efficiency across multiple tasks. As for POPL, it involves deriving short-term and long-term outcomes linked with various treatment levels, facilitating an exploration of the Pareto frontier emanating from these outcomes. Results on both the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of stock earnings forecasting has received considerable attention due to the demand investors in real-world scenarios. However, compared with financial institutions, it is not easy for ordinary investors to mine factors and analyze news. On the other hand, although large language models in the financial field can serve users in the form of dialogue robots, it still requires users to have financial knowledge to ask reasonable questions. To serve the user experience, we aim to build an automatic system, FinReport, for ordinary investors to collect information, analyze it, and generate reports after summarizing.
  Specifically, our FinReport is based on financial news announcements and a multi-factor model to ensure the professionalism of the report. The FinReport consists of three modules: news factorization module, return forecasting module, risk assessment module. The news factorization module involves understanding news information and combining it with stock factors, the return forecasting module aim to analysis the impact of news on market sentiment, and the risk assessment module is adopted to control investment risk. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have well verified the effectiveness and explainability of our proposed FinReport.

<p>Abstract: Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of $O \left(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}} \right)$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Xu, Shashank Jere, Yifei Song, Yi-Hung Kao, Lizhong Zheng, Lingjia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the air interface has been envisioned as a key technology for next-generation (NextG) cellular networks. At the air interface, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and its variants such as multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) and massive/full-dimension MIMO have been key enablers across successive generations of cellular networks with evolving complexity and design challenges. Initiating active investigation into leveraging AI/ML tools to address these challenges for MIMO becomes a critical step towards an AI-enabled NextG air interface. At the NextG air interface, the underlying wireless environment will be extremely dynamic with operation adaptations performed on a sub-millisecond basis by MIMO operations such as MU-MIMO scheduling and rank/link adaptation. Given the enormously large number of operation adaptation possibilities, we contend that online real-time AI/ML-based approaches constitute a promising paradigm. To this end, we outline the inherent challenges and offer insights into the design of such online real-time AI/ML-based solutions for MIMO operations. An online real-time AI/ML-based method for MIMO-OFDM channel estimation is then presented, serving as a potential roadmap for developing similar techniques across various MIMO operations in NextG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Khan, Chollakorn Nimpattanavong, Thai Van Nguyen, Kantinan Plupattanakit, Ruck Thawonmas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new and improved DareFightingICE platform, a fighting game platform with a focus on visually impaired players (VIPs), in the Unity game engine. It also introduces the separation of the DareFightingICE Competition into two standalone competitions called DareFightingICE Sound Design Competition and DareFightingICE AI Competition--at the 2024 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)--in which a new platform will be used. This new platform is an enhanced version of the old DareFightingICE platform, having a better audio system to convey 3D sound and a better way to send audio data to AI agents. With this enhancement and by utilizing Unity, the new DareFightingICE platform is more accessible in terms of adding new features for VIPs and future audio research. This paper also improves the evaluation method for evaluating sound designs in the Sound Design Competition which will ensure a better sound design for VIPs as this competition continues to run at future CoG. To the best of our knowledge, both of our competitions are first of their kind, and the connection between the competitions to mutually improve the entries' quality with time makes these competitions an important part of representing an often overlooked segment within the broader gaming community, VIPs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02688">DOCTOR: Dynamic On-Chip Remediation Against Temporally-Drifting Thermal Variations Toward Self-Corrected Photonic Tensor Accelerators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Lu, Sanmitra Banerjee, Jiaqi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution for accelerating computation-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, offering unparalleled speed and energy efficiency, especially in resource-limited, latency-sensitive edge computing environments. However, the deployment of analog photonic tensor accelerators encounters reliability challenges due to hardware noises and environmental variations. While off-chip noise-aware training and on-chip training have been proposed to enhance the variation tolerance of optical neural accelerators with moderate, static noises, we observe a notable performance degradation over time due to temporally drifting variations, which requires a real-time, in-situ calibration mechanism. To tackle this challenging reliability issues, for the first time, we propose a lightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework, dubbed DOCTOR, providing adaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noises. The DOCTOR framework intelligently monitors the chip status using adaptive probing and performs fast in-situ training-free calibration to restore accuracy when necessary. Recognizing nonuniform spatial variation distributions across devices and tensor cores, we also propose a variation-aware architectural remapping strategy to avoid executing critical tasks on noisy devices. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework can guarantee sustained performance under drifting variations with 34% higher accuracy and 2-3 orders-of-magnitude lower overhead compared to state-of-the-art on-chip training methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694">Privacy-Aware Semantic Cache for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Waris GillVirginia Tech, USA, Mohamed ElidrisiCisco, USA, Pallavi KalapatapuCisco, USA, Ali AnwarUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA, Muhammad Ali GulzarVirginia Tech, USA</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Google Bard, Claude, and Llama 2 have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters and inference on these models also demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates.
  This paper introduces MeanCache, a semantic cache for LLMs that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model in a distributed manner across numerous users without violating privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower cache false hit rates. Our experiments, benchmarked against the GPTCache, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions. Furthermore, MeanCache reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%, while still surpassing GPTCache.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang T. Truong, Duc Q. Nguyen, Toan Nguyen, Dong D. Le, Nhi N. Truong, Tho Quan, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their importance in the evolution of artificial intelligence. However, despite extensive pretraining on multilingual datasets, available open-sourced LLMs exhibit limited effectiveness in processing Vietnamese. The challenge is exacerbated by the absence of systematic benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for Vietnamese LLM evaluation. To mitigate these issues, we have finetuned LLMs specifically for Vietnamese and developed a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing 10 common tasks and 31 metrics. Our evaluation results reveal that the fine-tuned LLMs exhibit enhanced comprehension and generative capabilities in Vietnamese. Moreover, our analysis indicates that models with more parameters can introduce more biases and uncalibrated outputs and the key factor influencing LLM performance is the quality of the training or fine-tuning datasets. These insights underscore the significance of meticulous fine-tuning with high-quality datasets in enhancing LLM performance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02726">Bias in Generative AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mi Zhou, Vibhanshu Abhishek, Timothy Derdenger, Jaymo Kim, Kannan Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study analyzed images generated by three popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALLE 2 - representing various occupations to investigate potential bias in AI generators. Our analysis revealed two overarching areas of concern in these AI generators, including (1) systematic gender and racial biases, and (2) subtle biases in facial expressions and appearances. Firstly, we found that all three AI generators exhibited bias against women and African Americans. Moreover, we found that the evident gender and racial biases uncovered in our analysis were even more pronounced than the status quo when compared to labor force statistics or Google images, intensifying the harmful biases we are actively striving to rectify in our society. Secondly, our study uncovered more nuanced prejudices in the portrayal of emotions and appearances. For example, women were depicted as younger with more smiles and happiness, while men were depicted as older with more neutral expressions and anger, posing a risk that generative AI models may unintentionally depict women as more submissive and less competent than men. Such nuanced biases, by their less overt nature, might be more problematic as they can permeate perceptions unconsciously and may be more difficult to rectify. Although the extent of bias varied depending on the model, the direction of bias remained consistent in both commercial and open-source AI generators. As these tools become commonplace, our study highlights the urgency to identify and mitigate various biases in generative AI, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring that AI technologies benefit all of humanity for a more inclusive future.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02727">HARGPT: Are LLMs Zero-Shot Human Activity Recognizers?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Ji, Xinzhe Zheng, Chenshu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: There is an ongoing debate regarding the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as foundational models seamlessly integrated with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for interpreting the physical world. In this paper, we carry out a case study to answer the following question: Are LLMs capable of zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR). Our study, HARGPT, presents an affirmative answer by demonstrating that LLMs can comprehend raw IMU data and perform HAR tasks in a zero-shot manner, with only appropriate prompts. HARGPT inputs raw IMU data into LLMs and utilizes the role-play and think step-by-step strategies for prompting. We benchmark HARGPT on GPT4 using two public datasets of different inter-class similarities and compare various baselines both based on traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep classification models. Remarkably, LLMs successfully recognize human activities from raw IMU data and consistently outperform all the baselines on both datasets. Our findings indicate that by effective prompting, LLMs can interpret raw IMU data based on their knowledge base, possessing a promising potential to analyze raw sensor data of the physical world effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rare object detection is a fundamental task in applied geospatial machine learning, however is often challenging due to large amounts of high-resolution satellite or aerial imagery and few or no labeled positive samples to start with. This paper addresses the problem of bootstrapping such a rare object detection task assuming there is no labeled data and no spatial prior over the area of interest. We propose novel offline and online cluster-based approaches for sampling patches that are significantly more efficient, in terms of exposing positive samples to a human annotator, than random sampling. We apply our methods for identifying bomas, or small enclosures for herd animals, in the Serengeti Mara region of Kenya and Tanzania. We demonstrate a significant enhancement in detection efficiency, achieving a positive sampling rate increase from 2% (random) to 30%. This advancement enables effective machine learning mapping even with minimal labeling budgets, exemplified by an F1 score on the boma detection task of 0.51 with a budget of 300 total patches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suraj Bhute, Subhamoy Mandal, Debashree Guha</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely used medical tool for non-invasive diagnosis, but its images often contain speckle noise which can lower their resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio. This can make it more difficult to extract, recognize, and analyze features in the images, as well as impair the accuracy of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques and the ability of doctors to interpret the images. Reducing speckle noise, therefore, is a crucial step in the preprocessing of ultrasound images. Researchers have proposed several speckle reduction methods, but no single method takes all relevant factors into account. In this paper, we compare seven such methods: Median, Gaussian, Bilateral, Average, Weiner, Anisotropic and Denoising auto-encoder without and with skip connections in terms of their ability to preserve features and edges while effectively reducing noise. In an experimental study, a convolutional noise-removing auto-encoder with skip connection, a deep learning method, was used to improve ultrasound images of breast cancer. This method involved adding speckle noise at various levels. The results of the deep learning method were compared to those of traditional image enhancement methods, and it was found that the proposed method was more effective. To assess the performance of these algorithms, we use three established evaluation metrics and present both filtered images and statistical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Karlov, Ali Abedi, Shehroz S. Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs have proven to be effective in enhancing the quality of life and reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates. AI-driven virtual rehabilitation, which allows patients to independently complete exercises at home, utilizes AI algorithms to analyze exercise data, providing feedback to patients and updating clinicians on their progress. These programs commonly prescribe a variety of exercise types, leading to a distinct challenge in rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets: while abundant in overall training samples, these datasets often have a limited number of samples for each individual exercise type. This disparity hampers the ability of existing approaches to train generalizable models with such a small sample size per exercise. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces a novel supervised contrastive learning framework with hard and soft negative samples that effectively utilizes the entire dataset to train a single model applicable to all exercise types. This model, with a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture, demonstrated enhanced generalizability across exercises and a decrease in overall complexity. Through extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets, the University of Idaho-Physical Rehabilitation Movement Data (UI-PRMD), IntelliRehabDS (IRDS), and KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE), our method has shown to surpass existing methods, setting a new benchmark in rehabilitation exercise assessment accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YaoDan Zhang, Zidong Wang, Ru Jia, Ru Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, personalized recommendation technology has flourished and become one of the hot research directions. The matrix factorization model and the metric learning model which proposed successively have been widely studied and applied. The latter uses the Euclidean distance instead of the dot product used by the former to measure the latent space vector. While avoiding the shortcomings of the dot product, the assumption of Euclidean distance is neglected, resulting in limited recommendation quality of the model. In order to solve this problem, this paper combines the Variationl Information Bottleneck with metric learning model for the first time, and proposes a new metric learning model VIB-DML (Variational Information Bottleneck Distance Metric Learning) for rating prediction, which limits the mutual information of the latent space feature vector to improve the robustness of the model and satisfiy the assumption of Euclidean distance by decoupling the latent space feature vector. In this paper, the experimental results are compared with the root mean square error (RMSE) on the three public datasets. The results show that the generalization ability of VIB-DML is excellent. Compared with the general metric learning model MetricF, the prediction error is reduced by 7.29%. Finally, the paper proves the strong robustness of VIBDML through experiments.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02799">DPPA: Pruning Method for Large Language Model to Model Merging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaochen Zhu, Rui Xia, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging is to combine fine-tuned models derived from multiple domains, with the intent of enhancing the model's proficiency across various domains. The principal concern is the resolution of parameter conflicts. A substantial amount of existing research remedy this issue during the merging stage, with the latest study focusing on resolving this issue throughout the pruning stage. The DARE approach has exhibited promising outcomes when applied to a simplistic fine-tuned model. However, the efficacy of this method tends to wane when employed on complex fine-tuned models that show a significant parameter bias relative to the baseline model. In this paper, we introduce a dual-stage method termed Dynamic Pruning Partition Amplification (DPPA), devised to tackle the challenge of merging complex fine-tuned models. Initially, we introduce Dynamically Pruning (DP), an improved approach based on magnitude pruning, which aim is to enhance performance at higher pruning rates. Subsequently, we propose Dynamically Partition Amplification (DPA), a rescaling strategy, is designed to dynamically amplify parameter partitions in relation to their significance levels. The experimental results show that our method maintains a mere 20% of domain-specific parameters and yet delivers a performance comparable to other methodologies that preserve up to 90% of parameters. Furthermore, our method displays outstanding performance post-pruning, leading to a significant improvement of nearly 20% performance in model merging. We make our code on Github.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02810">Dynamic Gaussian Graph Operator: Learning parametric partial differential equations in arbitrary discrete mechanics problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chu Wang, Jinhong Wu, Yanzhi Wang, Zhijian Zha, Qi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods have access to be employed for solving physical systems governed by parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) due to massive scientific data. It has been refined to operator learning that focuses on learning non-linear mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces, offering interface from observations to solutions. However, state-of-the-art neural operators are limited to constant and uniform discretization, thereby leading to deficiency in generalization on arbitrary discretization schemes for computational domain. In this work, we propose a novel operator learning algorithm, referred to as Dynamic Gaussian Graph Operator (DGGO) that expands neural operators to learning parametric PDEs in arbitrary discrete mechanics problems. The Dynamic Gaussian Graph (DGG) kernel learns to map the observation vectors defined in general Euclidean space to metric vectors defined in high-dimensional uniform metric space. The DGG integral kernel is parameterized by Gaussian kernel weighted Riemann sum approximating and using dynamic message passing graph to depict the interrelation within the integral term. Fourier Neural Operator is selected to localize the metric vectors on spatial and frequency domains. Metric vectors are regarded as located on latent uniform domain, wherein spatial and spectral transformation offer highly regular constraints on solution space. The efficiency and robustness of DGGO are validated by applying it to solve numerical arbitrary discrete mechanics problems in comparison with mainstream neural operators. Ablation experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of spatial transformation in the DGG kernel. The proposed method is utilized to forecast stress field of hyper-elastic material with geometrically variable void as engineering application.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02814">InjectTST: A Transformer Method of Injecting Global Information into Independent Channels for Long Time Series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Chi, Xing Wang, Kexin Yang, Zhiyan Song, Di Jin, Lin Zhu, Chao Deng, Junlan Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer has become one of the most popular architectures for multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Recent Transformer-based MTS models generally prefer channel-independent structures with the observation that channel independence can alleviate noise and distribution drift issues, leading to more robustness. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that channel dependency remains an inherent characteristic of MTS, carrying valuable information. Designing a model that incorporates merits of both channel-independent and channel-mixing structures is a key to further improvement of MTS forecasting, which poses a challenging conundrum. To address the problem, an injection method for global information into channel-independent Transformer, InjectTST, is proposed in this paper. Instead of designing a channel-mixing model directly, we retain the channel-independent backbone and gradually inject global information into individual channels in a selective way. A channel identifier, a global mixing module and a self-contextual attention module are devised in InjectTST. The channel identifier can help Transformer distinguish channels for better representation. The global mixing module produces cross-channel global information. Through the self-contextual attention module, the independent channels can selectively concentrate on useful global information without robustness degradation, and channel mixing is achieved implicitly. Experiments indicate that InjectTST can achieve stable improvement compared with state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younghan Lee, Yungi Cho, Woorim Han, Ho Bae, Yunheung Paek</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) thrives in training a global model with numerous clients by only sharing the parameters of their local models trained with their private training datasets. Therefore, without revealing the private dataset, the clients can obtain a deep learning (DL) model with high performance. However, recent research proposed poisoning attacks that cause a catastrophic loss in the accuracy of the global model when adversaries, posed as benign clients, are present in a group of clients. Therefore, recent studies suggested byzantine-robust FL methods that allow the server to train an accurate global model even with the adversaries present in the system. However, many existing methods require the knowledge of the number of malicious clients or the auxiliary (clean) dataset or the effectiveness reportedly decreased hugely when the private dataset was non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). In this work, we propose FLGuard, a novel byzantine-robust FL method that detects malicious clients and discards malicious local updates by utilizing the contrastive learning technique, which showed a tremendous improvement as a self-supervised learning method. With contrastive models, we design FLGuard as an ensemble scheme to maximize the defensive capability. We evaluate FLGuard extensively under various poisoning attacks and compare the accuracy of the global model with existing byzantine-robust FL methods. FLGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods in most cases and shows drastic improvement, especially in non-IID settings. https://github.com/201younghanlee/FLGuard</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Lu, Xiaosong Jia, Yichen Xie, Wenlong Liao, Xiaokang Yang, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end differentiable learning for autonomous driving (AD) has recently become a prominent paradigm. One main bottleneck lies in its voracious appetite for high-quality labeled data e.g. 3D bounding boxes and semantic segmentation, which are notoriously expensive to manually annotate. The difficulty is further pronounced due to the prominent fact that the behaviors within samples in AD often suffer from long tailed distribution. In other words, a large part of collected data can be trivial (e.g. simply driving forward in a straight road) and only a few cases are safety-critical. In this paper, we explore a practically important yet under-explored problem about how to achieve sample and label efficiency for end-to-end AD. Specifically, we design a planning-oriented active learning method which progressively annotates part of collected raw data according to the proposed diversity and usefulness criteria for planning routes. Empirically, we show that our planning-oriented approach could outperform general active learning methods by a large margin. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art end-to-end AD methods - by using only 30% nuScenes data. We hope our work could inspire future works to explore end-to-end AD from a data-centric perspective in addition to methodology efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Tang, Xingxing Zhang, Benyou Wan, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in problem-solving. However, their proficiency in solving mathematical problems remains inadequate. We propose MathScale, a simple and scalable method to create high-quality mathematical reasoning data using frontier LLMs (e.g., {\tt GPT-3.5}). Inspired by the cognitive mechanism in human mathematical learning, it first extracts topics and knowledge points from seed math questions and then build a concept graph, which is subsequently used to generate new math questions. MathScale exhibits effective scalability along the size axis of the math dataset that we generate. As a result, we create a mathematical reasoning dataset (MathScaleQA) containing two million math question-answer pairs. To evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs comprehensively, we construct {\sc MwpBench}, a benchmark of Math Word Problems, which is a collection of ten datasets (including GSM8K and MATH) covering K-12, college, and competition level math problems. We apply MathScaleQA to fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2 and Mistral), resulting in significantly improved capabilities in mathematical reasoning. Evaluated on {\sc MwpBench}, MathScale-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets, surpassing its best peers of equivalent size by 42.9\% in micro average accuracy and 43.7\% in macro average accuracy, respectively.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02892">Enhancing Long-Term Person Re-Identification Using Global, Local Body Part, and Head Streams</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Duy Tran Thanh, Yeejin Lee, Byeongkeun Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the task of long-term person re-identification. Typically, person re-identification assumes that people do not change their clothes, which limits its applications to short-term scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we investigate long-term person re-identification, which considers both clothes-changing and clothes-consistent scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that effectively learns and utilizes both global and local information. The proposed framework consists of three streams: global, local body part, and head streams. The global and head streams encode identity-relevant information from an entire image and a cropped image of the head region, respectively. Both streams encode the most distinct, less distinct, and average features using the combinations of adversarial erasing, max pooling, and average pooling. The local body part stream extracts identity-related information for each body part, allowing it to be compared with the same body part from another image. Since body part annotations are not available in re-identification datasets, pseudo-labels are generated using clustering. These labels are then utilized to train a body part segmentation head in the local body part stream. The proposed framework is trained by backpropagating the weighted summation of the identity classification loss, the pair-based loss, and the pseudo body part segmentation loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three publicly available datasets (Celeb-reID, PRCC, and VC-Clothes). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02893">Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Document-Level Event Causality Identification with Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Transfer Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitao He, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Mengshu Sun, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) refers to detect causal relations between events in texts. However, most existing studies focus on sentence-level ECI with high-resource language, leaving more challenging document-level ECI (DECI) with low-resource languages under-explored. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Interaction Model with Multi-granularity Contrastive Transfer Learning (GIMC) for zero-shot cross-lingual document-level ECI. Specifically, we introduce a heterogeneous graph interaction network to model the long-distance dependencies between events that are scattered over document. Then, to improve cross-lingual transferability of causal knowledge learned from source language, we propose a multi-granularity contrastive transfer learning module to align the causal representations across languages. Extensive experiments show our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art model by 9.4% and 8.2% of average F1 score on monolingual and multilingual scenarios respectively. Notably, in multilingual scenario, our zero-shot framework even exceeds GPT-3.5 with few-shot learning by 24.3% in overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xijia Tao, Shuai Zhong, Lei Li, Qi Liu, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, the safety issues of their integration with a vision module, or vision language models (VLMs), remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreaking attack against VLMs, aiming to bypass their safety barrier when a user inputs harmful instructions. A scenario where our poisoned (image, text) data pairs are included in the training data is assumed. By replacing the original textual captions with malicious jailbreak prompts, our method can perform jailbreak attacks with the poisoned images. Moreover, we analyze the effect of poison ratios and positions of trainable parameters on our attack's success rate. For evaluation, we design two metrics to quantify the success rate and the stealthiness of our attack. Together with a list of curated harmful instructions, a benchmark for measuring attack efficacy is provided. We demonstrate the efficacy of our attack by comparing it with baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Sebastian Palacio, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism represents one of the biggest hurdles for processing long sequences using Transformers. Current methods, relying on sparse representations or stateful recurrence, sacrifice token-to-token interactions, which ultimately leads to compromises in performance. This paper introduces TaylorShift, a novel reformulation of the Taylor softmax that enables computing full token-to-token interactions in linear time and space. We analytically determine the crossover points where employing TaylorShift becomes more efficient than traditional attention, aligning closely with empirical measurements. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that TaylorShift enhances memory efficiency for sequences as short as 800 tokens and accelerates inference for inputs of approximately 1700 tokens and beyond. For shorter sequences, TaylorShift scales comparably with the vanilla attention. Furthermore, a classification benchmark across five tasks involving long sequences reveals no degradation in accuracy when employing Transformers equipped with TaylorShift. For reproducibility, we provide access to our code under https://github.com/tobna/TaylorShift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonjoo Lee, Hyeonsu B. Kang, Matt Latzke, Juho Kim, Jonathan Bragg, Joseph Chee Chang, Pao Siangliulue</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of scholarly archives, researchers subscribe to "paper alert" systems that periodically provide them with recommendations of recently published papers that are similar to previously collected papers. However, researchers sometimes struggle to make sense of nuanced connections between recommended papers and their own research context, as existing systems only present paper titles and abstracts. To help researchers spot these connections, we present PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alerts system that provides contextualized text descriptions of recommended papers based on user-collected papers. PaperWeaver employs a computational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer users' research interests from their collected papers, extract context-specific aspects of papers, and compare recommended and collected papers on these aspects. Our user study (N=15) showed that participants using PaperWeaver were able to better understand the relevance of recommended papers and triage them more confidently when compared to a baseline that presented the related work sections from recommended papers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool in advancing the Text-to-SQL task, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Nevertheless, as a nascent research field, there is still no consensus on the optimal prompt templates and design frameworks. Additionally, existing benchmarks inadequately explore the performance of LLMs across the various sub-tasks of the Text-to-SQL process, which hinders the assessment of LLMs' cognitive capabilities and the optimization of LLM-based solutions.To address the aforementioned issues, we firstly construct a new dataset designed to mitigate the risk of overfitting in LLMs. Then we formulate five evaluation tasks to comprehensively assess the performance of diverse methods across various LLMs throughout the Text-to-SQL process.Our study highlights the performance disparities among LLMs and proposes optimal in-context learning solutions tailored to each task. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing the development of LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of deep learning, natural language processing technology has effectively improved the efficiency of various aspects of the traditional judicial industry. However, most current efforts focus solely on individual judicial stage, overlooking cross-stage collaboration. As the autonomous agents powered by large language models are becoming increasingly smart and able to make complex decisions in real-world settings, offering new insights for judicial intelligence. In this paper, (1) we introduce SimuCourt, a judicial benchmark that encompasses 420 judgment documents from real-world, spanning the three most common types of judicial cases, and a novel task Judicial Decision-Making to evaluate the judicial analysis and decision-making power of agents. To support this task, we construct a large-scale judicial knowledge base, JudicialKB, with multiple legal knowledge. (2) we propose a novel multi-agent framework, AgentsCourt. Our framework follows the real-world classic court trial process, consisting of court debate simulation, legal information retrieval and judgement refinement to simulate the decision-making of judge. (3) we perform extensive experiments, the results demonstrate that, our framework outperforms the existing advanced methods in various aspects, especially in generating legal grounds, where our model achieves significant improvements of 8.6% and 9.1% F1 score in the first and second instance settings, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, for biometric tasks. We specifically examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in performing biometric-related tasks, with an emphasis on face recognition, gender detection, and age estimation. Since biometrics are considered as sensitive information, ChatGPT avoids answering direct prompts, and thus we crafted a prompting strategy to bypass its safeguard and evaluate the capabilities for biometrics tasks. Our study reveals that ChatGPT recognizes facial identities and differentiates between two facial images with considerable accuracy. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in gender detection and reasonable accuracy for the age estimation tasks. Our findings shed light on the promising potentials in the application of LLMs and foundation models for biometrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have investigated utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance Quesetion Answering (QA) performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet structured KG verbalization remains challengin. Existing methods, such as triple-form or free-form textual conversion of triple-form facts, encounter several issues.

To address these issues, we propose EFSum, an Evidence-focused Fact Summarization framework for enhanced QA with knowledge-augmented LLMs. We optimize an open-source LLM as a fact summarizer through distillation and preference alignment. Our extensive experiments show that EFSum improves LLM's zero-shot QA performance, and it is possible to ensure both the helpfulness and faithfulness of the summary.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Yao, Asaad Alghamdi, Qingrong Xia, Xiaoye Qu, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Yi Zheng, Baoxing Huai, Peilun Cheng, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentence semantic matching is a research hotspot in natural language processing, which is considerably significant in various key scenarios, such as community question answering, searching, chatbot, and recommendation. Since most of the advanced models directly model the semantic relevance among words between two sentences while neglecting the \textit{keywords} and \textit{intents} concepts of them, DC-Match is proposed to disentangle keywords from intents and utilizes them to optimize the matching performance. Although DC-Match is a simple yet effective method for semantic matching, it highly depends on the external NER techniques to identify the keywords of sentences, which limits the performance of semantic matching for minor languages since satisfactory NER tools are usually hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose to generally and flexibly resolve the text into multi concepts for multilingual semantic matching to liberate the model from the reliance on NER models. To this end, we devise a \underline{M}ulti-\underline{C}oncept \underline{P}arsed \underline{S}emantic \underline{M}atching framework based on the pre-trained language models, abbreviated as \textbf{MCP-SM}, to extract various concepts and infuse them into the classification tokens. We conduct comprehensive experiments on English datasets QQP and MRPC, and Chinese dataset Medical-SM. Besides, we experiment on Arabic datasets MQ2Q and XNLI, the outstanding performance further prove MCP-SM's applicability in low-resource languages.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02983">Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Nowroozi, Imran Haider, Rahim Taheri, Mauro Conti</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that enables multiple decentralized devices or edge servers to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data. During the training and sharing of model updates between clients and servers, data and models are susceptible to different data-poisoning attacks.
  In this study, our motivation is to explore the severity of data poisoning attacks in the computer network domain because they are easy to implement but difficult to detect. We considered two types of data-poisoning attacks, label flipping (LF) and feature poisoning (FP), and applied them with a novel approach. In LF, we randomly flipped the labels of benign data and trained the model on the manipulated data. For FP, we randomly manipulated the highly contributing features determined using the Random Forest algorithm. The datasets used in this experiment were CIC and UNSW related to computer networks. We generated adversarial samples using the two attacks mentioned above, which were applied to a small percentage of datasets. Subsequently, we trained and tested the accuracy of the model on adversarial datasets. We recorded the results for both benign and manipulated datasets and observed significant differences between the accuracy of the models on different datasets. From the experimental results, it is evident that the LF attack failed, whereas the FP attack showed effective results, which proved its significance in fooling a server. With a 1% LF attack on the CIC, the accuracy was approximately 0.0428 and the ASR was 0.9564; hence, the attack is easily detectable, while with a 1% FP attack, the accuracy and ASR were both approximately 0.9600, hence, FP attacks are difficult to detect. We repeated the experiment with different poisoning percentages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Nowroozi, Nada Jadalla, Samaneh Ghelichkhani, Alireza Jolfaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Malicious URLs provide adversarial opportunities across various industries, including transportation, healthcare, energy, and banking which could be detrimental to business operations. Consequently, the detection of these URLs is of crucial importance; however, current Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small percentage of training data labels, such as Label Flipping (LF), which changes benign labels to malicious ones and vice versa. This manipulation results in misclassification and leads to incorrect model behavior. Therefore, integrating defense mechanisms into the architecture of ML models becomes an imperative consideration to fortify against potential attacks.
  The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL detection using ensemble trees. By illuminating the motivations behind such attacks, highlighting the roles of attackers, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective defense strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to fortify ML models against adversarial threats within the ML domain in network security. We propose an innovative alarm system that detects the presence of poisoned labels and a defense mechanism designed to uncover the original class labels with the aim of mitigating backdoor attacks on ensemble tree classifiers. We conducted a case study using the Alexa and Phishing Site URL datasets and showed that LF attacks can be addressed using our proposed defense mechanism. Our experimental results prove that the LF attack achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) between 50-65% within 2-5%, and the innovative defense method successfully detected poisoned labels with an accuracy of up to 100%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The thesis investigates the utilization of memristive and memcapacitive crossbar arrays in low-power machine learning accelerators, offering a comprehensive co-design framework for deep neural networks (DNN). The model, implemented through a hybrid Python and PyTorch approach, accounts for various non-idealities, achieving exceptional training accuracies of 90.02% and 91.03% for the CIFAR-10 dataset with memristive and memcapacitive crossbar arrays on an 8-layer VGG network. Additionally, the thesis introduces a novel approach to emulate meminductor devices using Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTA) and capacitors, showcasing adjustable behavior. Transistor-level simulations in 180 nm CMOS technology, operating at 60 MHz, demonstrate the proposed meminductor emulator's viability with a power consumption of 0.337 mW. The design is further validated in neuromorphic circuits and CNN accelerators, achieving training and testing accuracies of 91.04% and 88.82%, respectively. Notably, the exclusive use of MOS transistors ensures the feasibility of monolithic IC fabrication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Beck, Matthew Jackson, Risto Vuorio, Zheng Xiong, Shimon Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: A core ambition of reinforcement learning (RL) is the creation of agents capable of rapid learning in novel tasks. Meta-RL aims to achieve this by directly learning such agents. One category of meta-RL methods, called black box methods, does so by training off-the-shelf sequence models end-to-end. In contrast, another category of methods have been developed that explicitly infer a posterior distribution over the unknown task. These methods generally have distinct objectives and sequence models designed to enable task inference, and so are known as task inference methods. However, recent evidence suggests that task inference objectives are unnecessary in practice. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether task inference sequence models are beneficial even when task inference objectives are not. In this paper, we present strong evidence that task inference sequence models are still beneficial. In particular, we investigate sequence models with permutation invariant aggregation, which exploit the fact that, due to the Markov property, the task posterior does not depend on the order of data. We empirically confirm the advantage of permutation invariant sequence models without the use of task inference objectives. However, we also find, surprisingly, that there are multiple conditions under which permutation variance remains useful. Therefore, we propose SplAgger, which uses both permutation variant and invariant components to achieve the best of both worlds, outperforming all baselines on continuous control and memory environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Zhiyong Sun, Siep Weiland</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper revisits a classical challenge in the design of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems with a norm-bounded input constraint. By extending Lin-Sontag's universal formula and introducing a generic (state-dependent) scaling term, a unifying controller design method is proposed. The incorporation of this generic scaling term gives a unified controller and enables the derivation of alternative universal formulas with various favorable properties, which makes it suitable for tailored control designs to meet specific requirements and provides versatility across different control scenarios. Additionally, we present a constructive approach to determine the optimal scaling term, leading to an explicit solution to an optimization problem, named optimization-based universal formula. The resulting controller ensures asymptotic stability, satisfies a norm-bounded input constraint, and optimizes a predefined cost function. Finally, the essential properties of the unified controllers are analyzed, including smoothness, continuity at the origin, stability margin, and inverse optimality. Simulations validate the approach, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing a challenging stabilizing control problem of a nonlinear system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan M. Dreifuerst, Robert W. Heath Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge for large antenna systems. Mobile systems like 5G use a beam management framework that joins the initial access, beamforming, CSI acquisition, and data transmission. The design of codebooks for these stages, however, is challenging due to their interrelationships, varying array sizes, and site-specific channel and user distributions. Furthermore, beam management is often focused on single-sector operations while ignoring the overarching network- and system-level optimization. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learned codebook design algorithm, network beamspace learning (NBL), that captures and optimizes codebooks to mitigate interference while maximizing the achievable performance with extremely large hybrid arrays. The proposed algorithm requires limited shared information yet designs codebooks that outperform traditional codebooks by over 10dB in beam alignment and achieve more than 25% improvements in network spectral efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haneol Kang, Dong-Wan Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma is a major challenge in continual learning, as it involves balancing the conflicting objectives of maintaining performance on previous tasks while learning new tasks. In this paper, we propose the recall-oriented continual learning framework to address this challenge. Inspired by the human brain's ability to separate the mechanisms responsible for stability and plasticity, our framework consists of a two-level architecture where an inference network effectively acquires new knowledge and a generative network recalls past knowledge when necessary. In particular, to maximize the stability of past knowledge, we investigate the complexity of knowledge depending on different representations, and thereby introducing generative adversarial meta-model (GAMM) that incrementally learns task-specific parameters instead of input data samples of the task. Through our experiments, we show that our framework not only effectively learns new knowledge without any disruption but also achieves high stability of previous knowledge in both task-aware and task-agnostic learning scenarios.

<p>Abstract: While recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have achieved significant progress, they still fall short in speech quality, similarity, and prosody. Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g., content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding prompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and efficiently model the intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a divide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and intelligibility. Furthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K hours of training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Zhu, Shuofei Qiao, Yixin Ou, Shumin Deng, Ningyu Zhang, Shiwei Lyu, Yue Shen, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03102">&quot;In Dialogues We Learn&quot;: Towards Personalized Dialogue Without Pre-defined Profiles through In-Dialogue Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanqi Cheng, Quan Tu, Wei Wu, Shuo Shang, Cunli Mao, Zhengtao Yu, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized dialogue systems have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate responses in alignment with different personas. However, most existing approaches rely on pre-defined personal profiles, which are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive to create but also lack flexibility. We propose In-Dialogue Learning (IDL), a fine-tuning framework that enhances the ability of pre-trained large language models to leverage dialogue history to characterize persona for completing personalized dialogue generation tasks without pre-defined profiles. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that IDL brings substantial improvements, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by up to 200% and 247%, respectively. Additionally, the results of human evaluations further validate the efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03111">Improved LiDAR Odometry and Mapping using Deep Semantic Segmentation and Novel Outliers Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Afifi, Mohamed ElHelw</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception is a key element for enabling intelligent autonomous navigation. Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03114">Equilibria in Two-Stage Facility Location with Atomic Clients</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Krogmann, Pascal Lenzner, Alexander Skopalik, Marc Uetz, Marnix C. Vos</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider competitive facility location as a two-stage multi-agent system with two types of clients. For a given host graph with weighted clients on the vertices, first facility agents strategically select vertices for opening their facilities. Then, the clients strategically select which of the opened facilities in their neighborhood to patronize. Facilities want to attract as much client weight as possible, clients want to minimize congestion on the chosen facility.
  All recently studied versions of this model assume that clients can split their weight strategically. We consider clients with unsplittable weights, but allow mixed strategies. So clients may randomize over which facility to patronize. Besides modeling a natural client behavior, this subtle change yields drastic changes, e.g., for a given facility placement, qualitatively different client equilibria are possible.
  As our main result, we show that pure subgame perfect equilibria always exist if all client weights are identical. For this, we use a novel potential function argument, employing a hierarchical classification of the clients and sophisticated rounding in each step. In contrast, for non-identical clients, we show that deciding the existence of even approximately stable states is computationally intractable. On the positive side, we give a tight bound of 2 on the price of anarchy which implies high social welfare of equilibria, if they exist.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03134">Simplicity in Complexity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Shen, Surabhi S Nath, Aenne Brielmann, Peter Dayan</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of visual stimuli plays an important role in many cognitive phenomena, including attention, engagement, memorability, time perception and aesthetic evaluation. Despite its importance, complexity is poorly understood and ironically, previous models of image complexity have been quite \textit{complex}. There have been many attempts to find handcrafted features that explain complexity, but these features are usually dataset specific, and hence fail to generalise. On the other hand, more recent work has employed deep neural networks to predict complexity, but these models remain difficult to interpret, and do not guide a theoretical understanding of the problem. Here we propose to model complexity using segment-based representations of images. We use state-of-the-art segmentation models, SAM and FC-CLIP, to quantify the number of segments at multiple granularities, and the number of classes in an image respectively. We find that complexity is well-explained by a simple linear model with these two features across six diverse image-sets of naturalistic scene and art images. This suggests that the complexity of images can be surprisingly simple.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haining Pan, Nayantara Mudur, Will Taranto, Maria Tikhanovskaya, Subhashini Venugopalan, Yasaman Bahri, Michael P. Brenner, Eun-Ah Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu, Cristian Rusu, Paul Irofti</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsifying transforms became in the last decades widely known tools for finding structured sparse representations of signals in certain transform domains. Despite the popularity of classical transforms such as DCT and Wavelet, learning optimal transforms that guarantee good representations of data into the sparse domain has been recently analyzed in a series of papers. Typically, the conditioning number and representation ability are complementary key features of learning square transforms that may not be explicitly controlled in a given optimization model. Unlike the existing approaches from the literature, in our paper, we consider a new sparsifying transform model that enforces explicit control over the data representation quality and the condition number of the learned transforms. We confirm through numerical experiments that our model presents better numerical behavior than the state-of-the-art.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03170">SNIFFER: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Qi, Zehong Yan, Wynne Hsu, Mong Li Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangchen Liu, Kuan Fang, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary generalization requires robotic systems to perform tasks involving complex and diverse environments and task goals. While the recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) present unprecedented opportunities to solve unseen problems, how to utilize their emergent capabilities to control robots in the physical world remains an open question. In this paper, we present MOKA (Marking Open-vocabulary Keypoint Affordances), an approach that employs VLMs to solve robotic manipulation tasks specified by free-form language descriptions. At the heart of our approach is a compact point-based representation of affordance and motion that bridges the VLM's predictions on RGB images and the robot's motions in the physical world. By prompting a VLM pre-trained on Internet-scale data, our approach predicts the affordances and generates the corresponding motions by leveraging the concept understanding and commonsense knowledge from broad sources. To scaffold the VLM's reasoning in zero-shot, we propose a visual prompting technique that annotates marks on the images, converting the prediction of keypoints and waypoints into a series of visual question answering problems that are feasible for the VLM to solve. Using the robot experiences collected in this way, we further investigate ways to bootstrap the performance through in-context learning and policy distillation. We evaluate and analyze MOKA's performance on a variety of manipulation tasks specified by free-form language descriptions, such as tool use, deformable body manipulation, and object rearrangement.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03181">Behavior Generation with Latent Actions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungjae Lee, Yibin Wang, Haritheja Etukuru, H. Jin Kim, Nur Muhammad Mahi Shafiullah, Lerrel Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been a longstanding problem in decision making. Unlike language or image generation, decision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are multimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources, where generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class of models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing actions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means struggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and lacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range actions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer (VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal action prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT augments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module. Across seven environments including simulated manipulation, autonomous driving, and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on state-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion Policies. Importantly, we demonstrate VQ-BeT's improved ability to capture behavior modes while accelerating inference speed 5x over Diffusion Policies. Videos and code can be found https://sjlee.cc/vq-bet</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angeliki Giannou, Liu Yang, Tianhao Wang, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning capabilities, prompting extensive research into its underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have suggested that Transformers can implement first-order optimization algorithms for in-context learning and even second order ones for the case of linear regression. In this work, we study whether Transformers can perform higher order optimization methods, beyond the case of linear regression. We establish that linear attention Transformers with ReLU layers can approximate second order optimization algorithms for the task of logistic regression and achieve $\epsilon$ error with only a logarithmic to the error more layers. As a by-product we demonstrate the ability of even linear attention-only Transformers in implementing a single step of Newton's iteration for matrix inversion with merely two layers. These results suggest the ability of the Transformer architecture to implement complex algorithms, beyond gradient descent.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03185">Preventing Reward Hacking with Occupancy Measure Regularization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassidy Laidlaw, Shivam Singhal, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward hacking occurs when an agent performs very well with respect to a "proxy" reward function (which may be hand-specified or learned), but poorly with respect to the unknown true reward. Since ensuring good alignment between the proxy and true reward is extremely difficult, one approach to prevent reward hacking is optimizing the proxy conservatively. Prior work has particularly focused on enforcing the learned policy to behave similarly to a "safe" policy by penalizing the KL divergence between their action distributions (AD). However, AD regularization doesn't always work well since a small change in action distribution at a single state can lead to potentially calamitous outcomes, while large changes might not be indicative of any dangerous activity. Our insight is that when reward hacking, the agent visits drastically different states from those reached by the safe policy, causing large deviations in state occupancy measure (OM). Thus, we propose regularizing based on the OM divergence between policies instead of AD divergence to prevent reward hacking. We theoretically establish that OM regularization can more effectively avoid large drops in true reward. Then, we empirically demonstrate in a variety of realistic environments that OM divergence is superior to AD divergence for preventing reward hacking by regularizing towards a safe policy. Furthermore, we show that occupancy measure divergence can also regularize learned policies away from reward hacking behavior.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akari Asai, Zexuan Zhong, Danqi Chen, Pang Wei Koh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Wen-tau Yih</p>
<p>Abstract: Parametric language models (LMs), which are trained on vast amounts of web data, exhibit remarkable flexibility and capability. However, they still face practical challenges such as hallucinations, difficulty in adapting to new data distributions, and a lack of verifiability. In this position paper, we advocate for retrieval-augmented LMs to replace parametric LMs as the next generation of LMs. By incorporating large-scale datastores during inference, retrieval-augmented LMs can be more reliable, adaptable, and attributable. Despite their potential, retrieval-augmented LMs have yet to be widely adopted due to several obstacles: specifically, current retrieval-augmented LMs struggle to leverage helpful text beyond knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering, have limited interaction between retrieval and LM components, and lack the infrastructure for scaling. To address these, we propose a roadmap for developing general-purpose retrieval-augmented LMs. This involves a reconsideration of datastores and retrievers, the exploration of pipelines with improved retriever-LM interaction, and significant investment in infrastructure for efficient training and inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. CUT reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that only a small portion of muscles are affected in motion disease and disorders, medical therapies do not distinguish between healthy and unhealthy muscles. In this paper, a method is devised in order to calculate the neural stimuli of the lower body during gait cycle and check if any group of muscles are not acting properly. For this reason, an agent-based model of human muscle is proposed. The agent is able to convert neural stimuli to force generated by the muscle and vice versa. It can be used in many researches including medical education and research and prosthesis development. Then, Boots algorithm is designed based on a biomechanical model of human lower body to do a reverse dynamics of human motion by computing the forces generated by each muscle group. Using the agent-driven model of human muscle and boots algorithm, a user-friendly application is developed which can calculate the number of neural stimuli received by each muscle during gait cycle. The application can be used by clinical experts to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy muscles.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12653">Partially Observable Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based on Graph-Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Yang, Guanjun Liu, Ziyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are difficultly applied in a large-scale multi-agent environment. The introduction of mean field theory has enhanced the scalability of multi-agent reinforcement learning in recent years. This paper considers partially observable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where each agent can only observe other agents within a fixed range. This partial observability affects the agent's ability to assess the quality of the actions of surrounding agents. This paper focuses on developing a method to capture more effective information from local observations in order to select more effective actions. Previous work in this field employs probability distributions or weighted mean field to update the average actions of neighborhood agents, but it does not fully consider the feature information of surrounding neighbors and leads to a local optimum. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, Partially Observable Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on Graph--Attention (GAMFQ) to remedy this flaw. GAMFQ uses a graph attention module and a mean field module to describe how an agent is influenced by the actions of other agents at each time step. This graph attention module consists of a graph attention encoder and a differentiable attention mechanism, and this mechanism outputs a dynamic graph to represent the effectiveness of neighborhood agents against central agents. The mean--field module approximates the effect of a neighborhood agent on a central agent as the average effect of effective neighborhood agents. We evaluate GAMFQ on three challenging tasks in the MAgents framework. Experiments show that GAMFQ outperforms baselines including the state-of-the-art partially observable mean-field reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Games have been the perfect test-beds for artificial intelligence research for the characteristics that widely exist in real-world scenarios. Learning and optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas shared between games and real-world problems. Numerous open-source games or game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and techniques. This paper reviews the game-based platforms for artificial intelligence research, provides guidance on matching particular types of artificial intelligence with suitable games for testing and matching particular needs in games with suitable artificial intelligence techniques, discusses the research trend induced by the evolution of those platforms, and gives an outlook.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit expert-level performance in tasks across a wide range of different domains. Ethical issues raised by LLMs and the need to align future versions makes it important to know how state of the art models reason about moral and legal issues. In this paper, we employ the methods of experimental psychology to probe into this question. We replicate eight studies from the experimental literature with instances of Google's Gemini Pro, Anthropic's Claude 2.1, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Meta's Llama 2 Chat 70b. We find that alignment with human responses shifts from one experiment to another, and that models differ amongst themselves as to their overall alignment, with GPT-4 taking a clear lead over all other models we tested. Nonetheless, even when LLM-generated responses are highly correlated to human responses, there are still systematic differences, with a tendency for models to exaggerate effects that are present among humans, in part by reducing variance. This recommends caution with regards to proposals of replacing human participants with current state-of-the-art LLMs in psychological research and highlights the need for further research about the distinctive aspects of machine psychology.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00194">A Prefrontal Cortex-inspired Architecture for Planning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Taylor Webb, Shanka Subhra Mondal, Chi Wang, Brian Krabach, Ida Momennejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. To address this, we take inspiration from the human brain, in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of specialized modules in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These modules perform functions such as conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and task coordination. We find that LLMs are sometimes capable of carrying out these functions in isolation, but struggle to autonomously coordinate them in the service of a goal. Therefore, we propose a black box architecture with multiple LLM-based (GPT-4) modules. The architecture improves planning through the interaction of specialized PFC-inspired modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate the combined architecture on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and logistics -- finding that it yields significant improvements over standard LLM methods (e.g., zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought). These results demonstrate the benefit of utilizing knowledge from cognitive neuroscience to improve planning in LLMs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13720">Can LLMs Fix Issues with Reasoning Models? Towards More Likely Models for AI Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Turgay Caglar, Sirine Belhaj, Tathagata Chakraborti, Michael Katz, Sarath Sreedharan</p>
<p>Abstract: This is the first work to look at the application of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of model space edits in automated planning tasks. To set the stage for this union, we explore two different flavors of model space problems that have been studied in the AI planning literature and explore the effect of an LLM on those tasks. We empirically demonstrate how the performance of an LLM contrasts with combinatorial search (CS) -- an approach that has been traditionally used to solve model space tasks in planning, both with the LLM in the role of a standalone model space reasoner as well as in the role of a statistical signal in concert with the CS approach as part of a two-stage process. Our experiments show promising results suggesting further forays of LLMs into the exciting world of model space reasoning for planning tasks in the future.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14058">Identification for Tree-shaped Structural Causal Models in Polynomial Time</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaryan Gupta, Markus Bl\"aser</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear structural causal models (SCMs) are used to express and analyse the relationships between random variables. Direct causal effects are represented as directed edges and confounding factors as bidirected edges. Identifying the causal parameters from correlations between the nodes is an open problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we study SCMs whose directed component forms a tree. Van der Zander et al. (AISTATS'22, PLMR 151, pp. 6770--6792, 2022) give a PSPACE-algorithm for the identification problem in this case, which is a significant improvement over the general Gr\"obner basis approach, which has doubly-exponential time complexity in the number of structural parameters. In this work, we present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm, which solves the identification problem for tree-shaped SCMs. For every structural parameter, our algorithms decides whether it is generically identifiable, generically 2-identifiable, or generically unidentifiable. (No other cases can occur.) In the first two cases, it provides one or two fractional affine square root terms of polynomials (FASTPs) for the corresponding parameter, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Lai, Zhao Xu, Weijia Zhang, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is a crucial component in urban traffic management, aiming to optimize road network efficiency and reduce congestion. Traditional methods in TSC, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often exhibit limitations in generalization across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments on nine real-world and synthetic datasets showcase the remarkable effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight against nine transportation-based and RL-based baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongye Xiao, Chenyu Zhou, Heng Ping, Defu Cao, Yaxing Li, Yizhuo Zhou, Shixuan Li, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior studies on the emergence in large models have primarily focused on how the functional capabilities of large language models (LLMs) scale with model size. Our research, however, transcends this traditional paradigm, aiming to deepen our understanding of the emergence within LLMs by placing a special emphasis not just on the model size but more significantly on the complex behavior of neuron interactions during the training process. By introducing the concepts of "self-organization" and "multifractal analysis," we explore how neuron interactions dynamically evolve during training, leading to "emergence," mirroring the phenomenon in natural systems where simple micro-level interactions give rise to complex macro-level behaviors. To quantitatively analyze the continuously evolving interactions among neurons in large models during training, we propose the Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA). Utilizing NeuroMFA, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the emergent behavior in LLMs through the lens of both model size and training process, paving new avenues for research into the emergence in large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Sacco, Loris Bozzato, Oliver Kutz</p>
<p>Abstract: Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning where some generalisations may not be valid in all circumstances, that is general conclusions may fail in some cases. Various formalisms have been developed to model this kind of reasoning, which is characteristic of common-sense contexts. However, it is not easy for a modeller to choose among these systems the one that better fits its domain from an ontological point of view. In this paper we first propose a framework based on the notions of exceptionality and defeasibility in order to be able to compare formalisms and reveal their ontological commitments. Then, we apply this framework to compare four systems, showing the differences that may occur from an ontological perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nova Spivack, Sam Douglas, Michelle Crames, Tim Connors</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies of the applications of conversational AI tools, such as chatbots powered by large language models, to complex real-world knowledge work have shown limitations related to reasoning and multi-step problem solving. Specifically, while existing chatbots simulate shallow reasoning and understanding they are prone to errors as problem complexity increases. The failure of these systems to address complex knowledge work is due to the fact that they do not perform any actual cognition. In this position paper, we present Cognitive AI, a higher-level framework for implementing programmatically defined neuro-symbolic cognition above and outside of large language models. Specifically, we propose a dual-layer functional architecture for Cognitive AI that serves as a roadmap for AI systems that can perform complex multi-step knowledge work. We propose that Cognitive AI is a necessary precursor for the evolution of higher forms of AI, such as AGI, and specifically claim that AGI cannot be achieved by probabilistic approaches on their own. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for large language models, adoption cycles in AI, and commercial Cognitive AI development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an upsurge in research interests and applications of machine learning on graphs. However, manually designing the optimal machine learning algorithms for different graph datasets and tasks is inflexible, labor-intensive, and requires expert knowledge, limiting its adaptivity and applicability. Automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs, aiming to automatically design the optimal machine learning algorithm for a given graph dataset and task, has received considerable attention. However, none of the existing libraries can fully support AutoML on graphs. To fill this gap, we present Automated Graph Learning (AutoGL), the first dedicated library for automated machine learning on graphs. AutoGL is open-source, easy to use, and flexible to be extended. Specifically, we propose a three-layer architecture, consisting of backends to interface with devices, a complete automated graph learning pipeline, and supported graph applications. The automated machine learning pipeline further contains five functional modules: auto feature engineering, neural architecture search, hyper-parameter optimization, model training, and auto ensemble, covering the majority of existing AutoML methods on graphs. For each module, we provide numerous state-of-the-art methods and flexible base classes and APIs, which allow easy usage and customization. We further provide experimental results to showcase the usage of our AutoGL library. We also present AutoGL-light, a lightweight version of AutoGL to facilitate customizing pipelines and enriching applications, as well as benchmarks for graph neural architecture search. The codes of AutoGL are publicly available at https://github.com/THUMNLab/AutoGL.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04376">Counterfactual Effect Generalization: A Combinatorial Definition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre F. Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The widely used 'Counterfactual' definition of Causal Effects was derived for unbiasedness and accuracy - and not generalizability. We propose a Combinatorial definition for the External Validity (EV) of intervention effects. We first define the concept of an effect observation 'background'. We then formulate conditions for effect generalization based on their sets of (observable and unobservable) backgrounds. This reveals two limits for effect generalization: (1) when effects are observed under all their enumerable backgrounds, or, (2) when backgrounds have become sufficiently randomized. We use the resulting combinatorial framework to re-examine several issues in the original counterfactual formulation: out-of-sample validity, concurrent estimation of multiple effects, bias-variance tradeoffs, statistical power, and connections to current predictive and explaining techniques.
  Methodologically, the definitions also allow us to also replace the parametric estimation problems that followed the counterfactual definition by combinatorial enumeration and randomization problems in non-experimental samples. We use this non-parametric framework to demonstrate (External Validity, Unconfoundness and Precision) tradeoffs in the performance of popular supervised, explaining, and causal-effect estimators. We demonstrate the approach also allows for the use of these methods in non-i.i.d. samples. The COVID19 pandemic highlighted the need for learning solutions to provide predictions in severally incomplete samples. We demonstrate applications in this pressing problem.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10657">Generalizing Graph Neural Networks on Out-Of-Distribution Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaohua Fan, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi, Peng Cui, Bai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed without considering the agnostic distribution shifts between training and testing graphs, inducing the degeneration of the generalization ability of GNNs on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings. The fundamental reason for such degeneration is that most GNNs are developed based on the I.I.D hypothesis. In such a setting, GNNs tend to exploit subtle statistical correlations existing in the training set for predictions, even though it is a spurious correlation. However, such spurious correlations may change in testing environments, leading to the failure of GNNs. Therefore, eliminating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial for stable GNNs. To this end, we propose a general causal representation framework, called StableGNN. The main idea is to extract high-level representations from graph data first and resort to the distinguishing ability of causal inference to help the model get rid of spurious correlations. Particularly, we exploit a graph pooling layer to extract subgraph-based representations as high-level representations. Furthermore, we propose a causal variable distinguishing regularizer to correct the biased training distribution. Hence, GNNs would concentrate more on the stable correlations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world OOD graph datasets well verify the effectiveness, flexibility and interpretability of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshitomo Matsubara, Naoya Chiba, Ryo Igarashi, Yoshitaka Ushiku</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper revisits datasets and evaluation criteria for Symbolic Regression (SR), specifically focused on its potential for scientific discovery. Focused on a set of formulas used in the existing datasets based on Feynman Lectures on Physics, we recreate 120 datasets to discuss the performance of symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD). For each of the 120 SRSD datasets, we carefully review the properties of the formula and its variables to design reasonably realistic sampling ranges of values so that our new SRSD datasets can be used for evaluating the potential of SRSD such as whether or not an SR method can (re)discover physical laws from such datasets. We also create another 120 datasets that contain dummy variables to examine whether SR methods can choose necessary variables only. Besides, we propose to use normalized edit distances (NED) between a predicted equation and the true equation trees for addressing a critical issue that existing SR metrics are either binary or errors between the target values and an SR model's predicted values for a given input. We conduct benchmark experiments on our new SRSD datasets using various representative SR methods. The experimental results show that we provide a more realistic performance evaluation, and our user study shows that the NED correlates with human judges significantly more than an existing SR metric. We publish repositories of our code and 240 SRSD datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Olko, Micha{\l} Zaj\k{a}c, Aleksandra Nowak, Nino Scherrer, Yashas Annadani, Stefan Bauer, {\L}ukasz Kuci\'nski, Piotr Mi{\l}o\'s</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring causal structure from data is a challenging task of fundamental importance in science. Observational data are often insufficient to identify a system's causal structure uniquely. While conducting interventions (i.e., experiments) can improve the identifiability, such samples are usually challenging and expensive to obtain. Hence, experimental design approaches for causal discovery aim to minimize the number of interventions by estimating the most informative intervention target. In this work, we propose a novel Gradient-based Intervention Targeting method, abbreviated GIT, that 'trusts' the gradient estimator of a gradient-based causal discovery framework to provide signals for the intervention acquisition function. We provide extensive experiments in simulated and real-world datasets and demonstrate that GIT performs on par with competitive baselines, surpassing them in the low-data regime.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17029">Directed Acyclic Graph Structure Learning from Dynamic Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaohua Fan, Shuyang Zhang, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of features (variables) plays a vital role in revealing the latent data generation process and providing causal insights in various applications. Although there have been many studies on structure learning with various types of data, the structure learning on the dynamic graph has not been explored yet, and thus we study the learning problem of node feature generation mechanism on such ubiquitous dynamic graph data. In a dynamic graph, we propose to simultaneously estimate contemporaneous relationships and time-lagged interaction relationships between the node features. These two kinds of relationships form a DAG, which could effectively characterize the feature generation process in a concise way. To learn such a DAG, we cast the learning problem as a continuous score-based optimization problem, which consists of a differentiable score function to measure the validity of the learned DAGs and a smooth acyclicity constraint to ensure the acyclicity of the learned DAGs. These two components are translated into an unconstraint augmented Lagrangian objective which could be minimized by mature continuous optimization techniques. The resulting algorithm, named GraphNOTEARS, outperforms baselines on simulated data across a wide range of settings that may encounter in real-world applications. We also apply the proposed approach on two dynamic graphs constructed from the real-world Yelp dataset, demonstrating our method could learn the connections between node features, which conforms with the domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Vincent, Alice Dowek, Rowanne Sumner, Charlotte Blundell, Emily Preston, Chris Bayliss, Chris Oakley, Carolina Scarton</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensitising language models (LMs) to external context helps them to more effectively capture the speaking patterns of individuals with specific characteristics or in particular environments. This work investigates to what extent rich character and film annotations can be leveraged to personalise LMs in a scalable manner. We then explore the use of such models in evaluating context specificity in machine translation. We build LMs which leverage rich contextual information to reduce perplexity by up to 6.5% compared to a non-contextual model, and generalise well to a scenario with no speaker-specific data, relying on combinations of demographic characteristics expressed via metadata. Our findings are consistent across two corpora, one of which (Cornell-rich) is also a contribution of this paper. We then use our personalised LMs to measure the co-occurrence of extra-textual context and translation hypotheses in a machine translation setting. Our results suggest that the degree to which professional translations in our domain are context-specific can be preserved to a better extent by a contextual machine translation model than a non-contextual model, which is also reflected in the contextual model's superior reference-based scores.</p>

<p>Abstract: Car-following (CF) algorithms are crucial components of traffic simulations and have been integrated into many production vehicles equipped with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Insights from the model of car-following behavior help us understand the causes of various macro phenomena that arise from interactions between pairs of vehicles. Car-following models encompass multiple disciplines, including traffic engineering, physics, dynamic system control, cognitive science, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an extensive survey that highlights the differences, complementarities, and overlaps among microscopic traffic flow and control models based on their underlying principles and design logic. It reviews representative algorithms, ranging from theory-based kinematic models, Psycho-Physical Models, and Adaptive cruise control models to data-driven algorithms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL). The manuscript discusses the strengths and limitations of these models and explores their applications in different contexts. This review synthesizes existing researches across different domains to fill knowledge gaps and offer guidance for future research by identifying the latest trends in car following models and their applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhang Ze Yu, Lau Jia Jaw, Zhang Hui, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by aligning their outputs with desired human values through instruction tuning. However, RLHF is constrained by the expertise and productivity limitations of human evaluators. A response to this downside is to fall back to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with additional carefully selected expert demonstrations. However, while this method has been proven to be effective, it invariably also leads to increased human-in-the-loop overhead. In this study, we propose another alternative approach: Reinforcement Learning with Generative Adversarial Feedback (RLGAF) to RLHF and SFT, which uses a generative adversarial training style to enable the LLMs to learn useful human expert demonstrations without being directly exposed to the training examples, thus enabling good generalization capabilities while preserving sample efficiency. Our preliminary findings indicate that RLGAF can help align LLMs outputs with competitive performance against RLHF and SFT, while not suffering from their respective inherent restrictions, suggesting promising avenues for further research on automating AI alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchuan Tian, Hanting Chen, Xutao Wang, Zheyuan Bai, Qinghua Zhang, Ruifeng Li, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent releases of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT, are astonishing at generating human-like texts, but they may impact the authenticity of texts. Previous works proposed methods to detect these AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based zero-shot methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors always fail on short texts, like SMSes, Tweets, and reviews. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the difficulty of short-text detection without sacrificing long-texts. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase AI text detection as a partial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by regarding these short machine texts as partially ``unlabeled". Then in this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where a recurrent model in abstraction is used to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpora. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpora. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated texts, and significantly improves short-text detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors on various short-text and long-text detection benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob-Junqi Tian, David Emerson, Sevil Zanjani Miyandoab, Deval Pandya, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Faiza Khan Khattak</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting large language models has gained immense popularity in recent years due to the advantage of producing good results even without the need for labelled data. However, this requires prompt tuning to get optimal prompts that lead to better model performances. In this paper, we explore the use of soft-prompt tuning on sentiment classification task to quantify the biases of large language models (LLMs) such as Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT) and Galactica language model. Since these models are trained on real-world data that could be prone to bias toward certain groups of populations, it is important to identify these underlying issues. Using soft-prompts to evaluate bias gives us the extra advantage of avoiding the human-bias injection that can be caused by manually designed prompts. We check the model biases on different sensitive attributes using the group fairness (bias) and find interesting bias patterns. Since LLMs have been used in the industry in various applications, it is crucial to identify the biases before deploying these models in practice. We open-source our pipeline and encourage industry researchers to adapt our work to their use cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an efficient approach to train large diffusion models with masked transformers. While masked transformers have been extensively explored for representation learning, their application to generative learning is less explored in the vision domain. Our work is the first to exploit masked training to reduce the training cost of diffusion models significantly. Specifically, we randomly mask out a high proportion (e.g., 50%) of patches in diffused input images during training. For masked training, we introduce an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture consisting of a transformer encoder that operates only on unmasked patches and a lightweight transformer decoder on full patches. To promote a long-range understanding of full patches, we add an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked patches to the denoising score matching objective that learns the score of unmasked patches. Experiments on ImageNet-256x256 and ImageNet-512x512 show that our approach achieves competitive and even better generative performance than the state-of-the-art Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, using only around 30% of its original training time. Thus, our method shows a promising way of efficiently training large transformer-based diffusion models without sacrificing the generative performance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17256">Could Small Language Models Serve as Recommenders? Towards Data-centric Cold-start Recommendations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuansheng Wu, Huachi Zhou, Yucheng Shi, Wenlin Yao, Xiao Huang, Ninghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommendation systems help users find matched items based on their previous behaviors. Personalized recommendation becomes challenging in the absence of historical user-item interactions, a practical problem for startups known as the system cold-start recommendation. While existing research addresses cold-start issues for either users or items, we still lack solutions for system cold-start scenarios. To tackle the problem, we propose PromptRec, a simple but effective approach based on in-context learning of language models, where we transform the recommendation task into the sentiment analysis task on natural language containing user and item profiles. However, this naive approach heavily relies on the strong in-context learning ability emerged from large language models, which could suffer from significant latency for online recommendations. To solve the challenge, we propose to enhance small language models for recommender systems with a data-centric pipeline, which consists of: (1) constructing a refined corpus for model pre-training; (2) constructing a decomposed prompt template via prompt pre-training. They correspond to the development of training data and inference data, respectively. The pipeline is supported by a theoretical framework that formalizes the connection between in-context recommendation and language modeling. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a cold-start recommendation benchmark, and the results demonstrate that the enhanced small language models can achieve comparable cold-start recommendation performance to that of large models with only $17\%$ of the inference time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to tackle the system cold-start recommendation problem. We believe our findings will provide valuable insights for future works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuijing Liu, Aamir Hasan, Kaiwen Hong, Runxuan Wang, Peixin Chang, Zachary Mizrachi, Justin Lin, D. Livingston McPherson, Wendy A. Rogers, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Persons with visual impairments (PwVI) have difficulties understanding and navigating spaces around them. Current wayfinding technologies either focus solely on navigation or provide limited communication about the environment. Motivated by recent advances in visual-language grounding and semantic navigation, we propose DRAGON, a guiding robot powered by a dialogue system and the ability to associate the environment with natural language. By understanding the commands from the user, DRAGON is able to guide the user to the desired landmarks on the map, describe the environment, and answer questions from visual observations. Through effective utilization of dialogue, the robot can ground the user's free-form descriptions to landmarks in the environment, and give the user semantic information through spoken language. We conduct a user study with blindfolded participants in an everyday indoor environment. Our results demonstrate that DRAGON is able to communicate with the user smoothly, provide a good guiding experience, and connect users with their surrounding environment in an intuitive manner.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bertille Follain, Francis Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning plays a crucial role in automated feature selection, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data, where non-parametric methods often struggle. In this study, we focus on supervised learning scenarios where the pertinent information resides within a lower-dimensional linear subspace of the data, namely the multi-index model. If this subspace were known, it would greatly enhance prediction, computation, and interpretation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for linear feature learning with non-parametric prediction, which simultaneously estimates the prediction function and the linear subspace. Our approach employs empirical risk minimisation, augmented with a penalty on function derivatives, ensuring versatility. Leveraging the orthogonality and rotation invariance properties of Hermite polynomials, we introduce our estimator, named RegFeaL. By utilising alternative minimisation, we iteratively rotate the data to improve alignment with leading directions and accurately estimate the relevant dimension in practical settings. We establish that our method yields a consistent estimator of the prediction function with explicit rates. Additionally, we provide empirical results demonstrating the performance of RegFeaL in various experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalya Weber, Werner Koch, Ozan Erdem, Tom Froese</p>
<p>Abstract: Hopfield networks are an attractive choice for solving many types of computational problems because they provide a biologically plausible mechanism. The Self-Optimization (SO) model adds to the Hopfield network by using a biologically founded Hebbian learning rule, in combination with repeated network resets to arbitrary initial states, for optimizing its own behavior towards some desirable goal state encoded in the network. In order to better understand that process, we demonstrate first that the SO model can solve concrete combinatorial problems in SAT form, using two examples of the Liars problem and the map coloring problem. In addition, we show how under some conditions critical information might get lost forever with the learned network producing seemingly optimal solutions that are in fact inappropriate for the problem it was tasked to solve. What appears to be an undesirable side-effect of the SO model, can provide insight into its process for solving intractable problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) have an important impact on patient outcomes but are incompletely collected from the electronic health records (EHR). This study researched the ability of large language models to extract SDoH from free text in EHRs, where they are most commonly documented, and explored the role of synthetic clinical text for improving the extraction of these scarcely documented, yet extremely valuable, clinical data. 800 patient notes were annotated for SDoH categories, and several transformer-based models were evaluated. The study also experimented with synthetic data generation and assessed for algorithmic bias. Our best-performing models were fine-tuned Flan-T5 XL (macro-F1 0.71) for any SDoH, and Flan-T5 XXL (macro-F1 0.70). The benefit of augmenting fine-tuning with synthetic data varied across model architecture and size, with smaller Flan-T5 models (base and large) showing the greatest improvements in performance (delta F1 +0.12 to +0.23). Model performance was similar on the in-hospital system dataset but worse on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our best-performing fine-tuned models outperformed zero- and few-shot performance of ChatGPT-family models for both tasks. These fine-tuned models were less likely than ChatGPT to change their prediction when race/ethnicity and gender descriptors were added to the text, suggesting less algorithmic bias (p<0.05). At the patient-level, our models identified 93.8% of patients with adverse SDoH, while ICD-10 codes captured 2.0%. Our method can effectively extracted SDoH information from clinic notes, performing better compare to GPT zero- and few-shot settings. These models could enhance real-world evidence on SDoH and aid in identifying patients needing social support.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models may inadvertently memorize sensitive, unauthorized, or malicious data, posing risks of privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, and performance degradation. To address these issues, machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to selectively remove specific training data points' influence on trained models. This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of the solutions in machine unlearning. We categorize existing solutions into exact unlearning approaches that remove data influence thoroughly and approximate unlearning approaches that efficiently minimize data influence. By comprehensively reviewing solutions, we identify and discuss their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose future directions to advance machine unlearning and establish it as an essential capability for trustworthy and adaptive machine learning models. This paper provides researchers with a roadmap of open problems, encouraging impactful contributions to address real-world needs for selective data removal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Progressing towards a new era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - enabled wireless networks, concerns regarding the environmental impact of AI have been raised both in industry and academia. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key privacy preserving decentralized AI technique. Despite efforts currently being made in FL, its environmental impact is still an open problem. Targeting the minimization of the overall energy consumption of an FL process, we propose the orchestration of computational and communication resources of the involved devices to minimize the total energy required, while guaranteeing a certain performance of the model. To this end, we propose a Soft Actor Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution, where a penalty function is introduced during training, penalizing the strategies that violate the constraints of the environment, and contributing towards a safe RL process. A device level synchronization method, along with a computationally cost effective FL environment are proposed, with the goal of further reducing the energy consumption and communication overhead. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme compared to four state-of-the-art baseline solutions on different network environments and FL architectures, achieving a decrease of up to 94% in the total energy consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Zhengyuan Liu, Xin Huang, Fangkai Jiao, Yang Ding, Ai Ti Aw, Nancy F. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SeaEval, a benchmark for multilingual foundation models. In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual" capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for multilingual and multicultural scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Taeb, Amanda Swearngin, Eldon Schoop, Ruijia Cheng, Yue Jiang, Jeffrey Nichols</p>
<p>Abstract: Developers and quality assurance testers often rely on manual testing to test accessibility features throughout the product lifecycle. Unfortunately, manual testing can be tedious, often has an overwhelming scope, and can be difficult to schedule amongst other development milestones. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for a variety of tasks including automation of UIs, however to our knowledge no one has yet explored their use in controlling assistive technologies for the purposes of supporting accessibility testing. In this paper, we explore the requirements of a natural language based accessibility testing workflow, starting with a formative study. From this we build a system that takes as input a manual accessibility test (e.g., ``Search for a show in VoiceOver'') and uses an LLM combined with pixel-based UI Understanding models to execute the test and produce a chaptered, navigable video. In each video, to help QA testers we apply heuristics to detect and flag accessibility issues (e.g., Text size not increasing with Large Text enabled, VoiceOver navigation loops). We evaluate this system through a 10 participant user study with accessibility QA professionals who indicated that the tool would be very useful in their current work and performed tests similarly to how they would manually test the features. The study also reveals insights for future work on using LLMs for accessibility testing.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04295">Identifying Representations for Intervention Extrapolation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sorawit Saengkyongam, Elan Rosenfeld, Pradeep Ravikumar, Niklas Pfister, Jonas Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: The premise of identifiable and causal representation learning is to improve the current representation learning paradigm in terms of generalizability or robustness. Despite recent progress in questions of identifiability, more theoretical results demonstrating concrete advantages of these methods for downstream tasks are needed. In this paper, we consider the task of intervention extrapolation: predicting how interventions affect an outcome, even when those interventions are not observed at training time, and show that identifiable representations can provide an effective solution to this task even if the interventions affect the outcome non-linearly. Our setup includes an outcome Y, observed features X, which are generated as a non-linear transformation of latent features Z, and exogenous action variables A, which influence Z. The objective of intervention extrapolation is to predict how interventions on A that lie outside the training support of A affect Y. Here, extrapolation becomes possible if the effect of A on Z is linear and the residual when regressing Z on A has full support. As Z is latent, we combine the task of intervention extrapolation with identifiable representation learning, which we call Rep4Ex: we aim to map the observed features X into a subspace that allows for non-linear extrapolation in A. We show that the hidden representation is identifiable up to an affine transformation in Z-space, which is sufficient for intervention extrapolation. The identifiability is characterized by a novel constraint describing the linearity assumption of A on Z. Based on this insight, we propose a method that enforces the linear invariance constraint and can be combined with any type of autoencoder. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments and show that our approach succeeds in predicting the effects of unseen interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutaro Yamada, Yihan Bao, Andrew K. Lampinen, Jungo Kasai, Ilker Yildirim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. Despite the models only seeing text in training, several recent studies suggest that LLM representations implicitly capture aspects of the underlying grounded concepts. Here, we explore LLM representations of a particularly salient kind of grounded knowledge -- spatial relationships. We design natural-language navigation tasks and evaluate the ability of LLMs, in particular GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2 series models, to represent and reason about spatial structures. These tasks reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across different spatial structures, including square, hexagonal, and triangular grids, rings, and trees. In extensive error analysis, we find that LLMs' mistakes reflect both spatial and non-spatial factors. These findings suggest that LLMs appear to capture certain aspects of spatial structure implicitly, but room for improvement remains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Wan, Fanyou Wu, Weijie Xu, Srinivasan H. Sengamedu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose sequence-level certainty as a common theme over hallucination in Knowledge Grounded Dialogue Generation (KGDG). We explore the correlation between the level of hallucination and two types of sequence-level certainty: probabilistic certainty and semantic certainty. Empirical results reveal that a higher level of both types of sequence-level certainty in model responses is correlated with a lower level of hallucination. We further propose Certainty-based Response Ranking (CRR), a decoding-time hallucination mitigation method that ranks response candidates based on their sequence-level certainty and outputs the answer with the highest certainty level. Aligning with our definitions of sequence-level certainty, we design 2 types of CRR approaches: Probabilistic CRR (P-CRR) and Semantic CRR (S-CRR). P-CRR ranks individually sampled model responses using the arithmetic mean log-probability of the entire sequence. S-CRR approaches certainty estimation from meaning-space, and ranks model response candidates based on their semantic certainty level as measured by an entailment-based Agreement Score (AS). Through extensive experiments across 3 KGDG datasets, 3 decoding methods, and 4 different models, we validate the effectiveness of the CRR methods in reducing model hallucination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) provides powerful tools for predictive modeling. ML's popularity stems from the promise of sample-level prediction with applications across a variety of fields from physics and marketing to healthcare. However, if not properly implemented and evaluated, ML pipelines may contain leakage typically resulting in overoptimistic performance estimates and failure to generalize to new data. This can have severe negative financial and societal implications. Our aim is to expand understanding associated with causes leading to leakage when designing, implementing, and evaluating ML pipelines. Illustrated by concrete examples, we provide a comprehensive overview and discussion of various types of leakage that may arise in ML pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Scimeca, Alexander Rubinstein, Damien Teney, Seong Joon Oh, Armand Mihai Nicolicioiu, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Spurious correlations in the data, where multiple cues are predictive of the target labels, often lead to a phenomenon known as shortcut bias, where a model relies on erroneous, easy-to-learn cues while ignoring reliable ones. In this work, we propose an ensemble diversification framework exploiting Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) for shortcut bias mitigation. We show that at particular training intervals, DPMs can generate images with novel feature combinations, even when trained on samples displaying correlated input features. We leverage this crucial property to generate synthetic counterfactuals to increase model diversity via ensemble disagreement. We show that DPM-guided diversification is sufficient to remove dependence on primary shortcut cues, without a need for additional supervised signals. We further empirically quantify its efficacy on several diversification objectives, and finally show improved generalization and diversification performance on par with prior work that relies on auxiliary data collection.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08616">A Generalized Neural Diffusion Framework on Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Li, Xiao Wang, Hongrui Liu, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies reveal the connection between GNNs and the diffusion process, which motivates many diffusion-based GNNs to be proposed. However, since these two mechanisms are closely related, one fundamental question naturally arises: Is there a general diffusion framework that can formally unify these GNNs? The answer to this question can not only deepen our understanding of the learning process of GNNs, but also may open a new door to design a broad new class of GNNs. In this paper, we propose a general diffusion equation framework with the fidelity term, which formally establishes the relationship between the diffusion process with more GNNs. Meanwhile, with this framework, we identify one characteristic of graph diffusion networks, i.e., the current neural diffusion process only corresponds to the first-order diffusion equation. However, by an experimental investigation, we show that the labels of high-order neighbors actually exhibit monophily property, which induces the similarity based on labels among high-order neighbors without requiring the similarity among first-order neighbors. This discovery motives to design a new high-order neighbor-aware diffusion equation, and derive a new type of graph diffusion network (HiD-Net) based on the framework. With the high-order diffusion equation, HiD-Net is more robust against attacks and works on both homophily and heterophily graphs. We not only theoretically analyze the relation between HiD-Net with high-order random walk, but also provide a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of HiD-Net over state-of-the-art graph diffusion networks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09932">RDR: the Recap, Deliberate, and Respond Method for Enhanced Language Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Zi, Hariram Veeramani, Kaushik Roy, Amit Sheth</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language understanding (NLU) using neural network pipelines often requires additional context that is not solely present in the input data. Through Prior research, it has been evident that NLU benchmarks are susceptible to manipulation by neural models, wherein these models exploit statistical artifacts within the encoded external knowledge to artificially inflate performance metrics for downstream tasks. Our proposed approach, known as the Recap, Deliberate, and Respond (RDR) paradigm, addresses this issue by incorporating three distinct objectives within the neural network pipeline. Firstly, the Recap objective involves paraphrasing the input text using a paraphrasing model in order to summarize and encapsulate its essence. Secondly, the Deliberation objective entails encoding external graph information related to entities mentioned in the input text, utilizing a graph embedding model. Finally, the Respond objective employs a classification head model that utilizes representations from the Recap and Deliberation modules to generate the final prediction. By cascading these three models and minimizing a combined loss, we mitigate the potential for gaming the benchmark and establish a robust method for capturing the underlying semantic patterns, thus enabling accurate predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RDR method, we conduct tests on multiple GLUE benchmark tasks. Our results demonstrate improved performance compared to competitive baselines, with an enhancement of up to 2\% on standard metrics. Furthermore, we analyze the observed evidence for semantic understanding exhibited by RDR models, emphasizing their ability to avoid gaming the benchmark and instead accurately capture the true underlying semantic patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Cassano, Luisa Li, Akul Sethi, Noah Shinn, Abby Brennan-Jones, Anton Lozhkov, Carolyn Jane Anderson, Arjun Guha</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant amount of research is focused on developing and evaluating large language models for a variety of code synthesis tasks. These include synthesizing code from natural language instructions, synthesizing tests from code, and synthesizing explanations of code. In contrast, the behavior of instructional code editing with LLMs is understudied. These are tasks in which the model is instructed to update a block of code provided in a prompt. The editing instruction may ask for a feature to added or removed, describe a bug and ask for a fix, ask for a different kind of solution, or many other common code editing tasks.
  We introduce a carefully crafted benchmark of code editing tasks and use it evaluate several cutting edge LLMs. Our evaluation exposes a significant gap between the capabilities of state-of-the-art open and closed models. For example, even GPT-3.5-Turbo is 8.8% better than the best open model at editing code.
  We also introduce a new, carefully curated, permissively licensed training set of code edits coupled with natural language instructions. Using this training set, we show that we can fine-tune open Code LLMs to significantly improve their code editing capabilities.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04577">Masked Audio Generation using a Single Non-Autoregressive Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alon Ziv, Itai Gat, Gael Le Lan, Tal Remez, Felix Kreuk, Alexandre D\'efossez, Jade Copet, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MAGNeT, a masked generative sequence modeling method that operates directly over several streams of audio tokens. Unlike prior work, MAGNeT is comprised of a single-stage, non-autoregressive transformer. During training, we predict spans of masked tokens obtained from a masking scheduler, while during inference we gradually construct the output sequence using several decoding steps. To further enhance the quality of the generated audio, we introduce a novel rescoring method in which, we leverage an external pre-trained model to rescore and rank predictions from MAGNeT, which will be then used for later decoding steps. Lastly, we explore a hybrid version of MAGNeT, in which we fuse between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models to generate the first few seconds in an autoregressive manner while the rest of the sequence is being decoded in parallel. We demonstrate the efficiency of MAGNeT for the task of text-to-music and text-to-audio generation and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering both objective metrics and human studies. The proposed approach is comparable to the evaluated baselines, while being significantly faster (x7 faster than the autoregressive baseline).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Langwen Huang, Lukas Gianinazzi, Yuejiang Yu, Peter D. Dueben, Torsten Hoefler</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of initial conditions via accurate data assimilation is crucial for weather forecasting and climate modeling. We propose DiffDA as a denoising diffusion model capable of assimilating atmospheric variables using predicted states and sparse observations. Acknowledging the similarity between a weather forecast model and a denoising diffusion model dedicated to weather applications, we adapt the pretrained GraphCast neural network as the backbone of the diffusion model. Through experiments based on simulated observations from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, our method can produce assimilated global atmospheric data consistent with observations at 0.25 deg (~30km) resolution globally. This marks the highest resolution achieved by ML data assimilation models. The experiments also show that the initial conditions assimilated from sparse observations (less than 0.77% of gridded data) and 48-hour forecast can be used for forecast models with a loss of lead time of at most 24 hours compared to initial conditions from state-of-the-art data assimilation in ERA5. This enables the application of the method to real-world applications, such as creating reanalysis datasets with autoregressive data assimilation.</p>

<p>Abstract: How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation is an open question. Many benchmarks have been proposed but are inconsistent with practical software projects, e.g., unreal program distributions, insufficient dependencies, and small-scale project contexts. Thus, the capabilities of LLMs in practical projects are still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark named DevEval, aligned with Developers' experiences in practical projects. DevEval is collected through a rigorous pipeline, containing 2,690 samples from 119 practical projects and covering 10 domains. Compared to previous benchmarks, DevEval aligns to practical projects in multiple dimensions, e.g., real program distributions, sufficient dependencies, and enough-scale project contexts. We assess five popular LLMs on DevEval (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, CodeLLaMa, and StarCoder) and reveal their actual abilities in code generation. For instance, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-3.5-turbo only is 42 in our experiments. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of code generation in practical projects. We open-source DevEval and hope it can facilitate the development of code generation in practical projects.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16461">Norm Enforcement with a Soft Touch: Faster Emergence, Happier Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sz-Ting Tzeng, Nirav Ajmeri, Munindar P. Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: A multiagent system is a society of autonomous agents whose interactions can be regulated via social norms. In general, the norms of a society are not hardcoded but emerge from the agents' interactions. Specifically, how the agents in a society react to each other's behavior and respond to the reactions of others determines which norms emerge in the society. We think of these reactions by an agent to the satisfactory or unsatisfactory behaviors of another agent as communications from the first agent to the second agent. Understanding these communications is a kind of social intelligence: these communications provide natural drivers for norm emergence by pushing agents toward certain behaviors, which can become established as norms. Whereas it is well-known that sanctioning can lead to the emergence of norms, we posit that a broader kind of social intelligence can prove more effective in promoting cooperation in a multiagent system.
  Accordingly, we develop Nest, a framework that models social intelligence via a wider variety of communications and understanding of them than in previous work. To evaluate Nest, we develop a simulated pandemic environment and conduct simulation experiments to compare Nest with baselines considering a combination of three kinds of social communication: sanction, tell, and hint.
  We find that societies formed of Nest agents achieve norms faster. Moreover, Nest agents effectively avoid undesirable consequences, which are negative sanctions and deviation from goals, and yield higher satisfaction for themselves than baseline agents despite requiring only an equivalent amount of information.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16650">Augmenting Replay in World Models for Continual Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Yang, Levin Kuhlmann, Gideon Kowadlo</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual RL is a challenging problem where the agent is exposed to a sequence of tasks; it should learn new tasks without forgetting old ones, and learning the new task should improve performance on previous and future tasks. The most common approaches use model-free RL algorithms as a base, and replay buffers have been used to overcome catastrophic forgetting. However, the buffers are often very large making scalability difficult. Also, the concept of replay comes from biological inspiration, where evidence suggests that replay is applied to a world model, which implies model-based RL -- and model-based RL should have benefits for continual RL, where it is possible to exploit knowledge independent of the policy. We present WMAR, World Models with Augmented Replay, a model-based RL algorithm with a world model and memory efficient distribution matching replay buffer. It is based on the well-known DreamerV3 algorithm, which has a simple FIFO buffer and was not tested in a continual RL setting. We evaluated WMAR vs WMAR (FIFO only) on tasks with and without shared structure from OpenAI ProcGen and Atari respectively, and without a task oracle. We found that WMAR has favourable properties on continual RL with significantly reduced computational overhead compared to WMAR (FIFO only). WMAR had small benefits over DreamerV3 on tasks with shared structure and substantially better forgetting characteristics on tasks without shared structure; but at the cost of lower plasticity seen in a lower maximum on new tasks. The results suggest that model-based RL using a world model with a memory efficient replay buffer can be an effective and practical approach to continual RL, justifying future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Stirn, David A. Knowles</p>
<p>Abstract: Current clustering priors for deep latent variable models (DLVMs) require defining the number of clusters a-priori and are susceptible to poor initializations. Addressing these deficiencies could greatly benefit deep learning-based scRNA-seq analysis by performing integration and clustering simultaneously. We adapt the VampPrior (Tomczak & Welling, 2018) into a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel prior for DLVMs. We propose an inference procedure that alternates between variational inference and Empirical Bayes to cleanly distinguish variational and prior parameters. Using the VMM in a Variational Autoencoder attains highly competitive clustering performance on benchmark datasets. Augmenting scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular scRNA-seq integration method, with the VMM significantly improves its performance and automatically arranges cells into biologically meaningful clusters.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06700">Entropy-Regularized Token-Level Policy Optimization for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muning Wen, Cheng Deng, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as intelligent agents in interactive decision-making tasks. Traditional approaches often depend on meticulously designed prompts, high-quality examples, or additional reward models for in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, or RLHF. Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a dynamic alternative for LLMs to overcome these dependencies by engaging directly with task-specific environments. Nonetheless, it faces significant hurdles: 1) instability stemming from the exponentially vast action space requiring exploration; 2) challenges in assigning token-level credit based on action-level reward signals, resulting in discord between maximizing rewards and accurately modeling corpus data. In response to these challenges, we introduce Entropy-Regularized Token-level Policy Optimization (ETPO), an entropy-augmented RL method tailored for optimizing LLMs at the token level. At the heart of ETPO is our novel per-token soft Bellman update, designed to harmonize the RL process with the principles of language modeling. This methodology decomposes the Q-function update from a coarse action-level view to a more granular token-level perspective, backed by theoretical proof of optimization consistency. Crucially, this decomposition renders linear time complexity in action exploration. We assess the effectiveness of ETPO within a simulated environment that models data science code generation as a series of multi-step interactive tasks; results show that ETPO achieves effective performance improvement on the CodeLlama-7B model and surpasses a variant PPO baseline inherited from RLHF. This underlines ETPO's potential as a robust method for refining the interactive decision-making capabilities of LLMs. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/morning9393/ETPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyifei Luo, Zhuo Chen, Lingbing Guo, Qian Li, Wenxuan Zeng, Zhixin Cai, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims to identify entities across different knowledge graphs that represent the same real-world objects. Recent embedding-based EA methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in EA yet faced interpretability challenges as they purely rely on the embedding distance and neglect the logic rules behind a pair of aligned entities. In this paper, we propose the Align-Subgraph Entity Alignment (ASGEA) framework to exploit logic rules from Align-Subgraphs. ASGEA uses anchor links as bridges to construct Align-Subgraphs and spreads along the paths across KGs, which distinguishes it from the embedding-based methods. Furthermore, we design an interpretable Path-based Graph Neural Network, ASGNN, to effectively identify and integrate the logic rules across KGs. We also introduce a node-level multi-modal attention mechanism coupled with multi-modal enriched anchors to augment the Align-Subgraph. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ASGEA over the existing embedding-based methods in both EA and Multi-Modal EA (MMEA) tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingtian Zhang, Shawn Lan, Peter Hayes, David Barber</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective solution for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). The retrieval stage in RAG typically involves a pre-trained embedding model, which converts queries and passages into vectors to capture their semantics. However, a standard pre-trained embedding model may exhibit sub-optimal performance when applied to specific domain knowledge, necessitating fine-tuning. This paper addresses scenarios where the embeddings are only available from a black-box model. We introduce Model augmented fine-tuning (Mafin) -- a novel approach for fine-tuning a black-box embedding model by augmenting it with a trainable embedding model. Our results demonstrate that Mafin significantly enhances the performance of the black-box embeddings by only requiring the training of a small augmented model. We validate the effectiveness of our method on both labeled and unlabeled datasets, illustrating its broad applicability and efficiency.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12721">PAC-FNO: Parallel-Structured All-Component Fourier Neural Operators for Recognizing Low-Quality Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsung Jeon, Hyundong Jin, Jonghyun Choi, Sanghyun Hong, Dongeun Lee, Kookjin Lee, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: A standard practice in developing image recognition models is to train a model on a specific image resolution and then deploy it. However, in real-world inference, models often encounter images different from the training sets in resolution and/or subject to natural variations such as weather changes, noise types and compression artifacts. While traditional solutions involve training multiple models for different resolutions or input variations, these methods are computationally expensive and thus do not scale in practice. To this end, we propose a novel neural network model, parallel-structured and all-component Fourier neural operator (PAC-FNO), that addresses the problem. Unlike conventional feed-forward neural networks, PAC-FNO operates in the frequency domain, allowing it to handle images of varying resolutions within a single model. We also propose a two-stage algorithm for training PAC-FNO with a minimal modification to the original, downstream model. Moreover, the proposed PAC-FNO is ready to work with existing image recognition models. Extensively evaluating methods with seven image recognition benchmarks, we show that the proposed PAC-FNO improves the performance of existing baseline models on images with various resolutions by up to 77.1% and various types of natural variations in the images at inference.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14160">Recursive Speculative Decoding: Accelerating LLM Inference via Sampling Without Replacement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonseok Jeon, Mukul Gagrani, Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mingu Lee, Christopher Lott</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is an inference-acceleration method for large language models (LLMs) where a small language model generates a draft-token sequence which is further verified by the target LLM in parallel. Recent works have advanced this method by establishing a draft-token tree, achieving superior performance over a single-sequence speculative decoding. However, those works independently generate tokens at each level of the tree, not leveraging the tree's entire diversifiability. Besides, their empirical superiority has been shown for fixed length of sequences, implicitly granting more computational resource to LLM for the tree-based methods. None of the existing works has conducted empirical studies with fixed target computational budgets despite its importance to resource-bounded devices. We present Recursive Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel tree-based method that samples draft tokens without replacement and maximizes the diversity of the tree. During RSD's drafting, the tree is built by either Gumbel-Top-$k$ trick that draws tokens without replacement in parallel or Stochastic Beam Search that samples sequences without replacement while early-truncating unlikely draft sequences and reducing the computational cost of LLM. We empirically evaluate RSD with Llama 2 and OPT models, showing that RSD outperforms the baseline methods, consistently for fixed draft sequence length and in most cases for fixed computational budgets at LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Guo, Lianghao Xia, Yanhua Yu, Yuling Wang, Zixuan Yang, Wei Wei, Liang Pang, Tat-Seng Chua, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Structure Learning (GSL) focuses on capturing intrinsic dependencies and interactions among nodes in graph-structured data by generating novel graph structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising GSL solutions, utilizing recursive message passing to encode node-wise inter-dependencies. However, many existing GSL methods heavily depend on explicit graph structural information as supervision signals, leaving them susceptible to challenges such as data noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose GraphEdit, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to learn complex node relationships in graph-structured data. By enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through instruction-tuning over graph structures, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit graph structural information and enhance the reliability of graph structure learning. Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peigen Ye, Yaping Sun, Shumin Yao, Hao Chen, Xiaodong Xu, Shuguang Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Codebook-based generative semantic communication attracts increasing attention, since only indices are required to be transmitted when the codebook is shared between transmitter and receiver. However, due to the fact that the semantic relations among code vectors are not necessarily related to the distance of the corresponding code indices, the performance of the codebook-enabled semantic communication system is susceptible to the channel noise. Thus, how to improve the system robustness against the noise requires careful design. This paper proposes a robust codebook-assisted image semantic communication system, where semantic codec and codebook are first jointly constructed, and then vector-to-index transformer is designed guided by the codebook to eliminate the effects of channel noise, and achieve image generation. Thanks to the assistance of the high-quality codebook to the Transformer, the generated images at the receiver outperform those of the compared methods in terms of visual perception. In the end, numerical results and generated images demonstrate the advantages of the generative semantic communication method over JPEG+LDPC and traditional joint source channel coding (JSCC) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Hu, Jingtong Gao, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuehong Hu, Yuxuan Liang, Yiqi Wang, Ming He, Zitao Liu, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of multimodal information into sequential recommender systems has attracted significant attention in recent research. In the initial stages of multimodal sequential recommendation models, the mainstream paradigm was ID-dominant recommendations, wherein multimodal information was fused as side information. However, due to their limitations in terms of transferability and information intrusion, another paradigm emerged, wherein multimodal features were employed directly for recommendation, enabling recommendation across datasets. Nonetheless, it overlooked user ID information, resulting in low information utilization and high training costs. To this end, we propose an innovative framework, BivRec, that jointly trains the recommendation tasks in both ID and multimodal views, leveraging their synergistic relationship to enhance recommendation performance bidirectionally. To tackle the information heterogeneity issue, we first construct structured user interest representations and then learn the synergistic relationship between them. Specifically, BivRec comprises three modules: Multi-scale Interest Embedding, comprehensively modeling user interests by expanding user interaction sequences with multi-scale patching; Intra-View Interest Decomposition, constructing highly structured interest representations using carefully designed Gaussian attention and Cluster attention; and Cross-View Interest Learning, learning the synergistic relationship between the two recommendation views through coarse-grained overall semantic similarity and fine-grained interest allocation similarity BiVRec achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets and showcases various practical advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ha Min Son, Moon-Hyun Kim, Tai-Myoung Chung, Chao Huang, Xin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a promising framework to train neural networks with widely distributed data. However, performance degrades heavily with heterogeneously distributed data. Recent work has shown this is due to the final layer of the network being most prone to local bias, some finding success freezing the final layer as an orthogonal classifier. We investigate the training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings. Based on this finding, we introduce two regularization terms for local training to continuously emulate IID settings: (1) variance in the dimension-wise probability distribution of the classifier and (2) hyperspherical uniformity of representations of the encoder. These regularizations promote local models to act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution, thus offsetting proneness to bias while being flexible to the data. On extensive experiments in both label-shift and feature-shift settings, we verify that our method achieves highest performance by a large margin especially in highly non-IID cases in addition to being scalable to larger models and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years,the entire field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has enjoyed amazing novel results achieving almost human-like performance on a variety of tasks. Legal NLP domain has also been part of this process, as it has seen an impressive growth. However, general-purpose models are not readily applicable for legal domain. Due to the nature of the domain (e.g. specialized vocabulary, long documents) specific models and methods are often needed for Legal NLP. In this work we investigate both specialized and general models for predicting the final ruling of a legal case, task known as Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). We particularly focus on methods to extend to sequence length of Transformer-based models to better understand the long documents present in legal corpora. Extensive experiments on 4 LJP datasets in Romanian, originating from 2 sources with significantly different sizes and document lengths, show that specialized models and handling long texts are critical for a good performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanghan Xu, Bin Shi, Ao Liu, Jiqiang Zhang, Bo Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNN), more and more graph datasets have been published for GNN tasks. However, when an upstream data owner publishes graph data, there are often many privacy concerns, because many real-world graph data contain sensitive information like person's friend list. Differential privacy (DP) is a common method to protect privacy, but due to the complex topological structure of graph data, applying DP on graphs often affects the message passing and aggregation of GNN models, leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel graph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect graph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically unchanged. Through reverse learning and the encoder-decoder mechanism, we search for some false edges that do not have a large negative impact on the aggregation of node features, and use them to replace some real edges. The modified graph will be published, which is difficult to distinguish between real and false data. Sufficient experiments prove that our framework achieves model accuracy close to the original graph with an extremely low privacy budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Kou, Lanxiang Hu, Zhezhi He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallel decoding methods such as Jacobi decoding show promise for more efficient LLM inference as it breaks the sequential nature of the LLM decoding process and transforms it into parallelizable computation. However, in practice, it achieves little speedup compared to traditional autoregressive (AR) decoding, primarily because Jacobi decoding seldom accurately predicts more than one token in a single fixed-point iteration step. To address this, we develop a new approach aimed at realizing fast convergence from any state to the fixed point on a Jacobi trajectory. This is accomplished by refining the target LLM to consistently predict the fixed point given any state as input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing 2.4$\times$ to 3.4$\times$ improvements in generation speed while preserving generation quality across both domain-specific and open-domain benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomeng Hu, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a prominent generative AI tool, where the user enters a query and the LLM generates an answer. To reduce harm and misuse, efforts have been made to align these LLMs to human values using advanced training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial jailbreak attempts aiming at subverting the embedded safety guardrails. To address this challenge, this paper defines and investigates the Refusal Loss of LLMs and then proposes a method called Gradient Cuff to detect jailbreak attempts. Gradient Cuff exploits the unique properties observed in the refusal loss landscape, including functional values and its smoothness, to design an effective two-step detection strategy. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and Vicuna-7B-V1.5) and six types of jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Base64, and LRL) show that Gradient Cuff can significantly improve the LLM's rejection capability for malicious jailbreak queries, while maintaining the model's performance for benign user queries by adjusting the detection threshold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Margherita Martorana, Tobias Kuhn, Lise Stork, Jacco van Ossenbruggen</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional dataset retrieval systems index on metadata information rather than on the data values. Thus relying primarily on manual annotations and high-quality metadata, processes known to be labour-intensive and challenging to automate. We propose a method to support metadata enrichment with topic annotations of column headers using three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard and GoogleGemini. We investigate the LLMs ability to classify column headers based on domain-specific topics from a controlled vocabulary. We evaluate our approach by assessing the internal consistency of the LLMs, the inter-machine alignment, and the human-machine agreement for the topic classification task. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e. dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our results suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard for internal consistency as well as LLM-human-alignment. Interestingly, we found that context had no impact on the LLMs performances. This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for text classification using a controlled topic vocabulary, which has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00890">Improving Android Malware Detection Through Data Augmentation Using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawana Stalin, Mikias Berhanu Mekoya</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their versatility across various applications, including data augmentation and malware detection. This research explores the effectiveness of utilizing GAN-generated data to train a model for the detection of Android malware. Given the considerable storage requirements of Android applications, the study proposes a method to synthetically represent data using GANs, thereby reducing storage demands. The proposed methodology involves creating image representations of features extracted from an existing dataset. A GAN model is then employed to generate a more extensive dataset consisting of realistic synthetic grayscale images. Subsequently, this synthetic dataset is utilized to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify previously unseen Android malware applications. The study includes a comparative analysis of the CNN's performance when trained on real images versus synthetic images generated by the GAN. Furthermore, the research explores variations in performance between the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The investigation extends to studying the impact of image size and malware obfuscation on the classification model's effectiveness. The data augmentation approach implemented in this study resulted in a notable performance enhancement of the classification model, ranging from 1.5% to 7%, depending on the dataset. The highest achieved F1 score reached 0.975.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01053">Seeing Unseen: Discover Novel Biomedical Concepts via Geometry-Constrained Probabilistic Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Fan, Dongnan Liu, Hang Chang, Heng Huang, Mei Chen, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning holds tremendous promise for transforming the fundamental practice of scientific discovery by virtue of its data-driven nature. With the ever-increasing stream of research data collection, it would be appealing to autonomously explore patterns and insights from observational data for discovering novel classes of phenotypes and concepts. However, in the biomedical domain, there are several challenges inherently presented in the cumulated data which hamper the progress of novel class discovery. The non-i.i.d. data distribution accompanied by the severe imbalance among different groups of classes essentially leads to ambiguous and biased semantic representations. In this work, we present a geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling treatment to resolve the identified issues. First, we propose to parameterize the approximated posterior of instance embedding as a marginal von MisesFisher distribution to account for the interference of distributional latent bias. Then, we incorporate a suite of critical geometric properties to impose proper constraints on the layout of constructed embedding space, which in turn minimizes the uncontrollable risk for unknown class learning and structuring. Furthermore, a spectral graph-theoretic method is devised to estimate the number of potential novel classes. It inherits two intriguing merits compared to existent approaches, namely high computational efficiency and flexibility for taxonomy-adaptive estimation. Extensive experiments across various biomedical scenarios substantiate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01131">LLaMoCo: Instruction Tuning of Large Language Models for Optimization Code Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Ma, Hongshu Guo, Jiacheng Chen, Guojun Peng, Zhiguang Cao, Yining Ma, Yue-Jiao Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research explores optimization using large language models (LLMs) by either iteratively seeking next-step solutions from LLMs or directly prompting LLMs for an optimizer. However, these approaches exhibit inherent limitations, including low operational efficiency, high sensitivity to prompt design, and a lack of domain-specific knowledge. We introduce LLaMoCo, the first instruction-tuning framework designed to adapt LLMs for solving optimization problems in a code-to-code manner. Specifically, we establish a comprehensive instruction set containing well-described problem prompts and effective optimization codes. We then develop a novel two-phase learning strategy that incorporates a contrastive learning-based warm-up procedure before the instruction-tuning phase to enhance the convergence behavior during model fine-tuning. The experiment results demonstrate that a CodeGen (350M) model fine-tuned by our LLaMoCo achieves superior optimization performance compared to GPT-4 Turbo and the other competitors across both synthetic and realistic problem sets. The fine-tuned model and the usage instructions are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaMoCo-722A.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01528">Leveraging Biomolecule and Natural Language through Multi-Modal Learning: A Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhi Pei, Lijun Wu, Kaiyuan Gao, Jinhua Zhu, Yue Wang, Zun Wang, Tao Qin, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of biomolecular modeling with natural language (BL) has emerged as a promising interdisciplinary area at the intersection of artificial intelligence, chemistry and biology. This approach leverages the rich, multifaceted descriptions of biomolecules contained within textual data sources to enhance our fundamental understanding and enable downstream computational tasks such as biomolecule property prediction. The fusion of the nuanced narratives expressed through natural language with the structural and functional specifics of biomolecules described via various molecular modeling techniques opens new avenues for comprehensively representing and analyzing biomolecules. By incorporating the contextual language data that surrounds biomolecules into their modeling, BL aims to capture a holistic view encompassing both the symbolic qualities conveyed through language as well as quantitative structural characteristics. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of recent advancements achieved through cross modeling of biomolecules and natural language. (1) We begin by outlining the technical representations of biomolecules employed, including sequences, 2D graphs, and 3D structures. (2) We then examine in depth the rationale and key objectives underlying effective multi-modal integration of language and molecular data sources. (3) We subsequently survey the practical applications enabled to date in this developing research area. (4) We also compile and summarize the available resources and datasets to facilitate future work. (5) Looking ahead, we identify several promising research directions worthy of further exploration and investment to continue advancing the field.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01548">In-Context Sharpness as Alerts: An Inner Representation Perspective for Hallucination Mitigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Chen, Miao Xiong, Junteng Liu, Zhengxuan Wu, Teng Xiao, Siyang Gao, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate and produce factual errors, yet our understanding of why they make these errors remains limited. In this study, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of LLM hallucinations from the perspective of inner representations, and discover a salient pattern associated with hallucinations: correct generations tend to have sharper context activations in the hidden states of the in-context tokens, compared to the incorrect ones. Leveraging this insight, we propose an entropy-based metric to quantify the ``sharpness'' among the in-context hidden states and incorporate it into the decoding process to formulate a constrained decoding approach. Experiments on various knowledge-seeking and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate our approach's consistent effectiveness, for example, achieving up to an 8.6 point improvement on TruthfulQA. We believe this study can improve our understanding of hallucinations and serve as a practical solution for hallucination mitigation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02241">Neural Redshift: Random Networks are not Random Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien Teney, Armand Nicolicioiu, Valentin Hartmann, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs.
  Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine untrained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent "simplicity bias". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks.
  Implications. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradient-based training. It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.</p>
