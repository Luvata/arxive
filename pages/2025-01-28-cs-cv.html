Alvarez, Bryan Catanzaro, Jan Kautz, Andrew Tao, Guilin Liu, Zhiding Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, promising progress has been made by open-source vision-language models (VLMs) in bringing their capabilities closer to those of proprietary frontier models. However, most open-source models only publish their final model weights, leaving the critical details of data strategies and implementation largely opaque. In this work, we address VLM post-training from a data-centric perspective, showing the key role of data strategy in developing frontier VLMs. By studying and building our post-training data strategy from scratch, we share detailed insights into the development processes, aiming to benefit the development of competitive models for the open-source community. Our introduced data strategy, together with training recipes and model design, leads to a family of performant VLMs named Eagle2. Specifically, Eagle2-9B achieves state-of-the-art results across various multimodal benchmarks, matching certain competitive models with up to 70B parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Israa Al Badarneh, Bassam Hammo, Omar Al-Kadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning creates informative text from an input image by creating a relationship between the words and the actual content of an image. Recently, deep learning models that utilize transformers have been the most successful in automatically generating image captions. The capabilities of transformer networks have led to notable progress in several activities related to vision. In this paper, we thoroughly examine transformer models, emphasizing the critical role that attention mechanisms play. The proposed model uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to create textual captions and a deep learning convolutional neural network to extract features from the images. To create the captions, we present a novel ensemble learning framework that improves the richness of the generated captions by utilizing several deep neural network architectures based on a voting mechanism that chooses the caption with the highest bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score. The proposed model was evaluated using publicly available datasets. Using the Flickr8K dataset, the proposed model achieved the highest BLEU-[1-3] scores with rates of 0.728, 0.495, and 0.323, respectively. The suggested model outperformed the latest methods in Flickr30k datasets, determined by BLEU-[1-4] scores with rates of 0.798, 0.561, 0.387, and 0.269, respectively. The model efficacy was also obtained by the Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (SPICE) metric with a scoring rate of 0.164 for the Flicker8k dataset and 0.387 for the Flicker30k. Finally, ensemble learning significantly advances the process of image captioning and, hence, can be leveraged in various applications across different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirza Ahsan Ullah, Tehseen Zia</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening diseases worldwide, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods, reliant on clinical expertise and histopathological analysis, are often time-intensive, subjective, and prone to variability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks to achieve high classification accuracy and enhanced interpretability. The motivation for incorporating RBF Networks lies in their intrinsic interpretability and localized response to input features, which make them well-suited for tasks requiring transparency and fine-grained decision-making. Unlike traditional deep learning models that rely on global feature representations, RBF Networks allow for mapping segments of images to chosen prototypes, exploiting salient features within a single image. This enables clinicians to trace predictions to specific, interpretable patterns. The framework incorporates segmentation-based feature extraction, active learning for prototype selection, and K-Medoids clustering to focus on these salient features. Evaluations on the ISIC 2016 and ISIC 2017 datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving classification accuracies of 83.02\% and 72.15\% using ResNet50, respectively, and outperforming VGG16-based configurations. By generating interpretable explanations for predictions, the framework aligns with clinical workflows, bridging the gap between predictive performance and trustworthiness. This study highlights the potential of hybrid models to deliver actionable insights, advancing the development of reliable AI-assisted diagnostic tools for high-stakes medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaojie Zheng, Jiucai Zhang, Xiaoli Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current deep learning powered appearance based uncertainty-aware gaze estimation models produce inconsistent and unreliable uncertainty estimation that limits their adoptions in downstream applications. In this study, we propose a workflow to improve the accuracy of uncertainty estimation using probability calibration with a few post hoc samples. The probability calibration process employs a simple secondary regression model to compensate for inaccuracies in estimated uncertainties from the deep learning model. Training of the secondary model is detached from the main deep learning model and thus no expensive weight tuning is required. The added calibration process is lightweight and relatively independent from the deep learning process, making it fast to run and easy to implement. We evaluated the effectiveness of the calibration process under four potential application scenarios with two datasets that have distinctive image characteristics due to the data collection setups. The calibration process is most effective when the calibration and testing data share similar characteristics. Even under suboptimal circumstances that calibration and testing data differ, the calibration process can still make corrections to reduce prediction errors in uncertainty estimates made by uncalibrated models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Sun, Hao Kang, Li Guan, Haoxiang Li, Philippos Mordohai, Gang Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a deep learning model, dubbed Glissando-Net, to simultaneously estimate the pose and reconstruct the 3D shape of objects at the category level from a single RGB image. Previous works predominantly focused on either estimating poses(often at the instance level), or reconstructing shapes, but not both. Glissando-Net is composed of two auto-encoders that are jointly trained, one for RGB images and the other for point clouds. We embrace two key design choices in Glissando-Net to achieve a more accurate prediction of the 3D shape and pose of the object given a single RGB image as input. First, we augment the feature maps of the point cloud encoder and decoder with transformed feature maps from the image decoder, enabling effective 2D-3D interaction in both training and prediction. Second, we predict both the 3D shape and pose of the object in the decoder stage. This way, we better utilize the information in the 3D point clouds presented only in the training stage to train the network for more accurate prediction. We jointly train the two encoder-decoders for RGB and point cloud data to learn how to pass latent features to the point cloud decoder during inference. In testing, the encoder of the 3D point cloud is discarded. The design of Glissando-Net is inspired by codeSLAM. Unlike codeSLAM, which targets 3D reconstruction of scenes, we focus on pose estimation and shape reconstruction of objects, and directly predict the object pose and a pose invariant 3D reconstruction without the need of the code optimization step. Extensive experiments, involving both ablation studies and comparison with competing methods, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madeline Anderson, Miriam Cha, William T. Freeman, J. Taylor Perron, Nathaniel Maidel, Kerri Cahoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models have achieved impressive results across various fields. However, adoption in remote sensing remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of paired image-text data. To bridge this gap, synthetic caption generation has gained interest, traditionally relying on rule-based methods that use metadata or bounding boxes. While these approaches provide some description, they often lack the depth needed to capture complex wide-area scenes. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for generating more descriptive captions, yet they can produce generic outputs and are prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose a new method to enhance vision-language datasets for remote sensing by integrating maps as external data sources, enabling the generation of detailed, context-rich captions. Additionally, we present methods to measure and mitigate hallucinations in LLM-generated text. We introduce fMoW-mm, a multimodal dataset incorporating satellite imagery, maps, metadata, and text annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness for automatic target recognition in few-shot settings, achieving superior performance compared to other vision-language remote sensing datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sven Elflein, Qunjie Zhou, S\'ergio Agostinho, Laura Leal-Taix\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Light3R-SfM, a feed-forward, end-to-end learnable framework for efficient large-scale Structure-from-Motion (SfM) from unconstrained image collections. Unlike existing SfM solutions that rely on costly matching and global optimization to achieve accurate 3D reconstructions, Light3R-SfM addresses this limitation through a novel latent global alignment module. This module replaces traditional global optimization with a learnable attention mechanism, effectively capturing multi-view constraints across images for robust and precise camera pose estimation. Light3R-SfM constructs a sparse scene graph via retrieval-score-guided shortest path tree to dramatically reduce memory usage and computational overhead compared to the naive approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light3R-SfM achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks in real-world applications with a runtime constraint. This work pioneers a data-driven, feed-forward SfM approach, paving the way toward scalable, accurate, and efficient 3D reconstruction in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Kamrul Hasan, Guang Yang, Choon Hwai Yap</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac anatomy segmentation is essential for clinical assessment of cardiac function and disease diagnosis to inform treatment and intervention. In performing segmentation, deep learning (DL) algorithms improved accuracy significantly compared to traditional image processing approaches. More recently, studies showed that enhancing DL segmentation with motion information can further improve it. A range of methods for injecting motion information has been proposed, but many of them increase the dimensionality of input images (which is computationally expensive) or have not used an optimal method to insert motion information, such as non-DL registration, non-attention-based networks or single-headed attention. Here, we present a novel, computation-efficient alternative where a novel, scalable temporal attention module (TAM) extracts temporal feature interactions multiple times and where TAM has a multi-headed, KQV projection cross-attention architecture. The module can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing CNN- or Transformer-based networks, providing novel flexibility for inclusion in future implementations. Extensive evaluations on different cardiac datasets, 2D echocardiography (CAMUS), and 3D echocardiography (MITEA) demonstrate the model's effectiveness when integrated into well-established backbone networks like UNet, FCN8s, UNetR, SwinUNetR, and the recent I2UNet. We further find that the optimized TAM-enhanced FCN8s network performs well compared to contemporary alternatives. Our results confirm TAM's robustness, scalability, and generalizability across diverse datasets and backbones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Xue, Sven Elflein, Laura Leal-Taix\'e, Qunjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Establishing correspondences across images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, underpinning tasks like Structure-from-Motion, image editing, and point tracking. Traditional methods are often specialized for specific correspondence types, geometric, semantic, or temporal, whereas humans naturally identify alignments across these domains. Inspired by this flexibility, we propose MATCHA, a unified feature model designed to ``rule them all'', establishing robust correspondences across diverse matching tasks. Building on insights that diffusion model features can encode multiple correspondence types, MATCHA augments this capacity by dynamically fusing high-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-based module, creating expressive, versatile, and robust features. Additionally, MATCHA integrates object-level features from DINOv2 to further boost generalization, enabling a single feature capable of matching anything. Extensive experiments validate that MATCHA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching tasks, setting a new foundation for a unified approach for the fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, MATCHA is the first approach that is able to effectively tackle diverse matching tasks with a single unified feature.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14999">VideoPure: Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification for Video Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixun Jiang, Zhaoyu Chen, Jiyuan Fu, Lingyi Hong, Jinglun Li, Wenqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work indicates that video recognition models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing a serious security risk to downstream applications. However, current research has primarily focused on adversarial attacks, with limited work exploring defense mechanisms. Furthermore, due to the spatial-temporal complexity of videos, existing video defense methods face issues of high cost, overfitting, and limited defense performance. Recently, diffusion-based adversarial purification methods have achieved robust defense performance in the image domain. However, due to the additional temporal dimension in videos, directly applying these diffusion-based adversarial purification methods to the video domain suffers performance and efficiency degradation. To achieve an efficient and effective video adversarial defense method, we propose the first diffusion-based video purification framework to improve video recognition models' adversarial robustness: VideoPure. Given an adversarial example, we first employ temporal DDIM inversion to transform the input distribution into a temporally consistent and trajectory-defined distribution, covering adversarial noise while preserving more video structure. Then, during DDIM denoising, we leverage intermediate results at each denoising step and conduct guided spatial-temporal optimization, removing adversarial noise while maintaining temporal consistency. Finally, we input the list of optimized intermediate results into the video recognition model for multi-step voting to obtain the predicted class. We investigate the defense performance of our method against black-box, gray-box, and adaptive attacks on benchmark datasets and models. Compared with other adversarial purification methods, our method overall demonstrates better defense performance against different attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingzhi Tang, Qijian Zhang, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: We present HuGDiffusion, a generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) learning pipeline to achieve novel view synthesis (NVS) of human characters from single-view input images. Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongqi Wang, Jia Dai, Kai Li, Xu Li, Yanmeng Guo, Maosheng Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language model (VLM) has been designed for large scale image-text alignment as a pretrained foundation model. For downstream few shot classification tasks, parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) VLM has gained much popularity in the computer vision community. PEFT methods like prompt tuning and linear adapter have been studied for fine-tuning VLM while low rank adaptation (LoRA) algorithm has rarely been considered for few shot fine-tuning VLM. The main obstacle to use LoRA for few shot fine-tuning is the catastrophic forgetting problem. Because the visual language alignment knowledge is important for the generality in few shot learning, whereas low rank adaptation interferes with the most informative direction of the pretrained weight matrix. We propose the complementary subspace low rank adaptation (Comp-LoRA) method to regularize the catastrophic forgetting problem in few shot VLM finetuning. In detail, we optimize the low rank matrix in the complementary subspace, thus preserving the general vision language alignment ability of VLM when learning the novel few shot information. We conduct comparison experiments of the proposed Comp-LoRA method and other PEFT methods on fine-tuning VLM for few shot classification. And we also present the suppression on the catastrophic forgetting problem of our proposed method against directly applying LoRA to VLM. The results show that the proposed method surpasses the baseline method by about +1.0\% Top-1 accuracy and preserves the VLM zero-shot performance over the baseline method by about +1.3\% Top-1 accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kerui Chen, Zhiliang Wu, Wenjin Hou, Kun Li, Hehe Fan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore the image content in shadowed regions. While deep learning-based methods have shown promising results, they still face key challenges: 1) uncontrolled removal of all shadows, or 2) controllable removal but heavily relies on precise shadow region masks.To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm: prompt-aware controllable shadow removal. Unlike existing approaches, our paradigm allows for targeted shadow removal from specific subjects based on user prompts (e.g., dots, lines, or subject masks). This approach eliminates the need for shadow annotations and offers flexible, user-controlled shadow removal.Specifically, we propose an end-to-end learnable model, the \emph{\textbf{P}}rompt-\emph{\textbf{A}}ware \emph{\textbf{C}}ntrollable \emph{\textbf{S}}hadow \emph{\textbf{R}}emoval \emph{\textbf{Net}}work (PACSRNet). PACSRNet consists of two key modules: a prompt-aware module that generates shadow masks for the specified subject based on the user prompt, and a shadow removal module that uses the shadow prior from the first module to restore the content in the shadowed regions.Additionally, we enhance the shadow removal module by incorporating feature information from the prompt-aware module through a linear operation, providing prompt-guided support for shadow removal.Recognizing that existing shadow removal datasets lack diverse user prompts, we contribute a new dataset specifically designed for prompt-based controllable shadow removal.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of PACSRNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengshi Qi, Xiaoyang Bi, Pengfei Zhu, Huadong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustly predicting attention regions of interest for self-driving systems is crucial for driving safety but presents significant challenges due to the labor-intensive nature of obtaining large-scale attention labels and the domain gap between self-driving scenarios and natural scenes. These challenges are further exacerbated by complex traffic environments, including camera corruption under adverse weather, noise interferences, and central bias from long-tail distributions. To address these issues, we propose a robust unsupervised attention prediction method. An Uncertainty Mining Branch refines predictions by analyzing commonalities and differences across multiple pre-trained models on natural scenes, while a Knowledge Embedding Block bridges the domain gap by incorporating driving knowledge to adaptively enhance pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce RoboMixup, a novel data augmentation method that improves robustness against corruption through soft attention and dynamic augmentation, and mitigates central bias by integrating random cropping into Mixup as a regularizer.To systematically evaluate robustness in self-driving attention prediction, we introduce the DriverAttention-C benchmark, comprising over 100k frames across three subsets: BDD-A-C, DR(eye)VE-C, and DADA-2000-C. Our method achieves performance equivalent to or surpassing fully supervised state-of-the-art approaches on three public datasets and the proposed robustness benchmark, reducing relative corruption degradation by 58.8% and 52.8%, and improving central bias robustness by 12.4% and 11.4% in KLD and CC metrics, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shounak Datta, Dhanasekar Sundararaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on multi-modal tasks, large vision-language models (LVLMs) tend to suffer from hallucinations. An important type is object hallucination, where LVLMs generate objects that are inconsistent with the images shown to the model. Existing works typically attempt to quantify object hallucinations by detecting and measuring the fraction of hallucinated objects in generated captions. Additionally, more recent work also measures object hallucinations by directly querying the LVLM with binary questions about the presence of likely hallucinated objects based on object statistics like top-k frequent objects and top-k co-occurring objects. In this paper, we present Context-Aware Object Similarities (CAOS), a novel approach for evaluating object hallucination in LVLMs using object statistics as well as the generated captions. CAOS uniquely integrates object statistics with semantic relationships between objects in captions and ground-truth data. Moreover, existing approaches usually only detect and measure hallucinations belonging to a predetermined set of in-domain objects (typically the set of all ground-truth objects for the training dataset) and ignore generated objects that are not part of this set, leading to under-evaluation. To address this, we further employ language model--based object recognition to detect potentially out-of-domain hallucinated objects and use an ensemble of LVLMs for verifying the presence of such objects in the query image. CAOS also examines the sequential dynamics of object generation, shedding light on how the order of object appearance influences hallucinations, and employs word embedding models to analyze the semantic reasons behind hallucinations. CAOS aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the hallucination tendencies of LVLMs by providing a systematic framework to identify and interpret object hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingjun Luo, Jinpeng Wang, Wang Zewen, Junjie Zhu, Xibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video surveillance systems are crucial components for ensuring public safety and management in smart city. As a fundamental task in video surveillance, text-to-image person retrieval aims to retrieve the target person from an image gallery that best matches the given text description. Most existing text-to-image person retrieval methods are trained in a supervised manner that requires sufficient labeled data in the target domain. However, it is common in practice that only unlabeled data is available in the target domain due to the difficulty and cost of data annotation, which limits the generalization of existing methods in practical application scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, termed Graph-Based Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation (GCKD), to learn the cross-modal feature representation for text-to-image person retrieval in a cross-dataset scenario. The proposed GCKD method consists of two main components. Firstly, a graph-based multi-modal propagation module is designed to bridge the cross-domain correlation among the visual and textual samples. Secondly, a contrastive momentum knowledge distillation module is proposed to learn the cross-modal feature representation using the online knowledge distillation strategy. By jointly optimizing the two modules, the proposed method is able to achieve efficient performance for cross-dataset text-to-image person retrieval. acExtensive experiments on three publicly available text-to-image person retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCKD method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Jiang, Yixing Chen, Xingyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion synthesis plays a vital role in various fields of artificial intelligence. Among the various conditions of motion generation, text can describe motion details elaborately and is easy to acquire, making text-to-motion(T2M) generation important. State-of-the-art T2M techniques mainly leverage diffusion models to generate motions with text prompts as guidance, tackling the many-to-many nature of T2M tasks. However, existing T2M approaches face challenges, given the gap between the natural language domain and the physical domain, making it difficult to generate motions fully consistent with the texts.
  We leverage kinematic phrases(KP), an intermediate representation that bridges these two modalities, to solve this. Our proposed method, KETA, decomposes the given text into several decomposed texts via a language model. It trains an aligner to align decomposed texts with the KP segments extracted from the generated motions. Thus, it's possible to restrict the behaviors for diffusion-based T2M models. During the training stage, we deploy the text-KP alignment loss as an auxiliary goal to supervise the models. During the inference stage, we refine our generated motions for multiple rounds in our decoder structure, where we compute the text-KP distance as the guidance signal in each new round. Experiments demonstrate that KETA achieves up to 1.19x, 2.34x better R precision and FID value on both backbones of the base model, motion diffusion model. Compared to a wide range of T2M generation models. KETA achieves either the best or the second-best performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Meng, Yadan Luo, Xin Li, Dongmei Jiang, Zheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a promising alternative to softmax-based attention, leveraging kernelized feature maps to reduce complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. However, the non-negative constraint on feature maps and the relaxed exponential function used in approximation lead to significant information loss compared to the original query-key dot products, resulting in less discriminative attention maps with higher entropy. To address the missing interactions driven by negative values in query-key pairs, we propose a polarity-aware linear attention mechanism that explicitly models both same-signed and opposite-signed query-key interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relational information. Furthermore, to restore the spiky properties of attention maps, we provide a theoretical analysis proving the existence of a class of element-wise functions (with positive first and second derivatives) that can reduce entropy in the attention distribution. For simplicity, and recognizing the distinct contributions of each dimension, we employ a learnable power function for rescaling, allowing strong and weak attention signals to be effectively separated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PolaFormer improves performance on various vision tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingying Jiao, Zhigang Wang, Sifan Wu, Shaojing Fan, Zhenguang Liu, Zhuoyue Xu, Zheqi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation in videos remains a challenge, largely due to the reliance on extensive manual annotation of large datasets, which is expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, existing approaches often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and overlook the complementary relationship between temporal pose heatmaps and visual features. To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Shukla, Nakul Sharma, Manish Gupta, Anand Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Writing comprehensive and accurate descriptions of technical drawings in patent documents is crucial to effective knowledge sharing and enabling the replication and protection of intellectual property. However, automation of this task has been largely overlooked by the research community. To this end, we introduce PatentDesc-355K, a novel large-scale dataset containing ~355K patent figures along with their brief and detailed textual descriptions extracted from more than 60K US patent documents. In addition, we propose PatentLMM - a novel multimodal large language model specifically tailored to generate high-quality descriptions of patent figures. Our proposed PatentLMM comprises two key components: (i) PatentMME, a specialized multimodal vision encoder that captures the unique structural elements of patent figures, and (ii) PatentLLaMA, a domain-adapted version of LLaMA fine-tuned on a large collection of patents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training a vision encoder specifically designed for patent figures significantly boosts the performance, generating coherent descriptions compared to fine-tuning similar-sized off-the-shelf multimodal models. PatentDesc-355K and PatentLMM pave the way for automating the understanding of patent figures, enabling efficient knowledge sharing and faster drafting of patent documents. We make the code and data publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen-Hui Dong, Sheng Ye, Yu-Hui Wen, Nannan Li, Yong-Jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation due to its efficiency and high-fidelity rendering. However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengdong Zhang, Xiaoqin Zhang, Wenqi Ren, Linlin Shen, Shaohua Wan, Jun Zhang, Yujing M Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring a stable power supply in rural areas relies heavily on effective inspection of power equipment, particularly transmission lines (TLs). However, detecting TLs from aerial imagery can be challenging when dealing with misalignments between visible light (RGB) and infrared (IR) images, as well as mismatched high- and low-level features in convolutional networks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Multi-Modal Enhancement Network (HMMEN) that integrates RGB and IR data for robust and accurate TL detection. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Mutual Multi-Modal Enhanced Block (MMEB), which fuses and enhances hierarchical RGB and IR feature maps in a coarse-to-fine manner, and (2) a Feature Alignment Block (FAB) that corrects misalignments between decoder outputs and IR feature maps by leveraging deformable convolutions. We employ MobileNet-based encoders for both RGB and IR inputs to accommodate edge-computing constraints and reduce computational overhead. Experimental results on diverse weather and lighting conditionsfog, night, snow, and daytimedemonstrate the superiority and robustness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, resulting in fewer false positives, enhanced boundary delineation, and better overall detection performance. This framework thus shows promise for practical large-scale power line inspections with unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>

<p>Abstract: In human-centric scenes, the ability to simultaneously understand visual and auditory information is crucial. While recent omni models can process multiple modalities, they generally lack effectiveness in human-centric scenes due to the absence of large-scale, specialized datasets and non-targeted architectures. In this work, we developed HumanOmni, the industry's first human-centric Omni-multimodal large language model. We constructed a dataset containing over 2.4 million human-centric video clips with detailed captions and more than 14 million instructions, facilitating the understanding of diverse human-centric scenes. HumanOmni includes three specialized branches for understanding different types of scenes. It adaptively fuses features from these branches based on user instructions, significantly enhancing visual understanding in scenes centered around individuals. Moreover, HumanOmni integrates audio features to ensure a comprehensive understanding of environments and individuals. Our experiments validate HumanOmni's advanced capabilities in handling human-centric scenes across a variety of tasks, including emotion recognition, facial expression description, and action understanding. Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Wang, Jiangtao Wen, Yuxing Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Video neural network (VNN) processing using the conventional pipeline first converts Bayer video information into human understandable RGB videos using image signal processing (ISP) on a pixel by pixel basis. Then, VNN processing is performed on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VNN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose an efficient VNN processing framework. Instead of using ISP, computer vision tasks are directly accomplished using Bayer pattern information. To accelerate VNN processing, motion estimation is introduced to find temporal redundancies in input video data so as to avoid repeated and unnecessary computations. Experiments show greater than 67\% computation reduction, while maintaining computer vision task accuracy for typical computer vision tasks and data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengpu Pan, Jiangtao Wen, Yuxing Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising technique for capturing high-speed video at low bandwidth and low power, typically by compressing multiple frames into a single measurement. However, similar to traditional CMOS image sensor based imaging systems, SCI also faces challenges in low-lighting photon-limited and low-signal-to-noise-ratio image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressive Denoising Autoencoder (CompDAE) using the STFormer architecture as the backbone, to explicitly model noise characteristics and provide computer vision functionalities such as edge detection and depth estimation directly from compressed sensing measurements, while accounting for realistic low-photon conditions. We evaluate the effectiveness of CompDAE across various datasets and demonstrated significant improvements in task performance compared to conventional RGB-based methods. In the case of ultra-low-lighting (APC $\leq$ 20) while conventional methods failed, the proposed algorithm can still maintain competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hulingxiao He, Geng Li, Zijun Geng, Jinglin Xu, Yuxin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in various visual understanding tasks. However, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), which aims to identify subordinate-level categories from images. This can negatively impact more advanced capabilities of MLLMs, such as object-centric visual question answering and reasoning. In our study, we revisit three quintessential capabilities of MLLMs for FGVR, including object information extraction, category knowledge reserve, object-category alignment, and position of the root cause as a misalignment problem. To address this issue, we present Finedefics, an MLLM that enhances the model's FGVR capability by incorporating informative attribute descriptions of objects into the training phase. We employ contrastive learning on object-attribute pairs and attribute-category pairs simultaneously and use examples from similar but incorrect categories as hard negatives, naturally bringing representations of visual objects and category names closer. Extensive evaluations across multiple popular FGVR datasets demonstrate that Finedefics outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy.

<p>Abstract: This work investigates the capabilities of current vision-language models (VLMs) in visual understanding and attribute measurement of primitive shapes using a benchmark focused on controlled 2D shape configurations with variations in spatial positioning, occlusion, rotation, size, and shape attributes such as type, quadrant, center-coordinates, rotation, occlusion status, and color as shown in Figure 1 and supplementary Figures S3-S81. We fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs (2B-8B parameters) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and validate them on multiple out-of-domain (OD) scenarios from our proposed benchmark. Our findings reveal that coherent sentence-based outputs outperform tuple formats, particularly in OD scenarios with large domain gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that scaling numeric tokens during loss computation enhances numerical approximation capabilities, further improving performance on spatial and measurement tasks. These results highlight the importance of output format design, loss scaling strategies, and robust generalization techniques in enhancing the training and fine-tuning of VLMs, particularly for tasks requiring precise spatial approximations and strong OD generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the third generation of neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained widespread attention due to their low energy consumption and biological interpretability. Recently, SNNs have made considerable advancements in computer vision. However, efficiently conducting feature extraction and fusion under the spiking characteristics of SNNs for object detection remains a pressing challenge. To address this problem, we propose the SpikSSD, a novel Spiking Single Shot Multibox Detector. Specifically, we design a full-spiking backbone network, MDS-ResNet, which effectively adjusts the membrane synaptic input distribution at each layer, achieving better spiking feature extraction. Additionally, for spiking feature fusion, we introduce the Spiking Bi-direction Fusion Module (SBFM), which for the first time realizes bi-direction fusion of spiking features, enhancing the multi-scale detection capability of the model. Experimental results show that SpikSSD achieves 40.8\% mAP on the GEN1 dataset, 76.3\% and 52.4\% mAP@0.5 on VOC 2007 and COCO 2017 datasets respectively with the lowest firing rate, outperforming existing SNN-based approaches at ultralow energy consumption. This work sets a new benchmark for future research in SNN-based object detection. Our code is publicly available in https://github.com/yimeng-fan/SpikSSD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern image generation systems can produce high-quality visuals, yet user prompts often contain ambiguities, requiring multiple revisions. Existing methods struggle to address the nuanced needs of non-expert users. We propose Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA), a novel framework that iteratively refines prompts and aligns generated images with user preferences.

Key components include the Incremental Context-Enhanced Dialogue Block for interactive clarification, the Semantic Exploration and Disambiguation Module (SESD) leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and CLIP scoring, and the Pixel Precision and Consistency Optimization Module (PPCO) for refining image details using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). A human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism further improves performance. Experiments show that VCA surpasses models like DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, reducing dialogue rounds to 4.3, achieving a CLIP score of 0.92, and enhancing user satisfaction to 4.73/5.

<p>Abstract: Sign language pre-training has gained increasing attention for its ability to enhance performance across various sign language understanding (SLU) tasks. However, existing methods often suffer from a gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose \modelname, a unified pre-training framework that eliminates the gap between pre-training and downstream SLU tasks through a large-scale generative pre-training strategy and a novel fine-tuning paradigm. First, we introduce CSL-News, a large-scale Chinese Sign Language (CSL) dataset containing 1,985 hours of video paired with textual annotations, which enables effective large-scale pre-training. Second, \modelname unifies SLU tasks by treating downstream tasks as a single sign language translation (SLT) task during fine-tuning, ensuring seamless knowledge transfer between pre-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, we incorporate a prior-guided fusion (PGF) module and a score-aware sampling strategy to efficiently fuse pose and RGB information, addressing keypoint inaccuracies and improving computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple SLU benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream SLU tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Tang, Siyue Yu, Jian Pang, Bingfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training semantic segmenter with synthetic data has been attracting great attention due to its easy accessibility and huge quantities. Most previous methods focused on producing large-scale synthetic image-annotation samples and then training the segmenter with all of them. However, such a solution remains a main challenge in that the poor-quality samples are unavoidable, and using them to train the model will damage the training process. In this paper, we propose a training-free Synthetic Data Selection (SDS) strategy with CLIP to select high-quality samples for building a reliable synthetic dataset. Specifically, given massive synthetic image-annotation pairs, we first design a Perturbation-based CLIP Similarity (PCS) to measure the reliability of synthetic image, thus removing samples with low-quality images. Then we propose a class-balance Annotation Similarity Filter (ASF) by comparing the synthetic annotation with the response of CLIP to remove the samples related to low-quality annotations. The experimental results show that using our method significantly reduces the data size by half, while the trained segmenter achieves higher performance.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15211">&quot;Stones from Other Hills can Polish Jade&quot;: Zero-shot Anomaly Image Synthesis via Cross-domain Anomaly Injection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Wang, Yuanze Hu, Xinwang Liu, Siwei Wang, Guangpu Wang, Chuanfu Xu, Jie Liu, Ping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is a pivotal topic with huge value. Due to anomaly's nature, real anomalies in a specific modern industrial domain (i.e. domain-specific anomalies) are usually too rare to collect, which severely hinders IAD. Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which synthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges as a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to synthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we focus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic and training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although domain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e. cross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS. Specifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we propose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which directly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a training-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain anomalies, we build the first domain-agnostic anomaly dataset within our best knowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we propose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity limit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis. Our head-to-head comparison with existing ZSAS solutions justifies our paradigm's superior performance for IAD and demonstrates it as an effective and pragmatic ZSAS solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueying Tian, Elif Ucurum, Xudong Han, Rupert Young, Chris Chatwin, Philip Birch</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in medical diagnosis, especially for fetal health assessment. However, the availability of high-quality annotated ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Yan, Ziqiang Li, Ziwen He, Zhangjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of GANs and diffusion models has led to the generation of increasingly realistic fake images, posing significant hidden dangers and threats to society. Consequently, deepfake detection has become a pressing issue in today's world. While some existing methods focus on forgery features from either a local or global perspective, they often overlook the complementary nature of these features. Other approaches attempt to incorporate both local and global features but rely on simplistic strategies, such as cropping, which fail to capture the intricate relationships between local features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that effectively combines local spatial-frequency domain features with global frequency domain information, capturing detailed and holistic forgery traces. Specifically, our method uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and sliding windows to tile forged features and leverages attention mechanisms to extract local spatial-frequency domain information. Simultaneously, the phase component of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is integrated with attention mechanisms to extract global frequency domain information, complementing the local features and ensuring the integrity of forgery detection. Comprehensive evaluations on open-world datasets generated by 34 distinct generative models demonstrate a significant improvement of 2.9% over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Qiao, Huy Q. Le, Apurba Adhikary, Choong Seon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to improve the robustness of a small global model while maintaining clean accuracy under adversarial attacks and non-IID challenges in federated learning. By leveraging the concise knowledge embedded in the class probabilities from a pre-trained model for both clean and adversarial image classification, we propose a Pre-trained Model-guided Adversarial Federated Learning (PM-AFL) training paradigm. This paradigm integrates vanilla mixture and adversarial mixture knowledge distillation to effectively balance accuracy and robustness while promoting local models to learn from diverse data. Specifically, for clean accuracy, we adopt a dual distillation strategy where the class probabilities of randomly paired images and their blended versions are aligned between the teacher model and the local models. For adversarial robustness, we use a similar distillation approach but replace clean samples on the local side with adversarial examples. Moreover, considering the bias between local and global models, we also incorporate a consistency regularization term to ensure that local adversarial predictions stay aligned with their corresponding global clean ones. These strategies collectively enable local models to absorb diverse knowledge from the teacher model while maintaining close alignment with the global model, thereby mitigating overfitting to local optima and enhancing the generalization of the global model. Experiments demonstrate that the PM-AFL-based paradigm outperforms other methods that integrate defense strategies by a notable margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianxi Mi, Pengcheng Yuan, Chunlei Ma, Jiedan Chen, Mingzhe Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Tea flowers play a crucial role in taxonomic research and hybrid breeding for the tea plant. Tea flowering consumes the plant's nutrients, and flower thinning can regulate carbon-nitrogen metabolism, enhancing the yield and quality of young shoots. As traditional methods of observing tea flower traits are labor-intensive and inaccurate, we propose an effective framework for tea flowering quantifying. In this study, a highly representative and diverse dataset was constructed by collecting flower images from 29 tea accessions. Based on this dataset, the TflosYOLO model was built on the YOLOv5 architecture and enhanced with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network, which is the first model to offer a viable solution for detecting tea flowers and predicting flower quantities. The TflosYOLO model achieved an mAP50 of 0.874, outperforming YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. Furthermore, this model was tested on 34 datasets encompassing 26 tea accessions, five flowering stages, various lighting conditions, and pruned/unpruned plants, demonstrating high generalization and robustness. The correlation coefficient ($ R^2 $) between the predicted and actual flower counts was 0.974. Additionally, the TFSC (Tea Flowering Stage Classification) model - a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed for automatic classification of the flowering stages. TFSC achieved an accuracy of 0.899. Dynamic analysis of flowering across 29 tea accessions in 2023 and 2024 was conducted, revealed significant variability in flower quantity and dynamics, with genetically similar accessions showing more consistent flowering patterns. This framework provides a solution for quantifying tea flowering, and can serve as a reference for precision horticulture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nora Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Dyslexia affects reading and writing skills across many languages. This work describes a new application of YOLO-based object detection to isolate and label handwriting patterns (Normal, Reversal, Corrected) within synthetic images that resemble real words. Individual letters are first collected, preprocessed into 32x32 samples, then assembled into larger synthetic 'words' to simulate realistic handwriting. Our YOLOv11 framework simultaneously localizes each letter and classifies it into one of three categories, reflecting key dyslexia traits. Empirically, we achieve near-perfect performance, with precision, recall, and F1 metrics typically exceeding 0.999. This surpasses earlier single-letter approaches that rely on conventional CNNs or transfer-learning classifiers (for example, MobileNet-based methods in Robaa et al. arXiv:2410.19821). Unlike simpler pipelines that consider each letter in isolation, our solution processes complete word images, resulting in more authentic representations of handwriting. Although relying on synthetic data raises concerns about domain gaps, these experiments highlight the promise of YOLO-based detection for faster and more interpretable dyslexia screening. Future work will expand to real-world handwriting, other languages, and deeper explainability methods to build confidence among educators, clinicians, and families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi-Song Liu, Chenhang He, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful framework for tackling ill-posed problems, with recent advancements extending their use to point cloud upsampling. Despite their potential, existing diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies as they map Gaussian noise to real point clouds, overlooking the geometric information inherent in sparse point clouds. To address these inefficiencies, we propose PUFM, a flow matching approach to directly map sparse point clouds to their high-fidelity dense counterparts. Our method first employs midpoint interpolation to sparse point clouds, resolving the density mismatch between sparse and dense point clouds. Since point clouds are unordered representations, we introduce a pre-alignment method based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) optimization to ensure coherent interpolation between sparse and dense point clouds, which enables a more stable learning path in flow matching. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior upsampling quality but with fewer sampling steps. Further experiments on ScanNet and KITTI also show that our approach generalizes well on RGB-D point clouds and LiDAR point clouds, making it more practical for real-world applications.</p>

Our scalable data generation pipeline gatherers to 2,200 surgical procedures and produces 3.6 million tag annotations across 2,066 unique surgical tags. Our experiments show that RASO achieves improvements of 2.9 mAP, 4.5 mAP, 10.6 mAP, and 7.2 mAP on four standard surgical benchmarks respectively in zero-shot settings, and surpasses state-of-the-art models in supervised surgical action recognition tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanyang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with a focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15370">Scaling Large Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Multimodal Comprehension In Biomedical Image Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Robinson Umeike, Neil Getty, Fangfang Xia, Rick Stevens</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in understanding textual data and are increasingly being adopted to help researchers accelerate scientific discovery through knowledge extraction (information retrieval), knowledge distillation (summarizing key findings and methodologies into concise forms), and knowledge synthesis (aggregating information from multiple scientific sources to address complex queries, generate hypothesis and formulate experimental plans). However, scientific data often exists in both visual and textual modalities. Vision language models (VLMs) address this by incorporating a pretrained vision backbone for processing images and a cross-modal projector that adapts image tokens into the LLM dimensional space, thereby providing richer multimodal comprehension. Nevertheless, off-the-shelf VLMs show limited capabilities in handling domain-specific data and are prone to hallucinations. We developed intelligent assistants finetuned from LLaVA models to enhance multimodal understanding in low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT)-a benign approach used in the treatment of cancer-related illnesses. Using multilingual data from 42,673 articles, we devise complex reasoning and detailed description tasks for visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks. Our assistants, trained on 50,882 image-text pairs, demonstrate superior performance over base models as evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge approach, particularly in reducing hallucination and improving domain-specific comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Most, Jonas Hein, Fr\'ed\'eric Giraud, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Lukas Zingg, Baptiste Brument, Nino Louman, Fabio Carrillo, Philipp F\"urnstahl, Lilian Calvet</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in computer vision, particularly in optical image-based 3D reconstruction and feature matching, enable applications like marker-less surgical navigation and digitization of surgery. However, their development is hindered by a lack of suitable datasets with 3D ground truth. This work explores an approach to generating realistic and accurate ex vivo datasets tailored for 3D reconstruction and feature matching in open orthopedic surgery.
  A set of posed images and an accurately registered ground truth surface mesh of the scene are required to develop vision-based 3D reconstruction and matching methods suitable for surgery. We propose a framework consisting of three core steps and compare different methods for each step: 3D scanning, calibration of viewpoints for a set of high-resolution RGB images, and an optical-based method for scene registration.
  We evaluate each step of this framework on an ex vivo scoliosis surgery using a pig spine, conducted under real operating room conditions. A mean 3D Euclidean error of 0.35 mm is achieved with respect to the 3D ground truth.
  The proposed method results in submillimeter accurate 3D ground truths and surgical images with a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm. This opens the door to acquiring future surgical datasets for high-precision applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Akbarian Bafghi, Carden Bagwell, Avinash Ravichandran, Ashish Shrivastava, Maziar Raissi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting deep learning models to new domains often requires computationally intensive retraining and risks catastrophic forgetting. While fine-tuning enables domain-specific adaptation, it can reduce robustness to distribution shifts, impacting out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Pre-trained zero-shot models like CLIP offer strong generalization but may suffer degraded robustness after fine-tuning. Building on Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), we propose a simple yet effective extension as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, using an indicator function to selectively activate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) blocks. Our approach minimizes knowledge loss, retains its generalization strengths under domain shifts, and significantly reduces computational costs compared to traditional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that effective fine-tuning can be achieved with as few as 5\% of active blocks, substantially improving efficiency. Evaluations on pre-trained models such as CLIP and DINO-ViT demonstrate our method's broad applicability and effectiveness in maintaining performance and knowledge retention.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving perception. Fusion of 4D radar and camera provides a potential solution of robust occupancy prediction on serve weather with least cost. How to achieve effective multi-modal feature fusion and reduce annotation costs remains significant challenges. In this work, we propose MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that fuses surround-view cameras and 4D radar for comprehensive environmental perception. We first design a height self-attention module for effective 3D feature extraction from sparse radar points. Then, a local-global fusion mechanism is proposed to adaptively capture modality contributions while handling spatio-temporal misalignments. Temporal alignment and fusion module is employed to further aggregate historical feature. Furthermore, we develop a semi-supervised training procedure leveraging open-set segmentor and geometric constraints for pseudo-label generation, enabling robust perception with limited annotations. Extensive experiments on OmniHD-Scenes dataset demonstrate that MetaOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by significant margins. Notably, as the first semi-supervised 4D radar and camera fusion-based occupancy prediction approach, MetaOcc maintains 92.5% of the fully-supervised performance while using only 50% of ground truth annotations, establishing a new benchmark for multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction.

<p>Abstract: Cloud segmentation amounts to separating cloud pixels from non-cloud pixels in an image. Current deep learning methods for cloud segmentation suffer from three issues. (a) Constrain on their receptive field due to the fixed size of the convolution kernel. (b) Lack of robustness towards different scenarios. (c) Requirement of a large number of parameters and limitations for real-time implementation. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Dynamic U-Net (DDUNet) for supervised cloud segmentation. The DDUNet adheres to a U-Net architecture and integrates two crucial modules: the dynamic multi-scale convolution (DMSC), improving merging features under different reception fields, and the dynamic weights and bias generator (DWBG) in classification layers to enhance generalization ability. More importantly, owing to the use of depth-wise convolution, the DDUNet is a lightweight network that can achieve 95.3% accuracy on the SWINySEG dataset with only 0.33M parameters, and achieve superior performance over three different configurations of the SWINySEg dataset in both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijie Li, Hewei Wang, Jinfeng Xu, Zixiao Ma, Puzhen Wu, Shaofan Wang, Soumyabrata Dev</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image segmentation is pivotal for earth observation, underpinning applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. Due to the limited annotation data available in remote sensing images, numerous studies have focused on data augmentation as a means to alleviate overfitting in deep learning networks. However, some existing data augmentation strategies rely on simple transformations that may not sufficiently enhance data diversity or model generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a novel augmentation strategy, Clustered-Patch-Mixed Mosaic (CP2M), designed to address these limitations. CP2M integrates a Mosaic augmentation phase with a clustered patch mix phase. The former stage constructs a new sample from four random samples, while the latter phase uses the connected component labeling algorithm to ensure the augmented data maintains spatial coherence and avoids introducing irrelevant semantics when pasting random patches. Our experiments on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset demonstrate that CP2M substantially mitigates overfitting, setting new benchmarks for segmentation accuracy and model robustness in remote sensing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D object detection and occupancy prediction are critical tasks in autonomous driving, attracting significant attention. Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhe Wang, Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Guoyin Wang, Tianwei Zhang, Jiwei Li, Eduard Hovy</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing face identity (FaceID) customization methods perform well but are limited to generating identical faces as the input, while in real-world applications, users often desire images of the same person but with variations, such as different expressions (e.g., smiling, angry) or angles (e.g., side profile). This limitation arises from the lack of datasets with controlled input-output facial variations, restricting models' ability to learn effective modifications.
  To address this issue, we propose CrossFaceID, the first large-scale, high-quality, and publicly available dataset specifically designed to improve the facial modification capabilities of FaceID customization models. Specifically, CrossFaceID consists of 40,000 text-image pairs from approximately 2,000 persons, with each person represented by around 20 images showcasing diverse facial attributes such as poses, expressions, angles, and adornments. During the training stage, a specific face of a person is used as input, and the FaceID customization model is forced to generate another image of the same person but with altered facial features. This allows the FaceID customization model to acquire the ability to personalize and modify known facial features during the inference stage. Experiments show that models fine-tuned on the CrossFaceID dataset retain its performance in preserving FaceID fidelity while significantly improving its face customization capabilities.
  To facilitate further advancements in the FaceID customization field, our code, constructed datasets, and trained models are fully available to the public.</p>

<p>Abstract: CutMix is a data augmentation strategy that cuts and pastes image patches to mixup training data. Existing methods pick either random or salient areas which are often inconsistent to labels, thus misguiding the training model. By our knowledge, we integrate human gaze to guide cutmix for the first time. Since human attention is driven by both high-level recognition and low-level clues, we propose a controllable Top-down Attention Guided Module to obtain a general artificial attention which balances top-down and bottom-up attention. The proposed TdATttenMix then picks the patches and adjust the label mixing ratio that focuses on regions relevant to the current label. Experimental results demonstrate that our TdAttenMix outperforms existing state-of-the-art mixup methods across eight different benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a new metric based on the human gaze and use this metric to investigate the issue of image-label inconsistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Fan, Yuguang Xie, Bowen Cai, Ailin Xie, Gaochao Liu, Mu Qiao, Jie Xing, Zaiqing Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the chemical structure from a graphical representation of a molecule is a challenging image caption task that would greatly benefit molecule-centric scientific discovery. Variations in molecular images and caption subtasks pose a significant challenge in both image representation learning and task modeling. Yet, existing methods only focus on a specific caption task that translates a molecular image into its graph structure, i.e., OCSR. In this paper, we propose the Optical Chemical Structure Understanding (OCSU) task, which extends OCSR to molecular image caption from motif level to molecule level and abstract level. We present two approaches for that, including an OCSR-based method and an end-to-end OCSR-free method. The proposed Double-Check achieves SOTA OCSR performance on real-world patent and journal article scenarios via attentive feature enhancement for local ambiguous atoms. Cascading with SMILES-based molecule understanding methods, it can leverage the power of existing task-specific models for OCSU. While Mol-VL is an end-to-end optimized VLM-based model. An OCSU dataset, Vis-CheBI20, is built based on the widely used CheBI20 dataset for training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results on Vis-CheBI20 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Improving OCSR capability can lead to a better OCSU performance for OCSR-based approach, and the SOTA performance of Mol-VL demonstrates the great potential of end-to-end approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayu Chen, Kai Jiang, Kaiwen Zheng, Jianfei Chen, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utku Ozbulak, Esla Timothy Anzaku, Solha Kang, Wesley De Neve, Joris Vankerschaver</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) research strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of newly proposed models. Recently, a number of prominent research effort argued that a number of models that improve the state-of-the-art by a small margin tend to do so by winning what they call a "benchmark lottery". An important benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision is the ImageNet where newly proposed models are often showcased based on their performance on this dataset. Given the large number of self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks that has been proposed in the past couple of years each coming with marginal improvements on the ImageNet dataset, in this work, we evaluate whether those marginal improvements on ImageNet translate to improvements on similar datasets or not. To do so, we investigate twelve popular SSL frameworks on five ImageNet variants and discover that models that seem to perform well on ImageNet may experience significant performance declines on similar datasets. Specifically, state-of-the-art frameworks such as DINO and Swav, which are praised for their performance, exhibit substantial drops in performance while MoCo and Barlow Twins displays comparatively good results. As a result, we argue that otherwise good and desirable properties of models remain hidden when benchmarking is only performed on the ImageNet validation set, making us call for more adequate benchmarking. To avoid the "benchmark lottery" on ImageNet and to ensure a fair benchmarking process, we investigate the usage of a unified metric that takes into account the performance of models on other ImageNet variant datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Mirzaei, Mojtaba Nafez, Jafar Habibi, Mohammad Sabokrou, Mohammad Hossein Rohban</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in Anomaly Detection (AD), the robustness of existing detection methods against adversarial attacks remains a challenge, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving. This issue primarily arises from the AD setup, which assumes that training data is limited to a group of unlabeled normal samples, making the detectors vulnerable to adversarial anomaly samples during testing. Additionally, implementing adversarial training as a safeguard encounters difficulties, such as formulating an effective objective function without access to labels. An ideal objective function for adversarial training in AD should promote strong perturbations both within and between the normal and anomaly groups to maximize margin between normal and anomaly distribution. To address these issues, we first propose crafting a pseudo-anomaly group derived from normal group samples. Then, we demonstrate that adversarial training with contrastive loss could serve as an ideal objective function, as it creates both inter- and intra-group perturbations. However, we notice that spurious negative pairs compromise the conventional contrastive loss to achieve robust AD. Spurious negative pairs are those that should be closely mapped but are erroneously separated. These pairs introduce noise and misguide the direction of inter-group adversarial perturbations. To overcome the effect of spurious negative pairs, we define opposite pairs and adversarially pull them apart to strengthen inter-group perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance in both clean and adversarial scenarios, with a 26.1% improvement in robust detection across various challenging benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Rui Yang Tan, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting hate speech in online content is essential to ensuring safer digital spaces. While significant progress has been made in text and meme modalities, video-based hate speech detection remains under-explored, hindered by a lack of annotated datasets and the high cost of video annotation. This gap is particularly problematic given the growing reliance on large models, which demand substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, we leverage meme datasets as both a substitution and an augmentation strategy for training hateful video detection models. Our approach introduces a human-assisted reannotation pipeline to align meme dataset labels with video datasets, ensuring consistency with minimal labeling effort. Using two state-of-the-art vision-language models, we demonstrate that meme data can substitute for video data in resource-scarce scenarios and augment video datasets to achieve further performance gains. Our results consistently outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks, showcasing the potential of cross-modal transfer learning for advancing hateful video detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Panangian, Ksenia Bittner</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Surface Models (DSMs) are essential for accurately representing Earth's topography in geospatial analyses. DSMs capture detailed elevations of natural and manmade features, crucial for applications like urban planning, vegetation studies, and 3D reconstruction. However, DSMs derived from stereo satellite imagery often contain voids or missing data due to occlusions, shadows, and lowsignal areas. Previous studies have primarily focused on void filling for digital elevation models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), employing methods such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation. While effective for simpler terrains, these approaches often fail to handle the intricate structures present in DSMs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dfilled, a guided DSM void filling method that leverages optical remote sensing images through edge-enhancing diffusion. Dfilled repurposes deep anisotropic diffusion models, which originally designed for super-resolution tasks, to inpaint DSMs. Additionally, we utilize Perlin noise to create inpainting masks that mimic natural void patterns in DSMs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dfilled surpasses traditional interpolation methods and deep learning approaches in DSM void filling tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the method's ability to manage complex features and deliver accurate, visually coherent results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Gao, Jia Li, Huaibo Huang, Ke Shang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) is a highly challenging problem due to the uncertainty of data degradation patterns. Current BFR methods have realized certain restored productions but with inherent neural degradations that limit real-world generalization in complicated scenarios. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework InfoBFR to tackle neural degradations, e.g., prior bias, topological distortion, textural distortion, and artifact residues, which achieves high-generalization face restoration in diverse wild and heterogeneous scenes. Specifically, based on the results from pre-trained BFR models, InfoBFR considers information compression using manifold information bottleneck (MIB) and information compensation with efficient diffusion LoRA to conduct information optimization. InfoBFR effectively synthesizes high-fidelity faces without attribute and identity distortions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of InfoBFR over state-of-the-art GAN-based and diffusion-based BFR methods, with around 70ms consumption, 16M trainable parameters, and nearly 85% BFR-boosting. It is promising that InfoBFR will be the first plug-and-play restorer universally employed by diverse BFR models to conquer neural degradations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongmin Yeo, Jaihoon Kim, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for generating images in arbitrary spaces (e.g., a sphere for 360{\deg} panoramas and a mesh surface for texture) using a pretrained image diffusion model. The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Fan, Steve Dai, Rangharajan Venkatesan, Dennis Sylvester, Brucek Khailany</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have gained significant popularity in image generation tasks. However, generating high-quality content remains notably slow because it requires running model inference over many time steps. To accelerate these models, we propose to aggressively quantize both weights and activations, while simultaneously promoting significant activation sparsity. We further observe that the stated sparsity pattern varies among different channels and evolves across time steps. To support this quantization and sparsity scheme, we present a novel diffusion model accelerator featuring a heterogeneous mixed-precision dense-sparse architecture, channel-last address mapping, and a time-step-aware sparsity detector for efficient handling of the sparsity pattern. Our 4-bit quantization technique demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing 4-bit methods. Our custom accelerator achieves 6.91x speed-up and 51.5% energy reduction compared to traditional dense accelerators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengran Wang, Yanan Zhang, Jiaxin Chen, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the annotation burden in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, active learning (AL) methods offer a promising solution. However, traditional active learning approaches solely rely on a small amount of labeled data to train an initial model for data selection, overlooking the potential of leveraging the abundance of unlabeled data. Recently, attempts to integrate semi-supervised learning (SSL) into AL with the goal of leveraging unlabeled data have faced challenges in effectively resolving the conflict between the two paradigms, resulting in less satisfactory performance. To tackle this conflict, we propose a Synergistic Semi-Supervised Active Learning framework, dubbed as S-SSAL. Specifically, from the perspective of SSL, we propose a Collaborative PseudoScene Pre-training (CPSP) method that effectively learns from unlabeled data without introducing adverse effects. From the perspective of AL, we design a Collaborative Active Learning (CAL) method, which complements the uncertainty and diversity methods by model cascading. This allows us to fully exploit the potential of the CPSP pre-trained model. Extensive experiments conducted on KITTI and Waymo demonstrate the effectiveness of our S-SSAL framework. Notably, on the KITTI dataset, utilizing only 2% labeled data, S-SSAL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Solha Kang, Joris Vankerschaver, Utku Ozbulak</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), transformer-based computer vision models have recently demonstrated superior results compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and are poised to dominate the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical imaging in the upcoming years. Nevertheless, similar to CNNs, unveiling the decision-making process of transformer-based models remains a challenge. In this work, we take a step towards demystifying the decision-making process of transformer-based medical imaging models and propose Token Insight, a novel method that identifies the critical tokens that contribute to the prediction made by the model. Our method relies on the principled approach of token discarding native to transformer-based models, requires no additional module, and can be applied to any transformer model. Using the proposed approach, we quantify the importance of each token based on its contribution to the prediction and enable a more nuanced understanding of the model's decisions. Our experimental results which are showcased on the problem of colonic polyp identification using both supervised and self-supervised pretrained vision transformers indicate that Token Insight contributes to a more transparent and interpretable transformer-based medical imaging model, fostering trust and facilitating broader adoption in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Wang, Jingcai Guo, Depeng Li, Zhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-free class incremental learning (EF-CIL) is a nontrivial task that requires continuously enriching model capability with new classes while maintaining previously learned knowledge without storing and replaying any old class exemplars. An emerging theory-guided framework for CIL trains task-specific models for a shared network, shifting the pressure of forgetting to task-id prediction. In EF-CIL, task-id prediction is more challenging due to the lack of inter-task interaction (e.g., replays of exemplars). To address this issue, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the importance and feasibility of preserving a discriminative and consistent feature space, upon which we propose a novel method termed DCNet. Concretely, it progressively maps class representations into a hyperspherical space, in which different classes are orthogonally distributed to achieve ample inter-class separation. Meanwhile, it also introduces compensatory training to adaptively adjust supervision intensity, thereby aligning the degree of intra-class aggregation. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis verified the superiority of the proposed DCNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenkai Wu, Xiaowen Ma, Rongrong Lian, Kai Zheng, Mengting Ma, Wei Zhang, Siyang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba, with its advantages of global perception and linear complexity, has been widely applied to identify changes of the target regions within the remote sensing (RS) images captured under complex scenarios and varied conditions. However, existing remote sensing change detection (RSCD) approaches based on Mamba frequently struggle to effectively perceive the inherent locality of change regions as they direct flatten and scan RS images (i.e., the features of the same region of changes are not distributed continuously within the sequence but are mixed with features from other regions throughout the sequence). In this paper, we propose a novel locally adaptive SSM-based approach, termed CD-Lamba, which effectively enhances the locality of change detection while maintaining global perception. Specifically, our CD-Lamba includes a Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (LASS) strategy for locality enhancement, a Cross-Temporal State-Space Scan (CTSS) strategy for bi-temporal feature fusion, and a Window Shifting and Perception (WSP) mechanism to enhance interactions across segmented windows. These strategies are integrated into a multi-scale Cross-Temporal Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (CT-LASS) module to effectively highlight changes and refine changes' representations feature generation. CD-Lamba significantly enhances local-global spatio-temporal interactions in bi-temporal images, offering improved performance in RSCD tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CD-Lamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets with a satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

<p>Abstract: Reproducibility and replicability are critical pillars of empirical research, particularly in machine learning, where they depend not only on the availability of models, but also on the datasets used to train and evaluate those models. In this paper, we introduce the Construction Industry Steel Ordering List (CISOL) dataset, which was developed with a focus on transparency to ensure reproducibility, replicability, and extensibility. CISOL provides a valuable new research resource and highlights the importance of having diverse datasets, even in niche application domains such as table extraction in civil engineering.
  CISOL is unique in that it contains real-world civil engineering documents from industry, making it a distinctive contribution to the field. The dataset contains more than 120,000 annotated instances in over 800 document images, positioning it as a medium-sized dataset that provides a robust foundation for Table Structure Recognition (TSR) and Table Detection (TD) tasks.
  Benchmarking results show that CISOL achieves 67.22 mAP@0.5:0.95:0.05 using the YOLOv8 model, outperforming the TSR-specific TATR model. This highlights the effectiveness of CISOL as a benchmark for advancing TSR, especially in specialized domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein-based therapeutics play a pivotal role in modern medicine targeting various diseases. Despite their therapeutic importance, these products can aggregate and form subvisible particles (SvPs), which can compromise their efficacy and trigger immunological responses, emphasizing the critical need for robust monitoring techniques. Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) has been a significant advancement in detecting SvPs, evolving from monochrome to more recently incorporating color imaging. Complementing SvP images obtained via FIM, deep learning techniques have recently been employed successfully for stress source identification of monochrome SvPs. In this study, we explore the potential of color FIM to enhance the characterization of stress sources in SvPs. To achieve this, we curate a new dataset comprising 16,000 SvPs from eight commercial monoclonal antibodies subjected to heat and mechanical stress. Using both supervised and self-supervised convolutional neural networks, as well as vision transformers in large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that deep learning with color FIM images consistently outperforms monochrome images, thus highlighting the potential of color FIM in stress source classification compared to its monochrome counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JiaKui Hu, Lujia Jin, Zhengjian Yao, Yanye Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the Degradation Classification Pre-Training (DCPT), which enables models to learn how to classify the degradation type of input images for universal image restoration pre-training. Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Zheng, Yiyi Zhang, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation in visual emotion recognition (SFDA-VER) is a highly challenging task that requires adapting VER models to the target domain without relying on source data, which is of great significance for data privacy protection. However, due to the unignorable disparities between visual emotion data and traditional image classification data, existing SFDA methods perform poorly on this task. In this paper, we investigate the SFDA-VER task from a fuzzy perspective and identify two key issues: fuzzy emotion labels and fuzzy pseudo-labels. These issues arise from the inherent uncertainty of emotion annotations and the potential mispredictions in pseudo-labels. To address these issues, we propose a novel fuzzy-aware loss (FAL) to enable the VER model to better learn and adapt to new domains under fuzzy labels. Specifically, FAL modifies the standard cross entropy loss and focuses on adjusting the losses of non-predicted categories, which prevents a large number of uncertain or incorrect predictions from overwhelming the VER model during adaptation. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of FAL and prove its robustness in handling the noise in generated pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on 26 domain adaptation sub-tasks across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riddhasree Bhattacharyya, Surochita Pal Das, Sushmita Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Prostate cancer grading using the ISUP system (International Society of Urological Pathology) for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires considerable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems, few have handled efficient ISUP grading on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of prostate biopsies based only on slide-level labels. Some of the general challenges include managing gigapixel WSIs, obtaining patch-level annotations, and dealing with stain variability across centers. One of the main task-specific challenges faced by deep learning in ISUP grading, is the learning of patch-level features of Gleason patterns (GPs) based only on their slide labels. In this scenario, an efficient framework for ISUP grading is developed.
  The proposed TSOR is based on a novel Task-specific Self-supervised learning (SSL) model, which is fine-tuned using Ordinal Regression. Since the diversity of training samples plays a crucial role in SSL, a patch-level dataset is created to be relatively balanced w.r.t. the Gleason grades (GGs). This balanced dataset is used for pre-training, so that the model can effectively learn stain-agnostic features of the GP for better generalization. In medical image grading, it is desirable that misclassifications be as close as possible to the actual grade. From this perspective, the model is then fine-tuned for the task of ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach. Experimental results on the most extensive multicenter prostate biopsies dataset (PANDA challenge), as well as the SICAP dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15547">Building Efficient Lightweight CNN Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Isong</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are pivotal in image classification tasks due to their robust feature extraction capabilities. However, their high computational and memory requirements pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a methodology to construct lightweight CNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy. The approach integrates two stages of training; dual-input-output model and transfer learning with progressive unfreezing. The dual-input-output model train on original and augmented datasets, enhancing robustness. Progressive unfreezing is applied to the unified model to optimize pre-learned features during fine-tuning, enabling faster convergence and improved model accuracy.
  The methodology was evaluated on three benchmark datasets; handwritten digit MNIST, fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The proposed model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99% on the handwritten digit MNIST and 89% on fashion MNIST, with only 14,862 parameters and a model size of 0.17 MB. While performance on CIFAR-10 was comparatively lower (65% with less than 20,00 parameters), the results highlight the scalability of this method. The final model demonstrated fast inference times and low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
  Future directions include exploring advanced augmentation techniques, improving architectural scalability for complex datasets, and extending the methodology to tasks beyond classification. This research underscores the potential for creating efficient, scalable, and task-specific CNNs for diverse applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various domains, excelling in processing and understanding information from multiple modalities. Despite the rapid progress made previously, insufficient OCR ability hinders MLLMs from excelling in text-related tasks. In this paper, we present \textbf{Ocean-OCR}, a 3B MLLM with state-of-the-art performance on various OCR scenarios and comparable understanding ability on general tasks. We employ Native Resolution ViT to enable variable resolution input and utilize a substantial collection of high-quality OCR datasets to enhance the model performance. We demonstrate the superiority of Ocean-OCR through comprehensive experiments on open-source OCR benchmarks and across various OCR scenarios. These scenarios encompass document understanding, scene text recognition, and handwritten recognition, highlighting the robust OCR capabilities of Ocean-OCR. Note that Ocean-OCR is the first MLLM to outperform professional OCR models such as TextIn and PaddleOCR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang Tu, Qian Feng, Chufan Chen, Jiahua Dong, Hanbin Zhao, Chao Zhang, Hui Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative performance about various concepts. With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Nie, Sunan He, Yequan Bie, Yihui Wang, Zhixuan Chen, Shu Yang, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthiness is essential for the precise and interpretable application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging. Traditionally, precision and interpretability have been addressed as separate tasks, namely medical image analysis and explainable AI, each developing its own models independently. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the development of a unified medical vision-language pre-training model that can achieve both accurate analysis and interpretable understanding of medical images across various modalities. To build the model, we construct MedConcept-23M, a large-scale dataset comprising 23 million medical image-text pairs extracted from 6.2 million scientific articles, enriched with concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Based on MedConcept-23M, we introduce ConceptCLIP, a medical AI model utilizing concept-enhanced contrastive language-image pre-training. The pre-training of ConceptCLIP involves two primary components: image-text alignment learning (IT-Align) and patch-concept alignment learning (PC-Align). This dual alignment strategy enhances the model's capability to associate specific image regions with relevant concepts, thereby improving both the precision of analysis and the interpretability of the AI system. We conducted extensive experiments on 5 diverse types of medical image analysis tasks, spanning 51 subtasks across 10 image modalities, with the broadest range of downstream tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed vision-language pre-training model. Further explainability analysis across 6 modalities reveals that ConceptCLIP achieves superior performance, underscoring its robust ability to advance explainable AI in medical imaging. These findings highlight ConceptCLIP's capability in promoting trustworthy AI in the field of medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Fan, Weinong Wang, Xing Wu, Debing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called SedarEval, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. SedarEval consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach. We release our dataset at https://github.com/wwn1233/sedareval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuguang Wang, Yuanjing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Wang and Wang (2025) proposed the Task-Driven Fixation Network (TDFN) based on the fixation mechanism, which leverages low-resolution information along with high-resolution details near fixation points to accomplish specific visual tasks. The model employs reinforcement learning to generate fixation points. However, training reinforcement learning models is challenging, particularly when aiming to generate pixel-level accurate fixation points on high-resolution images. This paper introduces an improved fixation point generation method by leveraging the difference between the reconstructed image and the input image to train the fixation point generator. This approach directs fixation points to areas with significant differences between the reconstructed and input images. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves highly accurate fixation points, significantly enhances the network's classification accuracy, and reduces the average number of required fixations to achieve a predefined accuracy level.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given a pair of images depicting a person and a garment separately, image-based 3D virtual try-on methods aim to reconstruct a 3D human model that realistically portrays the person wearing the desired garment. In this paper, we present IPVTON, a novel image-based 3D virtual try-on framework. IPVTON employs score distillation sampling with image prompts to optimize a hybrid 3D human representation, integrating target garment features into diffusion priors through an image prompt adapter. To avoid interference with non-target areas, we leverage mask-guided image prompt embeddings to focus the image features on the try-on regions. Moreover, we impose geometric constraints on the 3D model with a pseudo silhouette generated by ControlNet, ensuring that the clothed 3D human model retains the shape of the source identity while accurately wearing the target garments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that IPVTON outperforms previous methods in image-based 3D virtual try-on tasks, excelling in both geometry and texture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Dong, Chengkun Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Lei Chen, Jiwen Lu, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective image tokenization is crucial for both multi-modal understanding and generation tasks due to the necessity of the alignment with discrete text data. To this end, existing approaches utilize vector quantization (VQ) to project pixels onto a discrete codebook and reconstruct images from the discrete representation. However, compared with the continuous latent space, the limited discrete codebook space significantly restrict the representational ability of these image tokenizers. In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer. Competitive reconstruction performances on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15641">Bringing Characters to New Stories: Training-Free Theme-Specific Image Generation via Dynamic Visual Prompting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Zhang, Minyan Luo, Weiming Dong, Xiao Yang, Haibin Huang, Chongyang Ma, Oliver Deussen, Tong-Yee Lee, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The stories and characters that captivate us as we grow up shape unique fantasy worlds, with images serving as the primary medium for visually experiencing these realms. Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning with theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image generation. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning specific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such as characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and continuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often come with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of overfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation models directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large language models use text as context? To address this, we present T-Prompter, a novel training-free TSI method for generation. T-Prompter introduces visual prompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models, allowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring additional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to improve the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables diverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design, realistic character generation, and style-guided image generation. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art personalization methods demonstrate that T-Prompter achieves significantly better results and excels in maintaining character identity preserving, style consistency and text alignment, offering a robust and flexible solution for theme-specific image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent pose-transfer methods aim to generate temporally consistent and fully controllable videos of human action where the motion from a reference video is reenacted by a new identity. We evaluate three state-of-the-art pose-transfer methods -- AnimateAnyone, MagicAnimate, and ExAvatar -- by generating videos with actions and identities outside the training distribution and conducting a participant study about the quality of these videos. In a controlled environment of 20 distinct human actions, we find that participants, presented with the pose-transferred videos, correctly identify the desired action only 42.92% of the time. Moreover, the participants find the actions in the generated videos consistent with the reference (source) videos only 36.46% of the time. These results vary by method: participants find the splatting-based ExAvatar more consistent and photorealistic than the diffusion-based AnimateAnyone and MagicAnimate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Shams, Ben Nassi, Satoru Koda, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhancing technique leveraging an inherent property of automatic pedestrian detection algorithms, namely, that the training of deep neural network (DNN) based methods is generally performed using curated datasets and laboratory settings, while the operational areas of these methods are dynamic real-world environments. In particular, we leverage a novel side effect of this gap between the laboratory and the real world: location-based weakness in pedestrian detection. We demonstrate that the position (distance, angle, height) of a person, and ambient light level, directly impact the confidence of a pedestrian detector when detecting the person. We then demonstrate that this phenomenon is present in pedestrian detectors observing a stationary scene of pedestrian traffic, with blind spot areas of weak detection of pedestrians with low confidence. We show how privacy-concerned pedestrians can leverage these blind spots to evade detection by constructing a minimum confidence path between two points in a scene, reducing the maximum confidence and average confidence of the path by up to 0.09 and 0.13, respectively, over direct and random paths through the scene. To counter this phenomenon, and force the use of more costly and sophisticated methods to leverage this vulnerability, we propose a novel countermeasure to improve the confidence of pedestrian detectors in blind spots, raising the max/average confidence of paths generated by our technique by 0.09 and 0.05, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate that our countermeasure improves a Faster R-CNN-based pedestrian detector's TPR and average true positive confidence by 0.03 and 0.15, respectively.</p>

This study explores the application of Swin Transformers, a state-of-the-art architecture leveraging shifted windows for self-attention, in detecting and classifying deepfake images.

Our results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer outperforms conventional CNN-based architectures, including VGG16, ResNet18, and AlexNet, achieving a test accuracy of 71.29\%. Additionally, we present insights into hybrid model design, highlighting the complementary strengths of transformer and CNN-based approaches in deepfake detection. This study underscores the potential of transformer-based architectures for improving accuracy and generalizability in image-based manipulation detection, paving the way for more effective countermeasures against deepfake threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aimee Guo, Weihua Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fiducial marker positions in projection image of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans have been studied to evaluate daily residual motion during breath-hold radiation therapy. Fiducial marker migration posed challenges in accurately locating markers, prompting the development of a novel algorithm that reconstructs volumetric probability maps of marker locations from filtered gradient maps of projections. This guides the development of a Python-based algorithm to detect fiducial markers in projection images using Meta AI's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). Retrospective data from a pancreatic cancer patient with two fiducial markers were analyzed. The three-dimensional (3D) marker positions from simulation computed tomography (CT) were compared to those reconstructed from CBCT images, revealing a decrease in relative distances between markers over time. Fiducial markers were successfully detected in 2777 out of 2786 projection frames. The average standard deviation of superior-inferior (SI) marker positions was 0.56 mm per breath-hold, with differences in average SI positions between two breath-holds in the same scan reaching up to 5.2 mm, and a gap of up to 7.3 mm between the end of the first and beginning of the second breath-hold. 3D marker positions were calculated using projection positions and confirmed marker migration. This method effectively calculates marker probability volume and enables accurate fiducial marker tracking during treatment without requiring any specialized equipment, additional radiation doses, or manual initialization and labeling. It has significant potential for automatically assessing daily residual motion to adjust planning margins, functioning as an adaptive radiation therapy tool.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric technique over large distances. State-of-the-art gait recognition systems perform very well in controlled environments at close range. Recently, there has been an increased interest in gait recognition in the wild prompted by the collection of outdoor, more challenging datasets containing variations in terms of illumination, pitch angles, and distances. An important problem in these environments is that of occlusion, where the subject is partially blocked from camera view. While important, this problem has received little attention. Thus, we propose MimicGait, a model-agnostic approach for gait recognition in the presence of occlusions. We train the network using a multi-instance correlational distillation loss to capture both inter-sequence and intra-sequence correlations in the occluded gait patterns of a subject, utilizing an auxiliary Visibility Estimation Network to guide the training of the proposed mimic network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging real-world datasets like GREW, Gait3D and BRIAR. We release the code in https://github.com/Ayush-00/mimicgait.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational pathology foundation models (CPathFMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing histopathological data, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust feature representations from unlabeled whole-slide images. These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p>

Recent such development was observed by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that suggested to challenge the fundamental concept of a Neural Network, thus change Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. They received a good reception in terms of scientific modeling, yet had some drawbacks in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we train Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (CKANs) with the ImageNet-1k dataset with 1.3 million images, MNIST dataset with 60k images and a tabular biological science related MoA dataset and test the promise of CKANs in terms of FLOPS, Inference Time, number of trainable parameters and training time against the accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 score they produce against the standard industry practice on CNN models. We show that the CKANs perform fair yet slower than CNNs in small size dataset like MoA and MNIST but are not nearly comparable as the dataset gets larger and more complex like the ImageNet.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialun Cai, Mengyuan Liu, Hong Liu, Wenhao Li, Shuheng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karam Park, Jae Woong Soh, Nam Ik Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)-based SR approaches due to their capability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their high computational complexity necessitates the development of lightweight approaches for practical use. To address this challenge, we propose the Attention-Sharing Information Distillation (ASID) network, a lightweight SR network that integrates attention-sharing and an information distillation structure specifically designed for Transformer-based SR methods. We modify the information distillation scheme, originally designed for efficient CNN operations, to reduce the computational load of stacked self-attention layers, effectively addressing the efficiency bottleneck. Additionally, we introduce attention-sharing across blocks to further minimize the computational cost of self-attention operations. By combining these strategies, ASID achieves competitive performance with existing SR methods while requiring only around 300K parameters - significantly fewer than existing CNN-based and Transformer-based SR models. Furthermore, ASID outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods when the number of parameters is matched, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness. The code and supplementary material are available on the project page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunbo Lyu, Zhou Yang, Yuqing Niu, Jing Jiang, David Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality images and are consequently used in a wide range of applications. However, there are concerns about the gender bias of these models. Previous studies have shown that T2I models can perpetuate or even amplify gender stereotypes when provided with neutral text prompts. Researchers have proposed automated gender bias uncovering detectors for T2I models, but a crucial gap exists: no existing work comprehensively compares the various detectors and understands how the gender bias detected by them deviates from the actual situation. This study addresses this gap by validating previous gender bias detectors using a manually labeled dataset and comparing how the bias identified by various detectors deviates from the actual bias in T2I models, as verified by manual confirmation. We create a dataset consisting of 6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. During the human-labeling process, we find that all three T2I models generate a portion (12.48% on average) of low-quality images (e.g., generate images with no face present), where human annotators cannot determine the gender of the person. Our analysis reveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images, with SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts containing professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most bias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture the actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias by up to 26.95%. We further investigate the causes of inaccurate estimations, highlighting the limitations of detectors in dealing with low-quality images. Based on our findings, we propose an enhanced detector...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiling Chen, Hanning Chen, Mohsen Imani, Farhad Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: In industrial settings, the accurate detection of anomalies is essential for maintaining product quality and ensuring operational safety. Traditional industrial anomaly detection (IAD) models often struggle with flexibility and adaptability, especially in dynamic production environments where new defect types and operational changes frequently arise. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations by combining visual and textual information processing capabilities. MLLMs excel in general visual understanding due to their training on large, diverse datasets, but they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as industry-specific defect tolerance levels, which limits their effectiveness in IAD tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Echo, a novel multi-expert framework designed to enhance MLLM performance for IAD. Echo integrates four expert modules: Reference Extractor which provides a contextual baseline by retrieving similar normal images, Knowledge Guide which supplies domain-specific insights, Reasoning Expert which enables structured, stepwise reasoning for complex queries, and Decision Maker which synthesizes information from all modules to deliver precise, context-aware responses. Evaluated on the MMAD benchmark, Echo demonstrates significant improvements in adaptability, precision, and robustness, moving closer to meeting the demands of real-world industrial anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Wu, Na Su, Chenran Zhang, Tengfei Ma, Tao Zhou, Zhiting Cui, Nianfeng Tang, Tianyu Mao, Yi Zhou, Wen Fan, Tianxing Wu, Shenqi Jing, Huazhu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has been investigated to generalize across diverse downstream tasks for fundus image analysis. Although recent methods showcase promising achievements, they significantly rely on large-scale private image-text data but pay less attention to the pretraining manner, which limits their further advancements. In this work, we introduce MM-Retinal V2, a high-quality image-text paired dataset comprising CFP, FFA, and OCT image modalities. Then, we propose a novel fundus vision-language pretraining model, namely KeepFIT V2, which is pretrained by integrating knowledge from the elite data spark into categorical public datasets. Specifically, a preliminary textual pretraining is adopted to equip the text encoder with primarily ophthalmic textual knowledge. Moreover, a hybrid image-text knowledge injection module is designed for knowledge transfer, which is essentially based on a combination of global semantic concepts from contrastive learning and local appearance details from generative learning. Extensive experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and linear probing settings highlight the generalization and transferability of KeepFIT V2, delivering performance competitive to state-of-the-art fundus VLP models trained on large-scale private image-text datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Lin, Yulong Huang, Hongwei Ren, Zunchang Liu, Yue Zhou, Haotian Fu, Bojun Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion deblurring addresses the challenge of image blur caused by camera or scene movement. Event cameras provide motion information that is encoded in the asynchronous event streams. To efficiently leverage the temporal information of event streams, we employ Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for motion feature extraction and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for color information processing. Due to the non-uniform distribution and inherent redundancy of event data, existing cross-modal feature fusion methods exhibit certain limitations. Inspired by the visual attention mechanism in the human visual system, this study introduces a bioinspired dual-drive hybrid network (BDHNet). Specifically, the Neuron Configurator Module (NCM) is designed to dynamically adjusts neuron configurations based on cross-modal features, thereby focusing the spikes in blurry regions and adapting to varying blurry scenarios dynamically. Additionally, the Region of Blurry Attention Module (RBAM) is introduced to generate a blurry mask in an unsupervised manner, effectively extracting motion clues from the event features and guiding more accurate cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Ishant, Rongliang Wu, Joo Hwee Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable affordance Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has become an increasingly important area of research in computer vision. In HOI generation, the hand grasp generation is a crucial step for effectively controlling the geometry of the hand. Current hand grasp generation methods rely on 3D information for both the hand and the object. In addition, these methods lack controllability concerning the hand's location and orientation. We treat the hand pose as the discrete graph structure and exploit the geometric priors. It is well established that higher order contextual dependency among the points improves the quality of the results in general. We propose a framework of higher order geometric representations (HOR's) inspired by spectral graph theory and vector algebra to improve the quality of generated hand poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOR's in devising a controllable novel diffusion method (based on 2D information) for hand grasp generation that outperforms the state of the art (SOTA). Overcoming the limitations of existing methods: like lacking of controllability and dependency on 3D information. Once we have the generated pose, it is very natural to evaluate them using a metric. Popular metrics like FID and MMD are biased and inefficient for evaluating the generated hand poses. Using our proposed HOR's, we introduce an efficient and stable framework of evaluation metrics for grasp generation methods, addressing inefficiencies and biases in FID and MMD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Publicly available satellite imagery, such as Sentinel- 2, often lacks the spatial resolution required for accurate analysis of remote sensing tasks including urban planning and disaster response. Current super-resolution techniques are typically trained on limited datasets, leading to poor generalization across diverse geographic regions. In this work, we propose a novel super-resolution framework that enhances generalization by incorporating geographic context through location embeddings. Our framework employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and incorporates techniques from diffusion models to enhance image quality. Furthermore, we address tiling artifacts by integrating information from neighboring images, enabling the generation of seamless, high-resolution outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the building segmentation task, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Lu, Bingjie Lu, Feng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical and optical factors interacting with sensor characteristics create complex image degradation patterns. Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to 4D Panoptic LiDAR Segmentation that decouples semantic and instance segmentation, leveraging single-scan semantic predictions as prior information for instance segmentation. Our method D-PLS first performs single-scan semantic segmentation and aggregates the results over time, using them to guide instance segmentation. The modular design of D-PLS allows for seamless integration on top of any semantic segmentation architecture, without requiring architectural changes or retraining. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset, where it demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline in both classification and association tasks, as measured by the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric. Furthermore, we show that our decoupled architecture not only enhances instance prediction but also surpasses the baseline due to advancements in single-scan semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karahan Sar{\i}ta\c{s}, Tingke Shen, Surabhi S Nath, Peter Dayan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how humans perceive visual complexity is a key area of study in visual cognition. Previous approaches to modeling visual complexity have often resulted in intricate, difficult-to-interpret solutions that employ numerous features or sophisticated deep learning architectures. While these complex models achieve high performance on specific datasets, they often sacrifice interpretability, making it challenging to understand the factors driving human perception of complexity. A recent model based on image segmentations showed promise in addressing this challenge; however, it presented limitations in capturing structural and semantic aspects of visual complexity. In this paper, we propose viable and effective features to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we develop multiscale features for the structural aspect of complexity, including the Multiscale Sobel Gradient (MSG), which captures spatial intensity variations across scales, and Multiscale Unique Colors (MUC), which quantifies image colorfulness by indexing quantized RGB values. We also introduce a new dataset SVG based on Visual Genome to explore the semantic aspect of visual complexity, obtaining surprise scores based on the element of surprise in images, which we demonstrate significantly contributes to perceived complexity. Overall, we suggest that the nature of the data is fundamental to understanding and modeling visual complexity, highlighting the importance of both structural and semantic dimensions in providing a comprehensive, interpretable assessment. The code for our analysis, experimental setup, and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailong Guo, Bohan Zeng, Yiren Song, Wentao Zhang, Chuang Zhang, Jiaming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to generate a virtual try-on result by transferring an input garment onto a target person's image. However, the scarcity of paired garment-model data makes it challenging for existing methods to achieve high generalization and quality in VTON. Also, it limits the ability to generate mask-free try-ons. To tackle the data scarcity problem, approaches such as Stable Garment and MMTryon use a synthetic data strategy, effectively increasing the amount of paired data on the model side. However, existing methods are typically limited to performing specific try-on tasks and lack user-friendliness. To enhance the generalization and controllability of VTON generation, we propose Any2AnyTryon, which can generate try-on results based on different textual instructions and model garment images to meet various needs, eliminating the reliance on masks, poses, or other conditions. Specifically, we first construct the virtual try-on dataset LAION-Garment, the largest known open-source garment try-on dataset. Then, we introduce adaptive position embedding, which enables the model to generate satisfactory outfitted model images or garment images based on input images of different sizes and categories, significantly enhancing the generalization and controllability of VTON generation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Any2AnyTryon and compare it with existing methods. The results show that Any2AnyTryon enables flexible, controllable, and high-quality image-based virtual try-on generation.https://logn-2024.github.io/Any2anyTryonProjectPage/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Birsak, John Femiani, Biao Zhang, Peter Wonka</p>
<p>Abstract: Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Paramonov, Mete Ozay, Eunju Yang, Jijoong Moon, Umberto Michieli</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning in the context of limited personal labeled samples (few-shot) is critical for numerous real-world applications, such as smart home devices. A key challenge in these scenarios is balancing the trade-off between adapting to new, personalized classes and maintaining the performance of the model on the original, base classes. Fine-tuning the model on novel classes often leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, where the accuracy of base classes declines unpredictably and significantly. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective mechanism to address this challenge by controlling the trade-off between novel and base class accuracy. We specifically target the ultra-low-shot scenario, where only a single example is available per novel class. Our approach introduces a Novel Class Detection (NCD) rule, which adjusts the degree of forgetting a priori while simultaneously enhancing performance on novel classes. We demonstrate the versatility of our solution by applying it to state-of-the-art Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methods, showing consistent improvements across different settings. To better quantify the trade-off between novel and base class performance, we introduce new metrics: NCR@2FOR and NCR@5FOR. Our approach achieves up to a 30% improvement in novel class accuracy on the CIFAR100 dataset (1-shot, 1 novel class) while maintaining a controlled base class forgetting rate of 2%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we expand the domain of sketch research into the field of image segmentation, aiming to establish freehand sketches as a query modality for subjective image segmentation. Our innovative approach introduces a "sketch-in-the-loop" image segmentation framework, enabling the segmentation of visual concepts partially, completely, or in groupings - a truly "freestyle" approach - without the need for a purpose-made dataset (i.e., mask-free). This framework capitalises on the synergy between sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) models and large-scale pre-trained models (CLIP or DINOv2). The former provides an effective training signal, while fine-tuned versions of the latter execute the subjective segmentation. Additionally, our purpose-made augmentation strategy enhances the versatility of our sketch-guided mask generation, allowing segmentation at multiple granularity levels. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets underscore the superior performance of our method in comparison to existing approaches across various evaluation scenarios.</p>

This ensemble approach is further refined with differential privacy to mitigate overconfidence, ensuring robustness despite the lack of labeled data. Lastly, we use state-of-the-art vision-language models for hazard captioning, generating descriptive labels for the detected hazards. Our method achieved the highest scores in the Challenge on Out-of-Label in Autonomous Driving, demonstrating its effectiveness across all three tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huazhong Zhao, Lei Qi, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: The Visual Language Model, known for its robust cross-modal capabilities, has been extensively applied in various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore the use of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs to align visual and textual features, for acquiring fine-grained and domain-invariant representations in generalizable person re-identification. The adaptation of CLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained features to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant features to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the first challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a three-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions. Initially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person re-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the image encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for each image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to guide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method is introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically, domain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive (pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative (pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to train the image encoder. Collectively, these strategies contribute to the development of an innovative CLIP-based framework for learning fine-grained generalized features in person re-identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mude Hui, Rui-Jie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang, Zirui Wang, Yuyin Zhou, Jason Eshraghian, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow models are effective at progressively generating realistic images, but they generally struggle to capture long-range dependencies during the generation process as they compress all the information from previous time steps into a single corrupted image. To address this limitation, we propose integrating autoregressive modeling -- known for its excellence in modeling complex, high-dimensional joint probability distributions -- into flow models. During training, at each step, we construct causally-ordered sequences by sampling multiple images from the same semantic category and applying different levels of noise, where images with higher noise levels serve as causal predecessors to those with lower noise levels. This design enables the model to learn broader category-level variations while maintaining proper causal relationships in the flow process. During generation, the model autoregressively conditions the previously generated images from earlier denoising steps, forming a contextual and coherent generation trajectory. Additionally, we design a customized hybrid linear attention mechanism tailored to our modeling approach to enhance computational efficiency. Our approach, termed ARFlow, under 400k training steps, achieves 14.08 FID scores on ImageNet at 128 * 128 without classifier-free guidance, reaching 4.34 FID with classifier-free guidance 1.5, significantly outperforming the previous flow-based model SiT's 9.17 FID. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our modeling strategy and chunk-wise attention design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Della Santa, Morgana Lalli</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel Deep Learning-based and lightweight approach for the automated detection of sports highlights (HLs) from audio and video sources. HL detection is a key task in sports video analysis, traditionally requiring significant human effort. Our solution leverages Deep Learning (DL) models trained on relatively small datasets of audio Mel-spectrograms and grayscale video frames, achieving promising accuracy rates of 89% and 83% for audio and video detection, respectively. The use of small datasets, combined with simple architectures, demonstrates the practicality of our method for fast and cost-effective deployment. Furthermore, an ensemble model combining both modalities shows improved robustness against false positives and false negatives. The proposed methodology offers a scalable solution for automated HL detection across various types of sports video content, reducing the need for manual intervention. Future work will focus on enhancing model architectures and extending this approach to broader scene-detection tasks in media analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoosang Lee, Jeha Ryu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16147">Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Lu, Hao Lu, Hua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity. Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongjin Luo, Yang Li, Mingrui Zhang, Senbo Wang, Han Yan, Xibin Song, Taizhang Shang, Wei Mao, Hongdong Li, Xiaoguang Han, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advancements have shown remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation models, the challenge of leveraging these approaches to automatically generate wearable 3D assets remains unexplored. To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16182">The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanyang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm. However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatiana Ta\'is Schein, Gustavo Pereira de Almeira, Stephanie Loi Bri\~ao, Rodrigo Andrade de Bem, Felipe Gomes de Oliveira, Paulo L. J. Drews-Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

<p>Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop an automated and accurate external camera calibration method for multi-camera systems used in 3D surgical scene reconstruction (3D-SSR), eliminating the need for operator intervention or specialized expertise. The method specifically addresses the problem of limited overlapping fields of view caused by significant variations in optical zoom levels and camera locations.
  Methods: We contribute a novel, fast, and fully automatic calibration method based on the projection of multi-scale markers (MSMs) using a ceiling-mounted projector. MSMs consist of 2D patterns projected at varying scales, ensuring accurate extraction of well distributed point correspondences across significantly different viewpoints and zoom levels. Validation is performed using both synthetic and real data captured in a mock-up OR, with comparisons to traditional manual marker-based methods as well as markerless calibration methods.
  Results: The method achieves accuracy comparable to manual, operator-dependent calibration methods while exhibiting higher robustness under conditions of significant differences in zoom levels. Additionally, we show that state-of-the-art Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines are ineffective in 3D-SSR settings, even when additional texture is projected onto the OR floor.
  Conclusion: The use of a ceiling-mounted entry-level projector proves to be an effective alternative to operator-dependent, traditional marker-based methods, paving the way for fully automated 3D-SSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Pang, Jing Yao, Kaiyu Li, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims at categorizing each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications like remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture. Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive.To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations. The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning. In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands. These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores.To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales. In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16227">PDC-ViT : Source Camera Identification using Pixel Difference Convolution and Vision Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Elharrouss, Younes Akbari, Noor Almaadeed, Somaya Al-Maadeed, Fouad Khelifi, Ahmed Bouridane</p>
<p>Abstract: Source camera identification has emerged as a vital solution to unlock incidents involving critical cases like terrorism, violence, and other criminal activities. The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events. Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved. This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT. While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC). These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras. The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network. Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes. The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the advent of foundation models (FM) for digital pathology has relied heavily on scaling the pre-training datasets and the model size, yielding large and powerful models. While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is important for diagnosis of the tumor, and current deep-learning methods rely on a large set of annotated images for training, with high annotation costs. Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Point cloud representation has recently become a research hotspot in the field of computer vision and has been utilized for autonomous vehicles. However, adapting deep learning networks for point cloud data recognition is challenging due to the variability in datasets and sensor technologies. This variability underscores the necessity for adaptive techniques to maintain accuracy under different conditions. In this paper, we present the Multi-View Structural Convolution Network (MSCN) designed for domain-invariant point cloud recognition. MSCN comprises Structural Convolution Layers (SCL) that extract local context geometric features from point clouds and Structural Aggregation Layers (SAL) that extract and aggregate both local and overall context features from point clouds. Additionally, our MSCN enhances feature representation robustness by training with unseen domain point clouds derived from source domain point clouds. This method acquires domain-invariant features and exhibits robust, consistent performance across various point cloud datasets, ensuring compatibility with diverse sensor configurations without the need for parameter adjustments. This highlights MSCN's potential to significantly improve the reliability and domain invariant features in different environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLMLab/MSCN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Kaiwen Zhou, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: The incorporation of high-resolution visual input equips multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enhanced visual perception capabilities for real-world tasks. However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold and 16-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Volumetric rendering has become central to modern novel view synthesis methods, which use differentiable rendering to optimize 3D scene representations directly from observed views. While many recent works build on NeRF or 3D Gaussians, we explore an alternative volumetric scene representation. More specifically, we introduce two new scene representations based on linear primitives-octahedra and tetrahedra-both of which define homogeneous volumes bounded by triangular faces. This formulation aligns naturally with standard mesh-based tools, minimizing overhead for downstream applications. To optimize these primitives, we present a differentiable rasterizer that runs efficiently on GPUs, allowing end-to-end gradient-based optimization while maintaining realtime rendering capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art volumetric methods while requiring fewer primitives to achieve similar reconstruction fidelity. Our findings provide insights into the geometry of volumetric rendering and suggest that adopting explicit polyhedra can expand the design space of scene representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Melo, Filipe Litaiff</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents an iterative adaptive compression model for high-resolution DPX-derived TIFF files used in cinematographic workflows and digital preservation. The model employs SSIM and PSNR metrics to dynamically adjust compression parameters across three configurations (C0, C1, C2), achieving storage reductions up to 83.4 % while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM > 0.95). Validation across three diverse productions - black and white classic, soft-palette drama, and complex action film - demonstrated the method's effectiveness in preserving critical visual elements while significantly reducing storage requirements. Professional evaluators reported 90% acceptance rate for the optimal C1 configuration, with artifacts remaining below perceptual threshold in critical areas. Comparative analysis with JPEG2000 and H.265 showed superior quality preservation at equivalent compression rates, particularly for high bit-depth content. While requiring additional computational overhead, the method's storage benefits and quality control capabilities make it suitable for professional workflows, with potential applications in medical imaging and cloud storage optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Fang, Zeyi Sun, Shangzhan Zhang, Tong Wu, Yinghao Xu, Pan Zhang, Jiaqi Wang, Gordon Wetzstein, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation and editing, with recent advancements enabling albedo-preserving image relighting. However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairong Yu, Tianqing Zhang, Hongwei Wang, Qi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their inherent energy efficiency.Owing to the inherent sparsity in spike generation within SNNs, the in-depth analysis and optimization of intermediate output spikes are often neglected.This oversight significantly restricts the inherent energy efficiency of SNNs and diminishes their advantages in spatiotemporal feature extraction, resulting in a lack of accuracy and unnecessary energy expenditure.In this work, we analyze the inherent spiking characteristics of SNNs from both temporal and spatial perspectives.In terms of spatial analysis, we find that shallow layers tend to focus on learning vertical variations, while deeper layers gradually learn horizontal variations of features.Regarding temporal analysis, we observe that there is not a significant difference in feature learning across different time steps.This suggests that increasing the time steps has limited effect on feature learning.Based on the insights derived from these analyses, we propose a Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention (FSTA) module to enhance feature learning in SNNs.This module aims to improve the feature learning capabilities by suppressing redundant spike features.The experimental results indicate that the introduction of the FSTA module significantly reduces the spike firing rate of SNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets.Our source code is available in https://github.com/yukairong/FSTA-SNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sami Baral, Li Lucy, Ryan Knight, Alice Ng, Luca Soldaini, Neil T. Heffernan, Kyle Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world settings, vision language models (VLMs) should robustly handle naturalistic, noisy visual content as well as domain-specific language and concepts. For example, K-12 educators using digital learning platforms may need to examine and provide feedback across many images of students' math work. To assess the potential of VLMs to support educators in settings like this one, we introduce DrawEduMath, an English-language dataset of 2,030 images of students' handwritten responses to K-12 math problems. Teachers provided detailed annotations, including free-form descriptions of each image and 11,661 question-answer (QA) pairs. These annotations capture a wealth of pedagogical insights, ranging from students' problem-solving strategies to the composition of their drawings, diagrams, and writing. We evaluate VLMs on teachers' QA pairs, as well as 44,362 synthetic QA pairs derived from teachers' descriptions using language models (LMs). We show that even state-of-the-art VLMs leave much room for improvement on DrawEduMath questions. We also find that synthetic QAs, though imperfect, can yield similar model rankings as teacher-written QAs. We release DrawEduMath to support the evaluation of VLMs' abilities to reason mathematically over images gathered with educational contexts in mind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushagra Tiwary, Aaron Young, Zaid Tasneem, Tzofi Klinghoffer, Akshat Dave, Tomaso Poggio, Dan Nilsson, Brian Cheung, Ramesh Raskar</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision systems in nature show remarkable diversity, from simple light-sensitive patches to complex camera eyes with lenses. While natural selection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of years, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing hypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains challenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors. Computational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative trajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental aspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that co-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied agents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like navigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object discrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes. Second, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to resolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory and computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that illuminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted single-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual systems and learn complex behaviors. Through our unified genetic encoding framework, these embodied agents serve as next-generation hypothesis testing machines while providing a foundation for designing manufacturable bio-inspired vision systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingping Tao, Haixia Liu, Jing Su, Xiaochen Yang, Hongchen Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have indeed shown great promise in solving inverse problems in image processing. In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. We divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: the unconditional score function and the guided term. We design the MAP-based guided term estimation method, while the unconditional score function is approximated by an existing score network. To estimate the guided term, we base on the assumption that the space of clean natural images is inherently smooth, and introduce a MAP estimate of the $t$-th latent variable. We then substitute this estimation into the expression of the inverse problem and obtain the approximation of the guided term. We evaluate our method extensively on super-resolution, inpainting, and denoising tasks, and demonstrate comparable performance to DDRM, DMPS, DPS and $\Pi$GDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peilin Yu, Yuwei Wu, Zhi Gao, Xiaomeng Fan, Yunde Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Riemannian meta-optimization provides a promising approach to solving non-linear constrained optimization problems, which trains neural networks as optimizers to perform optimization on Riemannian manifolds. However, existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods take up huge memory footprints in large-scale optimization settings, as the learned optimizer can only adapt gradients of a fixed size and thus cannot be shared across different Riemannian parameters. In this paper, we propose an efficient Riemannian meta-optimization method that significantly reduces the memory burden for large-scale optimization via a subspace adaptation scheme. Our method trains neural networks to individually adapt the row and column subspaces of Riemannian gradients, instead of directly adapting the full gradient matrices in existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods. In this case, our learned optimizer can be shared across Riemannian parameters with different sizes. Our method reduces the model memory consumption by six orders of magnitude when optimizing an orthogonal mainstream deep neural network (e.g., ResNet50). Experiments on multiple Riemannian tasks show that our method can not only reduce the memory consumption but also improve the performance of Riemannian meta-optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yining Wang, Mi Zhang, Junjie Sun, Chenyue Wang, Min Yang, Hui Xue, Jialing Tao, Ranjie Duan, Jiexi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fusing visual understanding into language generation, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are revolutionizing visual-language applications. Yet, these models are often plagued by the hallucination problem, which involves generating inaccurate objects, attributes, and relationships that do not match the visual content. In this work, we delve into the internal attention mechanisms of MLLMs to reveal the underlying causes of hallucination, exposing the inherent vulnerabilities in the instruction-tuning process.
  We propose a novel hallucination attack against MLLMs that exploits attention sink behaviors to trigger hallucinated content with minimal image-text relevance, posing a significant threat to critical downstream applications. Distinguished from previous adversarial methods that rely on fixed patterns, our approach generates dynamic, effective, and highly transferable visual adversarial inputs, without sacrificing the quality of model responses. Comprehensive experiments on 6 prominent MLLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our attack in compromising black-box MLLMs even with extensive mitigating mechanisms, as well as the promising results against cutting-edge commercial APIs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saikat Roy, Mahmoud Mostapha, Radu Miron, Matt Holbrook, Mariappan Nadar</p>
<p>Abstract: Plug-and-play approaches to solving inverse problems such as restoration and super-resolution have recently benefited from Diffusion-based generative priors for natural as well as medical images. However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) was a field campaign aimed at better understanding the impact of wildfires and agricultural fires on air quality and climate. The FIREX-AQ campaign took place in August 2019 and involved two aircraft and multiple coordinated satellite observations. This study applied and evaluated a self-supervised machine learning (ML) method for the active fire and smoke plume identification and tracking in the satellite and sub-orbital remote sensing datasets collected during the campaign. Our unique methodology combines remote sensing observations with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The demonstrated approach successfully differentiates fire pixels and smoke plumes from background imagery, enabling the generation of a per-instrument smoke and fire mask product, as well as smoke and fire masks created from the fusion of selected data from independent instruments. This ML approach has a potential to enhance operational wildfire monitoring systems and improve decision-making in air quality management through fast smoke plume identification12 and tracking and could improve climate impact studies through fusion data from independent instruments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the era of data-driven decision-making, ensuring the privacy and security of shared data is paramount across various domains. Applying existing deep neural networks (DNNs) to encrypted data is critical and often compromises performance, security, and computational overhead. To address these limitations, this research introduces a secure framework consisting of a learnable encryption method based on the block-pixel operation to encrypt the data and subsequently integrate it with the Vision Transformer (ViT). The proposed framework ensures data privacy and security by creating unique scrambling patterns per key, providing robust performance against adversarial attacks without compromising computational efficiency and data integrity. The framework was tested on sensitive medical datasets to validate its efficacy, proving its ability to handle highly confidential information securely. The suggested framework was validated with a 94\% success rate after extensive testing on real-world datasets, such as MRI brain tumors and histological scans of lung and colon cancers. Additionally, the framework was tested under diverse adversarial attempts against secure data sharing with optimum performance and demonstrated its effectiveness in various threat scenarios. These comprehensive analyses underscore its robustness, making it a trustworthy solution for secure data sharing in critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Long, Kangheng Liang, Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa, Richard Mccreadie, Paul Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval (I-TIR) has emerged as a transformative user-interactive tool for applications in domains such as e-commerce and education. Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study forms the basis of a digital twin system of the knee joint, using advanced quantitative MRI (qMRI) and machine learning to advance precision health in osteoarthritis (OA) management and knee replacement (KR) prediction. We combined deep learning-based segmentation of knee joint structures with dimensionality reduction to create an embedded feature space of imaging biomarkers. Through cross-sectional cohort analysis and statistical modeling, we identified specific biomarkers, including variations in cartilage thickness and medial meniscus shape, that are significantly associated with OA incidence and KR outcomes. Integrating these findings into a comprehensive framework represents a considerable step toward personalized knee-joint digital twins, which could enhance therapeutic strategies and inform clinical decision-making in rheumatological care. This versatile and reliable infrastructure has the potential to be extended to broader clinical applications in precision health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Shang, William A. Sethares, Anusha Adluru, Andrew L. Alexander, Vivek Prabhakaran, Veena A. Nair, Nagesh Adluru</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise characterization of stroke lesions from MRI data has immense value in prognosticating clinical and cognitive outcomes following a stroke. Manual stroke lesion segmentation is time-consuming and requires the expertise of neurologists and neuroradiologists. Often, lesions are grossly characterized for their location and overall extent using bounding boxes without specific delineation of their boundaries. While such characterization provides some clinical value, to develop a precise mechanistic understanding of the impact of lesions on post-stroke vascular contributions to cognitive impairments and dementia (VCID), the stroke lesions need to be fully segmented with accurate boundaries. This work introduces the Multi-Stage Cross-Scale Attention (MSCSA) mechanism, applied to the U-Net family, to improve the mapping between brain structural features and lesions of varying sizes. Using the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) v2.0 dataset, MSCSA outperforms all baseline methods in both Dice and F1 scores on a subset focusing on small lesions, while maintaining competitive performance across the entire dataset. Notably, the ensemble strategy incorporating MSCSA achieves the highest scores for Dice and F1 on both the full dataset and the small lesion subset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MSCSA in segmenting small lesions and highlight its robustness across different training schemes for large stroke lesions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Reing, Greg Ver Steeg, Aram Galstyan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the study of neural network interpretability, there is growing evidence to suggest that relevant features are encoded across many neurons in a distributed fashion. Making sense of these distributed representations without knowledge of the network's encoding strategy is a combinatorial task that is not guaranteed to be tractable. This work explores one feasible path to both detecting and tracing the joint influence of neurons in a distributed representation. We term this approach Activation Spectroscopy (ActSpec), owing to its analysis of the pseudo-Boolean Fourier spectrum defined over the activation patterns of a network layer. The sub-network defined between a given layer and an output logit is cast as a special class of pseudo-Boolean function. The contributions of each subset of neurons in the specified layer can be quantified through the function's Fourier coefficients. We propose a combinatorial optimization procedure to search for Fourier coefficients that are simultaneously high-valued, and non-redundant. This procedure can be viewed as an extension of the Goldreich-Levin algorithm which incorporates additional problem-specific constraints. The resulting coefficients specify a collection of subsets, which are used to test the degree to which a representation is distributed. We verify our approach in a number of synthetic settings and compare against existing interpretability benchmarks. We conclude with a number of experimental evaluations on an MNIST classifier, and a transformer-based network for sentiment analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing eye trackers use cameras based on thick compound optical elements, necessitating the cameras to be placed at focusing distance from the eyes. This results in the overall bulk of wearable eye trackers, especially for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets. We overcome this limitation by building a compact flat eye gaze tracker using mask-based lensless cameras. These cameras, in combination with co-designed lightweight deep neural network algorithm, can be placed in extreme close proximity to the eye, within the eyeglasses frame, resulting in ultra-flat and lightweight eye gaze tracker system. We collect a large dataset of near-eye lensless camera measurements along with their calibrated gaze directions for training the gaze tracking network. Through real and simulation experiments, we show that the proposed gaze tracking system performs on par with conventional lens-based trackers while maintaining a significantly flatter and more compact form-factor. Moreover, our gaze regressor boasts real-time (>125 fps) performance for gaze tracking.</p>

Specifically, unlike conventional ranking loss and linear programming approaches that indirectly implement the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) function, our method directly converts SROCC into a loss function by making the sorting operation within SROCC differentiable and functional. Furthermore, to mitigate the discrepancies between batch optimization during network training and global evaluation of SROCC, we introduce a memory bank mechanism. This mechanism stores gradient-free predicted results from previous batches and uses them in the current batch's training to prevent abrupt gradient changes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on both images and point clouds quality assessment tasks, demonstrating performance gains in both cases.</p>

We introduce FedAlign, a lightweight, privacy-preserving framework designed to enhance DG in federated settings by simultaneously increasing feature diversity and promoting domain invariance. First, a cross-client feature extension module broadens local domain representations through domain-invariant feature perturbation and selective cross-client feature transfer, allowing each client to safely access a richer domain space. Second, a dual-stage alignment module refines global feature learning by aligning both feature embeddings and predictions across clients, thereby distilling robust, domain-invariant features. By integrating these modules, our method achieves superior generalization to unseen domains while maintaining data privacy and operating with minimal computational and communication overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fiducial markers are widely used in various robotics tasks, facilitating enhanced navigation, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite their advantages for robots and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, they often disrupt the visual aesthetics of environments because they are visible to humans, making them unsuitable for non-intrusive use cases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahshid shiri, Chandra Bortolotto, Alessandro Bruno, Alessio Consonni, Daniela Maria Grasso, Leonardo Brizzi, Daniele Loiacono, Lorenzo Preda</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model.
  Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images.
  Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings.
  Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romeo Sommerfeld, Christian Helms, Ralf Herbrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) offer the potential for reliable uncertainty quantification and interpretability, which are critical for trustworthy AI in high-stakes domains. However, existing methods often struggle with issues such as overconfidence, hyperparameter sensitivity, and posterior collapse, leaving room for alternative approaches. In this work, we advance message passing (MP) for BNNs and present a novel framework that models the predictive posterior as a factor graph. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first MP method that handles convolutional neural networks and avoids double-counting training data, a limitation of previous MP methods that causes overconfidence. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 with a convolutional neural network of roughly 890k parameters and find that it can compete with the SOTA baselines AdamW and IVON, even having an edge in terms of calibration. On synthetic data, we validate the uncertainty estimates and observe a strong correlation (0.9) between posterior credible intervals and its probability of covering the true data-generating function outside the training range. While our method scales to an MLP with 5.6 million parameters, further improvements are necessary to match the scale and performance of state-of-the-art variational inference methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection helps in reducing the number of deaths. Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) is a newer approach for breast screening, which has many advantages over handheld mammography such as safety, speed, and higher detection rate of breast cancer. Tumor detection, segmentation, and classification are key components in the analysis of medical images, especially challenging in the context of 3D ABUS due to the significant variability in tumor size and shape, unclear tumor boundaries, and a low signal-to-noise ratio. The lack of publicly accessible, well-labeled ABUS datasets further hinders the advancement of systems for breast tumor analysis. Addressing this gap, we have organized the inaugural Tumor Detection, Segmentation, and Classification Challenge on Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound 2023 (TDSC-ABUS2023). This initiative aims to spearhead research in this field and create a definitive benchmark for tasks associated with 3D ABUS image analysis. In this paper, we summarize the top-performing algorithms from the challenge and provide critical analysis for ABUS image examination. We offer the TDSC-ABUS challenge as an open-access platform at https://tdsc-abus2023.grand-challenge.org/ to benchmark and inspire future developments in algorithmic research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichen Zhu, Yuchen Zhu, Molei Tao, Peng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) allows a high-resolution measurement of RNA sequence abundance by systematically connecting cell morphology depicted in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histology images to spatially resolved gene expressions. ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&E stained images. Through better capturing the inherent stochasticity and heterogeneity in ST data, $\textbf{Stem}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial gene expression prediction and generates biologically meaningful gene profiles for new H&E stained images at test time. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on datasets with various tissue sources and sequencing platforms, where it demonstrates clear improvement over existing approaches. $\textbf{Stem}$ generates high-fidelity gene expression predictions that share similar gene variation levels as ground truth data, suggesting that our method preserves the underlying biological heterogeneity. Our proposed pipeline opens up the possibility of analyzing existing, easily accessible H&E stained histology images from a genomics point of view without physically performing gene expression profiling and empowers potential biological discovery from H&E stained histology images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglong Ma, Zilong Li, Yuanlin Li, Jing Han, Junping Zhang, Yi Zhang, Jiannan Liu, Hongming Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Metal artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images can significantly degrade image quality and impede accurate diagnosis. Supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods, trained using simulated datasets, often struggle to perform well on real clinical CT images due to a substantial domain gap. Although state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods use pseudo ground-truths generated by a prior network to mitigate this issue, their reliance on a fixed prior limits both the quality and quantity of these pseudo ground-truths, introducing confirmation bias and reducing clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Radiologist-In-the-loop SElf-training framework for MAR, termed RISE-MAR, which can integrate radiologists' feedback into the semi-supervised learning process, progressively improving the quality and quantity of pseudo ground-truths for enhanced generalization on real clinical CT images. For quality assurance, we introduce a clinical quality assessor model that emulates radiologist evaluations, effectively selecting high-quality pseudo ground-truths for semi-supervised training. For quantity assurance, our self-training framework iteratively generates additional high-quality pseudo ground-truths, expanding the clinical dataset and further improving model generalization. Extensive experimental results on multiple clinical datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of our RISE-MAR over state-of-the-art methods, advancing the development of MAR models for practical application.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Qiu, Can Xu, Yutian Chen, Shibo Zhao, Junyi Geng, Sebastian Scherer</p>
<p>Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) offers a lightweight and cost-effective solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, yet existing learning-based IO models often fail to generalize to UAVs due to the highly dynamic and non-linear-flight patterns that differ from pedestrian motion. In this work, we identify that the conventional practice of transforming raw IMU data to global coordinates undermines the observability of critical kinematic information in UAVs. By preserving the body-frame representation, our method achieves substantial performance improvements, with a 66.7% average increase in accuracy across three datasets. Furthermore, explicitly encoding attitude information into the motion network results in an additional 23.8% improvement over prior results. Combined with a data-driven IMU correction model (AirIMU) and an uncertainty-aware Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), our approach ensures robust state estimation under aggressive UAV maneuvers without relying on external sensors or control inputs. Notably, our method also demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen data not included in the training set, underscoring its potential for real-world UAV applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational modeling of cardiovascular function has become a critical part of diagnosing, treating and understanding cardiovascular disease. Most strategies involve constructing anatomically accurate computer models of cardiovascular structures, which is a multistep, time-consuming process. To improve the model generation process, we herein present SeqSeg (sequential segmentation): a novel deep learning based automatic tracing and segmentation algorithm for constructing image-based vascular models. SeqSeg leverages local U-Net-based inference to sequentially segment vascular structures from medical image volumes. We tested SeqSeg on CT and MR images of aortic and aortofemoral models and compared the predictions to those of benchmark 2D and 3D global nnU-Net models, which have previously shown excellent accuracy for medical image segmentation. We demonstrate that SeqSeg is able to segment more complete vasculature and is able to generalize to vascular structures not annotated in the training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for optimal patient management. In recent years, advancements in deep learning have shown remarkable potential in medical image analysis. Methods In this study, we present "ViTranZheimer," an AD diagnosis approach which leverages video vision transformers to analyze 3D brain MRI data. By treating the 3D MRI volumes as videos, we exploit the temporal dependencies between slices to capture intricate structural relationships. The video vision transformer's self-attention mechanisms enable the model to learn long-range dependencies and identify subtle patterns that may indicate AD progression. Our proposed deep learning framework seeks to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of AD diagnosis, empowering clinicians with a tool for early detection and intervention. We validate the performance of the video vision transformer using the ADNI dataset and conduct comparative analyses with other relevant models. Results The proposed ViTranZheimer model is compared with two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM and ViT-BiLSTM. CNN-BiLSTM is the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (BiLSTM), while ViT-BiLSTM is the combination of a vision transformer (ViT) with BiLSTM. The accuracy levels achieved in the ViTranZheimer, CNN-BiLSTM, and ViT-BiLSTM models are 98.6%, 96.479%, and 97.465%, respectively. ViTranZheimer demonstrated the highest accuracy at 98.6%, outperforming other models in this evaluation metric, indicating its superior performance in this specific evaluation metric. Conclusion This research advances the understanding of applying deep learning techniques in neuroimaging and Alzheimer's disease research, paving the way for earlier and less invasive clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyan Gu, Ellie Onstott, Wenzhong Yan, Tengyou Xu, Ruolin Wang, Zida Wu, Xiang 'Anthony' Chen, Mohammad Haeri</p>
<p>Abstract: Z-stack scanning is an emerging whole slide imaging technology that captures multiple focal planes alongside the z-axis of a glass slide. Because z-stacking can offer enhanced depth information compared to the single-layer whole slide imaging, this technology can be particularly useful in analyzing small-scaled histopathological patterns. However, its actual clinical impact remains debated with mixed results. To clarify this, we investigate the effect of z-stack scanning on artificial intelligence (AI) mitosis detection of meningiomas. With the same set of 22 Hematoxylin and Eosin meningioma glass slides scanned by three different digital pathology scanners, we tested the performance of three AI pipelines on both single-layer and z-stacked whole slide images (WSIs). Results showed that in all scanner-AI combinations, z-stacked WSIs significantly increased AI's sensitivity (+17.14%) on the mitosis detection with only a marginal impact on precision. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that highlights z-stack scanning as a promising technique for AI mitosis detection, paving the way for more reliable AI-assisted pathology workflows, which can ultimately benefit patient management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Tinauer, Maximilian Sackl, Rudolf Stollberger, Stefan Ropele, Christian Langkammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Backgrounds.
  Deep neural networks have demonstrated high accuracy in classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to enlighten the underlying black-box nature and reveal individual contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information and preprocessing on classification performance.
  Methods.
  We utilized T1w MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to distinguish matched AD patients (990 MRIs) from healthy controls (990 MRIs). Preprocessing included skull stripping and binarization at varying thresholds to systematically eliminate texture information. A deep neural network was trained on these configurations, and the model performance was compared using McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and structural similarity metrics between heatmaps were applied to analyze learned features.
  Results.
  Classification performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) were comparable across all configurations, indicating a negligible influence of T1w gray- and white signal texture. Models trained on binarized images demonstrated similar feature performance and relevance distributions, with volumetric features such as atrophy and skull-stripping features emerging as primary contributors.
  Conclusions.
  We revealed a previously undiscovered Clever Hans effect in a widely used AD MRI dataset. Deep neural networks classification predominantly rely on volumetric features, while eliminating gray-white matter T1w texture did not decrease the performance. This study clearly demonstrates an overestimation of the importance of gray-white matter contrasts, at least for widely used structural T1w images, and highlights potential misinterpretation of performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Chu, Yicong Li, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: The analysis of extended video content poses unique challenges in artificial intelligence, particularly when dealing with the complexity of tracking and understanding visual elements across time. Current methodologies that process video frames sequentially struggle to maintain coherent tracking of objects, especially when these objects temporarily vanish and later reappear in the footage. A critical limitation of these approaches is their inability to effectively identify crucial moments in the video, largely due to their limited grasp of temporal relationships. To overcome these obstacles, we present GraphVideoAgent, a cutting-edge system that leverages the power of graph-based object tracking in conjunction with large language model capabilities. At its core, our framework employs a dynamic graph structure that maps and monitors the evolving relationships between visual entities throughout the video sequence. This innovative approach enables more nuanced understanding of how objects interact and transform over time, facilitating improved frame selection through comprehensive contextual awareness. Our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness when tested against industry benchmarks. In evaluations on the EgoSchema dataset, GraphVideoAgent achieved a 2.2 improvement over existing methods while requiring analysis of only 8.2 frames on average. Similarly, testing on the NExT-QA benchmark yielded a 2.0 performance increase with an average frame requirement of 8.1. These results underscore the efficiency of our graph-guided methodology in enhancing both accuracy and computational performance in long-form video understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Chen, Bin Qin, Jiangmeng Li, Hao Chen, Bing Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Ren, Huanyi Xie, Shu Yang, Meng Ding, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As one of the most fundamental models, meta learning aims to effectively address few-shot learning challenges. However, it still faces significant issues related to the training data, such as training inefficiencies due to numerous low-contribution tasks in large datasets and substantial noise from incorrect labels. Thus, training data attribution methods are needed for meta learning. However, the dual-layer structure of mata learning complicates the modeling of training data contributions because of the interdependent influence between meta-parameters and task-specific parameters, making existing data influence evaluation tools inapplicable or inaccurate. To address these challenges, based on the influence function, we propose a general data attribution evaluation framework for meta-learning within the bilevel optimization framework. Our approach introduces task influence functions (task-IF) and instance influence functions (instance-IF) to accurately assess the impact of specific tasks and individual data points in closed forms. This framework comprehensively models data contributions across both the inner and outer training processes, capturing the direct effects of data points on meta-parameters as well as their indirect influence through task-specific parameters. We also provide several strategies to enhance computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in training data evaluation via several downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) is a valuable tool in brain tumor surgery due to its versatility, affordability, and seamless integration into the surgical workflow. However, its adoption remains limited, primarily because of the challenges associated with image interpretation and the steep learning curve required for effective use. This study aimed to enhance the interpretability of ioUS images by developing a real-time brain tumor detection system deployable in the operating room. We collected 2D ioUS images from the Brain Tumor Intraoperative Database (BraTioUS) and the public ReMIND dataset, annotated with expert-refined tumor labels. Using the YOLO11 architecture and its variants, we trained object detection models to identify brain tumors. The dataset included 1,732 images from 192 patients, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation expanded the training set to 11,570 images. In the test dataset, YOLO11s achieved the best balance of precision and computational efficiency, with a mAP@50 of 0.95, mAP@50-95 of 0.65, and a processing speed of 34.16 frames per second. The proposed solution was prospectively validated in a cohort of 15 consecutively operated patients diagnosed with brain tumors. Neurosurgeons confirmed its seamless integration into the surgical workflow, with real-time predictions accurately delineating tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of real-time object detection algorithms to enhance ioUS-guided brain tumor surgery, addressing key challenges in interpretation and providing a foundation for future development of computer vision-based tools for neuro-oncological surgery.</p>

The first method, named DeepSDF predicts the Signed Distance Transform to the object surface for a given point in 3D space. The second method, named MirrorNet reconstructs the occluded objects' parts by generating images from the other side of the observed object. Experiments performed with objects from the ShapeNet dataset, show that the view-dependent MirrorNet is faster and has smaller reconstruction errors in most categories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Elfeki, Rui Liu, Chad Voegele</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.
  We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.
  When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding brain disorders is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyi Zhang, Ying Zheng, Xiaogang Xu, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) remains a largely unsolved problem in the area of computer vision, while self-supervised learning presents a promising solution. Both learning methods attempt to alleviate the dependency of deep networks on the requirement of large-scale labeled data. Although self-supervised methods have recently advanced dramatically, their utility on CDFSL is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the role of self-supervised representation learning in the context of CDFSL via a thorough evaluation of existing methods. It comes as a surprise that even with shallow architectures or small training datasets, self-supervised methods can perform favorably compared to the existing SOTA methods. Nevertheless, no single self-supervised approach dominates all datasets indicating that existing self-supervised methods are not universally applicable. In addition, we find that representations extracted from self-supervised methods exhibit stronger robustness than the supervised method. Intriguingly, whether self-supervised representations perform well on the source domain has little correlation with their applicability on the target domain. As part of our study, we conduct an objective measurement of the performance for six kinds of representative classifiers. The results suggest Prototypical Classifier as the standard evaluation recipe for CDFSL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Reiss, Yedid Hoshen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soufiane Belharbi, Shakeeb Murtaza, Marco Pedersoli, Ismail Ben Ayed, Luke McCaffrey, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging spatiotemporal information in videos is critical for weakly supervised video object localization (WSVOL) tasks. However, state-of-the-art methods only rely on visual and motion cues, while discarding discriminative information, making them susceptible to inaccurate localizations. Recently, discriminative models have been explored for WSVOL tasks using a temporal class activation mapping (CAM) method. Although their results are promising, objects are assumed to have limited movement from frame to frame, leading to degradation in performance for relatively long-term dependencies. This paper proposes a novel CAM method for WSVOL that exploits spatiotemporal information in activation maps during training without constraining an object's position. Its training relies on Co-Localization, hence, the name CoLo-CAM. Given a sequence of frames, localization is jointly learned based on color cues extracted across the corresponding maps, by assuming that an object has similar color in consecutive frames. CAM activations are constrained to respond similarly over pixels with similar colors, achieving co-localization. This improves localization performance because the joint learning creates direct communication among pixels across all image locations and over all frames, allowing for transfer, aggregation, and correction of localizations. Co-localization is integrated into training by minimizing the color term of a conditional random field (CRF) loss over a sequence of frames/CAMs. Extensive experiments on two challenging YouTube-Objects datasets of unconstrained videos show the merits of our method, and its robustness to long-term dependencies, leading to new state-of-the-art performance for WSVOL task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puntawat Ponglertnapakorn, Nontawat Tritrong, Supasorn Suwajanakorn</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to single-view face relighting in the wild, addressing challenges such as global illumination and cast shadows. A common scheme in recent methods involves intrinsically decomposing an input image into 3D shape, albedo, and lighting, then recomposing it with the target lighting. However, estimating these components is error-prone and requires many training examples with ground-truth lighting to generalize well. Our work bypasses the need for accurate intrinsic estimation and can be trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, relit pairs, multi-view images, or lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from off-the-shelf estimators. We propose a novel conditioning technique that simplifies modeling the complex interaction between light and geometry. It uses a rendered shading reference along with a shadow map, inferred using a simple and effective technique, to spatially modulate the DDIM. Moreover, we propose a single-shot relighting framework that requires just one network pass, given pre-processed data, and even outperforms the teacher model across all metrics. Our method realistically relights in-the-wild images with temporally consistent cast shadows under varying lighting conditions. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark Multi-PIE and rank highest in user studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxiang Li, Meixu Chen, Kai Wang, Jun Ma, Alan C. Bovik, You Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image translation has wide applications, such as style transfer and modality conversion, usually aiming to generate images having both high degrees of realism and faithfulness. These problems remain difficult, especially when it is important to preserve content structures. Traditional image-level similarity metrics are of limited use, since the content structures of an image are high-level, and not strongly governed by pixel-wise faithfulness to an original image. To fill this gap, we introduce SAMScore, a generic content structural similarity metric for evaluating the faithfulness of image translation models. SAMScore is based on the recent high-performance Segment Anything Model (SAM), which allows content similarity comparisons with standout accuracy. We applied SAMScore on 19 image translation tasks, and found that it is able to outperform all other competitive metrics on all tasks. We envision that SAMScore will prove to be a valuable tool that will help to drive the vibrant field of image translation, by allowing for more precise evaluations of new and evolving translation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijiang Yang, Zhongwei Qiu, Chang Xu, Dongmei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism is proposed to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, and keeps multi-view consistency and style consistency between multimodal guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jules Sanchez, Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud, Fran\c{c}ois Goulette</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation for autonomous driving has been a growing field of interest in recent years. Datasets and methods have appeared and expanded very quickly, but methods have not been updated to exploit this new data availability and rely on the same classical datasets. Different ways of performing LIDAR semantic segmentation training and inference can be divided into several subfields, which include the following: domain generalization, source-to-source segmentation, and pre-training. In this work, we aim to improve results in all of these subfields with the novel approach of multi-source training. Multi-source training relies on the availability of various datasets at training time. To overcome the common obstacles in multi-source training, we introduce the coarse labels and call the newly created multi-source dataset COLA. We propose three applications of this new dataset that display systematic improvement over single-source strategies: COLA-DG for domain generalization (+10%), COLA-S2S for source-to-source segmentation (+5.3%), and COLA-PT for pre-training (+12%). We demonstrate that multi-source approaches bring systematic improvement over single-source approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Zhu, Guanhui Ye, Chengdong Dong, Xiapu Luo, Shiyao Zhang, Xuetao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Mesh watermark embeds secret messages in 3D meshes and decodes the message from watermarked meshes for ownership verification. Current watermarking methods directly hide secret messages in vertex and face sets of meshes. However, mesh is a discrete representation that uses vertex and face sets to describe a continuous signal, which can be discretized in other discrete representations with different vertex and face sets. This raises the question of whether the watermark can still be verified on the different discrete representations of the watermarked mesh. We conduct this research in an attack-then-defense manner by proposing a novel function space mesh watermark removal attack FuncEvade and then mitigating it through function space mesh watermarking FuncMark. In detail, FuncEvade generates a different discrete representation of a watermarked mesh by extracting it from the signed distance function of the watermarked mesh. We observe that the generated mesh can evade ALL previous watermarking methods. FuncMark mitigates FuncEvade by watermarking signed distance function through message-guided deformation. Such deformation can survive isosurfacing and thus be inherited by the extracted meshes for further watermark decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FuncEvade achieves 100% evasion rate among all previous watermarking methods while achieving only 0.3% evasion rate on FuncMark. Besides, our FuncMark performs similarly on other metrics compared to state-of-the-art mesh watermarking methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aosong Feng, Weikang Qiu, Jinbin Bai, Xiao Zhang, Zhen Dong, Kaicheng Zhou, Rex Ying, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the success of text-to-image diffusion models (DPMs), image editing is an important application to enable human interaction with AI-generated content. Among various editing methods, editing within the prompt space gains more attention due to its capacity and simplicity of controlling semantics. However, since diffusion models are commonly pretrained on descriptive text captions, direct editing of words in text prompts usually leads to completely different generated images, violating the requirements for image editing. On the other hand, existing editing methods usually consider introducing spatial masks to preserve the identity of unedited regions, which are usually ignored by DPMs and therefore lead to inharmonic editing results. Targeting these two challenges, in this work, we propose to disentangle the comprehensive image-prompt interaction into several item-prompt interactions, with each item linked to a special learned prompt. The resulting framework, named D-Edit, is based on pretrained diffusion models with cross-attention layers disentangled and adopts a two-step optimization to build item-prompt associations. Versatile image editing can then be applied to specific items by manipulating the corresponding prompts. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in four types of editing operations including image-based, text-based, mask-based editing, and item removal, covering most types of editing applications, all within a single unified framework. Notably, D-Edit is the first framework that can (1) achieve item editing through mask editing and (2) combine image and text-based editing. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of the editing results for a diverse collection of images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal image fusion and object detection are crucial for autonomous driving. While current methods have advanced the fusion of texture details and semantic information, their complex training processes hinder broader applications. Addressing this challenge, we introduce E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection. E2E-MFD streamlines the process, achieving high performance with a single training phase. It employs synchronous joint optimization across components to avoid suboptimal solutions tied to individual tasks. Furthermore, it implements a comprehensive optimization strategy in the gradient matrix for shared parameters, ensuring convergence to an optimal fusion detection configuration. Our extensive testing on multiple public datasets reveals E2E-MFD's superior capabilities, showcasing not only visually appealing image fusion but also impressive detection outcomes, such as a 3.9% and 2.0% mAP50 increase on horizontal object detection dataset M3FD and oriented object detection dataset DroneVehicle, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarthak Kumar Maharana, Baoming Zhang, Yunhui Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world vision models in dynamic environments face rapid shifts in domain distributions, leading to decreased recognition performance. Using unlabeled test data, continuous test-time adaptation (CTTA) directly adjusts a pre-trained source discriminative model to these changing domains. A highly effective CTTA method involves applying layer-wise adaptive learning rates for selectively adapting pre-trained layers. However, it suffers from the poor estimation of domain shift and the inaccuracies arising from the pseudo-labels. This work aims to overcome these limitations by identifying layers for adaptation via quantifying model prediction uncertainty without relying on pseudo-labels. We utilize the magnitude of gradients as a metric, calculated by backpropagating the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform distribution, to select layers for further adaptation. Subsequently, for the parameters exclusively belonging to these selected layers, with the remaining ones frozen, we evaluate their sensitivity to approximate the domain shift and adjust their learning rates accordingly. We conduct extensive image classification experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating the superior efficacy of our method compared to prior approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai A. Shaaban, Adnan Khan, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records (EHR). This paper introduces MedPromptX, the first clinical decision support system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG narrows the search area in X-ray images, thereby enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We also release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved images and EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR-JPG databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to the baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwen Deng, Yangcen Liu, Wen Li, Guoqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a source portrait, the automatic human body reshaping task aims at editing it to an aesthetic body shape. As the technology has been widely used in media, several methods have been proposed mainly focusing on generating optical flow to warp the body shape. However, those previous works only consider the local transformation of different body parts (arms, torso, and legs), ignoring the global affinity, and limiting the capacity to ensure consistency and quality across the entire body. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Affinity-Graph Network (AAGN), which extracts the global affinity between different body parts to enhance the quality of the generated optical flow. Specifically, our AAGN primarily introduces the following designs: (1) we propose an Adaptive Affinity-Graph (AAG) Block that leverages the characteristic of a fully connected graph. AAG represents different body parts as nodes in an adaptive fully connected graph and captures all the affinities between nodes to obtain a global affinity map. The design could better improve the consistency between body parts. (2) Besides, for high-frequency details are crucial for photo aesthetics, a Body Shape Discriminator (BSD) is designed to extract information from both high-frequency and spatial domain. Particularly, an SRM filter is utilized to extract high-frequency details, which are combined with spatial features as input to the BSD. With this design, BSD guides the Flow Generator (FG) to pay attention to various fine details rather than rigid pixel-level fitting. Extensive experiments conducted on the BR-5K dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the aesthetic appeal of reshaped photos, surpassing all previous work to achieve state-of-the-art in all evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Lin, Mingbao Lin, Luxi Lin, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The circular economy paradigm is gaining interest as a solution to reducing both material supply uncertainties and waste generation. One of the main challenges in realizing this paradigm is monitoring materials, since in general, something that is not measured cannot be effectively managed. In this paper, we propose a real-time synchronized object detection framework that enables, at the same time, autonomous sorting, mapping, and quantification of solid materials. We begin by introducing the general framework for real-time wide-area material monitoring, and then, we illustrate it using a numerical example. Finally, we develop a first prototype whose working principle is underpinned by the proposed framework. The prototype detects 4 materials from 5 different models of inhalers and, through a synchronization mechanism, it combines the detection outputs of 2 vision units running at 12-22 frames per second (Fig. 1). This led us to introduce the notion of synchromaterial and to conceive a robotic waste sorter as a node compartment of a material network. Dataset, code, and demo videos are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhigang Jia, Yuelian Xiang, Meixiang Zhao, Tingting Wu, Michael K. Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult to solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels. Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisu Guan, Huanxin Yang, Xinyu Wang, Shengwei Han, Yongge Liu, Lianwen Jin, Xiang Bai, Yuliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Originating from China's Shang Dynasty approximately 3,000 years ago, the Oracle Bone Script (OBS) is a cornerstone in the annals of linguistic history, predating many established writing systems. Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieyu Zhang, Weikai Huang, Zixian Ma, Oscar Michel, Dong He, Tanmay Gupta, Wei-Chiu Ma, Ali Farhadi, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks for large multimodal language models (MLMs) now serve to simultaneously assess the general capabilities of models instead of evaluating for a specific capability. As a result, when a developer wants to identify which models to use for their application, they are overwhelmed by the number of benchmarks and remain uncertain about which benchmark's results are most reflective of their specific use case. This paper introduces Task-Me-Anything, a benchmark generation engine which produces a benchmark tailored to a user's needs. Task-Me-Anything maintains an extendable taxonomy of visual assets and can programmatically generate a vast number of task instances. Additionally, it algorithmically addresses user queries regarding MLM performance efficiently within a computational budget. It contains 113K images, 10K videos, 2K 3D object assets, over 365 object categories, 655 attributes, and 335 relationships. It can generate 750M image/video question-answering pairs, which focus on evaluating MLM perceptual capabilities. Task-Me-Anything reveals critical insights: open-source MLMs excel in object and attribute recognition but lack spatial and temporal understanding; each model exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses; larger models generally perform better, though exceptions exist; and GPT4o demonstrates challenges in recognizing rotating/moving objects and distinguishing colors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian P. Mahner, Lukas Muttenthaler, Umut G\"u\c{c}l\"u, Martin N. Hebart</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining the similarities and differences between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) is an important goal both in computational cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, promising a deeper understanding of human cognition and safer, more reliable AI systems. Much previous work comparing representations in humans and AI has relied on global, scalar measures to quantify their alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses, these measures only inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine it. To address this challenge, we propose a generic framework to compare human and AI representations, based on identifying latent representational dimensions underlying the same behavior in both domains. Applying this framework to humans and a deep neural network (DNN) model of natural images revealed a low-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In contrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic properties, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. While in-silico experiments showed seemingly consistent interpretability of DNN dimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed substantial differences in how they process images. By making representations directly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for representational alignment and offer a means for improving their comparability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Cao, Huanjing Yue, Xin Liu, Jingyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement models have achieved great success in various tasks of image restoration and enhancement. However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/cao-cong/ZVRD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Posters play a crucial role in marketing and advertising by enhancing visual communication and brand visibility, making significant contributions to industrial design. With the latest advancements in controllable T2I diffusion models, increasing research has focused on rendering text within synthesized images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of automatic poster generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an automatic poster generation framework with text rendering capabilities leveraging LLMs, utilizing a triple-cross attention mechanism based on alignment learning. This framework aims to create precise poster text within a detailed contextual background. Additionally, the framework supports controllable fonts, adjustable image resolution, and the rendering of posters with descriptions and text in both English and Chinese.Furthermore, we introduce a high-resolution font dataset and a poster dataset with resolutions exceeding 1024 pixels. Our approach leverages the SDXL architecture. Extensive experiments validate our method's capability in generating poster images with complex and contextually rich backgrounds.Codes is available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/GlyphDraw2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Monika Wysocza\'nska, Antonin Vobecky, Amaia Cardiel, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Renaud Marlet, Andrei Bursuc, Oriane Sim\'eoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent CLIP-like Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities with a simple contrastive objective, have paved the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image, which contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic $\textit{background}$ text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, textual contrastive concepts that are query-specific. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach to commonly used datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Schmidt, Lazaros Nalpantidis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides a dataset of 14,805 RGB images with segmentation labels for autonomous robotic inspection of reinforced concrete defects. Baselines for the YOLOv8L-seg, DeepLabV3, and U-Net segmentation models are established. Labelling inconsistencies are addressed statistically, and their influence on model performance is analyzed. An error identification tool is employed to examine the error modes of the models. The paper demonstrates that YOLOv8L-seg performs best, achieving a validation mIOU score of up to 0.59. Label inconsistencies were found to have a negligible effect on model performance, while the inclusion of more data improved the performance. False negatives were identified as the primary failure mode. The results highlight the importance of data availability for the performance of deep learning-based models. The lack of publicly available data is identified as a significant contributor to false negatives. To address this, the paper advocates for an increased open-source approach within the construction community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Zhang, Wengyu Zhang, Xulu Zhang, Jiaxin Wu, Xiao-Yong Wei, Jiannong Cao, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate human localization is crucial for various applications, especially in the Metaverse era. Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive, tag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free alternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face limitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error propagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple high-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on the human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the body's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly, increasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to billions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of world coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem, we ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate human localization accuracy of 95% within a 0.3m range and nearly 100% accuracy within a 0.5m range, achieved at a low cost of only 10 USD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaoge Li, Jingcai Guo, Richard Yi Da Xu, Dongsheng Wang, Xiaofeng Cao, Zhijie Rao, Song Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel state-object compositions by leveraging the shared knowledge of their primitive components. Despite considerable progress, effectively calibrating the bias between semantically similar multimodal representations, as well as generalizing pre-trained knowledge to novel compositional contexts, remains an enduring challenge. In this paper, our interest is to revisit the conditional transport (CT) theory and its homology to the visual-semantics interaction in CZSL and further, propose a novel Trisets Consistency Alignment framework (dubbed TsCA) that well-addresses these issues. Concretely, we utilize three distinct yet semantically homologous sets, i.e., patches, primitives, and compositions, to construct pairwise CT costs to minimize their semantic discrepancies. To further ensure the consistency transfer within these sets, we implement a cycle-consistency constraint that refines the learning by guaranteeing the feature consistency of the self-mapping during transport flow, regardless of modality. Moreover, we extend the CT plans to an open-world setting, which enables the model to effectively filter out unfeasible pairs, thereby speeding up the inference as well as increasing the accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01596">Synthesizing Late-Stage Contrast Enhancement in Breast MRI: A Comprehensive Pipeline Leveraging Temporal Contrast Enhancement Dynamics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben D. Fonnegra, Maria Liliana Hern\'andez, Juan C. Caicedo, Gloria M. D\'iaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis due to its ability to characterize tissue through contrast agent kinetics. However, traditional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scan times, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, high costs, and limited accessibility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a pipeline for synthesizing late-phase DCE-MRI images from early-phase data, replicating the time-intensity (TI) curve behavior in enhanced regions while maintaining visual fidelity across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a novel loss function, Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), leveraging the temporal behavior of contrast agents to guide the training of a generative model. Additionally, a new normalization strategy, TI-norm, preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps, addressing limitations of conventional normalization methods. Two metrics are proposed to evaluate image quality: the Contrast Agent Pattern Score ($\mathcal{CP}_{s}$), which validates enhancement patterns in annotated regions, and the Average Difference in Enhancement ($\mathcal{ED}$), measuring differences between real and generated enhancements. Using a public DCE-MRI dataset with 1.5T and 3T scanners, the proposed method demonstrates accurate synthesis of late-phase images that outperform existing models in replicating the TI curve's behavior in regions of interest while preserving overall image quality. This advancement shows a potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols by reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy, and bringing generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios to enhance efficiency in breast cancer imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit Dhiman, Manan Shah, Rishubh Parihar, Yash Bhalgat, Lokesh R Boregowda, R Venkatesh Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of generating highly realistic and plausible mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. We formulate this problem as an image inpainting task, allowing for more user control over the placement of mirrors during the generation process. To enable this, we create SynMirror, a large-scale dataset of diverse synthetic scenes with objects placed in front of mirrors. SynMirror contains around 198k samples rendered from 66k unique 3D objects, along with their associated depth maps, normal maps and instance-wise segmentation masks, to capture relevant geometric properties of the scene. Using this dataset, we propose a novel depth-conditioned inpainting method called MirrorFusion, which generates high-quality, realistic, shape and appearance-aware reflections of real-world objects. MirrorFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SynMirror, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully tackle the challenging problem of generating controlled and faithful mirror reflections of an object in a scene using diffusion-based models. SynMirror and MirrorFusion open up new avenues for image editing and augmented reality applications for practitioners and researchers alike.

<p>Abstract: Large vision and language assistants have enabled new capabilities for interpreting natural images. These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than several specialist models trained to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single image instruction-following model on scene classification, visual question answering, and captioning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Broedermann, Christos Sakaridis, Yuqian Fu, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging multiple sensors is crucial for robust semantic perception in autonomous driving, as each sensor type has complementary strengths and weaknesses. However, existing sensor fusion methods often treat sensors uniformly across all conditions, leading to suboptimal performance. By contrast, we propose a novel, condition-aware multimodal fusion approach for robust semantic perception of driving scenes. Our method, CAFuser, uses an RGB camera input to classify environmental conditions and generate a Condition Token that guides the fusion of multiple sensor modalities. We further newly introduce modality-specific feature adapters to align diverse sensor inputs into a shared latent space, enabling efficient integration with a single and shared pre-trained backbone. By dynamically adapting sensor fusion based on the actual condition, our model significantly improves robustness and accuracy, especially in adverse-condition scenarios. CAFuser ranks first on the public MUSES benchmarks, achieving 59.7 PQ for multimodal panoptic and 78.2 mIoU for semantic segmentation, and also sets the new state of the art on DeLiVER.

<p>Abstract: This study conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation on YOLO11 (or YOLOv11) and YOLOv8, the latest in the "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) series, focusing on their instance segmentation capabilities for immature green apples in orchard environments. YOLO11n-seg achieved the highest mask precision across all categories with a notable score of 0.831, highlighting its effectiveness in fruit detection. YOLO11m-seg and YOLO11l-seg excelled in non-occluded and occluded fruitlet segmentation with scores of 0.851 and 0.829, respectively. Additionally, YOLOv11x-seg led in mask recall for all categories, achieving a score of 0.815, with YOLO11m-seg performing best for non-occluded immature green fruitlets at 0.858 and YOLOv8x-seg leading the occluded category with 0.800. In terms of mean average precision at a 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLOv11m-seg consistently outperformed, registering the highest scores for both box and mask segmentation, at 0.876 and 0.860 for the "All" class and 0.908 and 0.909 for non-occluded immature fruitlets, respectively. YOLO11l-seg and YOLOv8l-seg shared the top box mAP@50 for occluded immature fruitlets at 0.847, while YOLO11m-seg achieved the highest mask mAP@50 of 0.810.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyash Arya, Sukrut Rao, Moritz B\"ohle, Bernt Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: B-cos Networks have been shown to be effective for obtaining highly human interpretable explanations of model decisions by architecturally enforcing stronger alignment between inputs and weight. B-cos variants of convolutional networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), which primarily replace linear layers with B-cos transformations, perform competitively to their respective standard variants while also yielding explanations that are faithful by design. However, it has so far been necessary to train these models from scratch, which is increasingly infeasible in the era of large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, inspired by the architectural similarities in standard DNNs and B-cos networks, we propose 'B-cosification', a novel approach to transform existing pre-trained models to become inherently interpretable. We perform a thorough study of design choices to perform this conversion, both for convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. We find that B-cosification can yield models that are on par with B-cos models trained from scratch in terms of interpretability, while often outperforming them in terms of classification performance at a fraction of the training cost. Subsequently, we apply B-cosification to a pretrained CLIP model, and show that, even with limited data and compute cost, we obtain a B-cosified version that is highly interpretable and competitive on zero shot performance across a variety of datasets. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/shrebox/B-cosification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengpeng Wang, Li Chen, Lili Wang, Zhaofan Li, Xuebin Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression recognition faces challenges where labeled significant features in datasets are mixed with unlabeled redundant ones. In this paper, we introduce Cross Similarity Attention (CSA) to mine richer intrinsic information from image pairs, overcoming a limitation when the Scaled Dot-Product Attention of ViT is directly applied to calculate the similarity between two different images. Based on CSA, we simultaneously minimize intra-class differences and maximize inter-class differences at the fine-grained feature level through interactions among multiple branches. Contrastive residual distillation is utilized to transfer the information learned in the cross module back to the base network. We ingeniously design a four-branch centrally symmetric network, named Quadruplet Cross Similarity (QCS), which alleviates gradient conflicts arising from the cross module and achieves balanced and stable training. It can adaptively extract discriminative features while isolating redundant ones. The cross-attention modules exist during training, and only one base branch is retained during inference, resulting in no increase in inference time. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several FER datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Can Yavuz, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In biomedical imaging analysis, the dichotomy between 2D and 3D data presents a significant challenge. While 3D volumes offer superior real-world applicability, they are less available for each modality and not easy to train in large scale, whereas 2D samples are abundant but less comprehensive. This paper introduces Cross-D Conv operation, a novel approach that bridges the dimensional gap by learning the phase shifting in the Fourier domain. Our method enables seamless weight transfer between 2D and 3D convolution operations, effectively facilitating cross-dimensional learning. The proposed architecture leverages the abundance of 2D training data to enhance 3D model performance, offering a practical solution to the multimodal data scarcity challenge in 3D medical model pretraining. Experimental validation on the RadImagenet (2D) and multimodal volumetric sets demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance in feature quality assessment. The enhanced convolution operation presents new opportunities for developing efficient classification and segmentation models in medical imaging. This work represents an advancement in cross-dimensional and multimodal medical image analysis, offering a robust framework for utilizing 2D priors in 3D model pretraining while maintaining computational efficiency of 2D training.

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved significant success in real-time, high-quality 3D scene rendering. However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sebastian, Pragna R, Sonaa Rajagopal, Muralikrishnan Mani</p>
<p>Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are vital for environmental monitoring due to their high temperature sensitivity, but their complex data poses challenges for predictive models. This study introduces Prion-ViT, a prion-inspired Vision Transformer model, inspired by biological prion memory mechanisms, to improve long-term dependency modeling and temperature prediction accuracy using FSS data. Prion-ViT leverages a persistent memory state to retain and propagate key features across layers, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to 0.71$^\circ$C and outperforming models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and Standard Vision Transformers. This paper also discusses Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, providing a perspective on specklegrams through attention and saliency maps, which highlight key regions contributing to predictions</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubo Lin, Yutong Kou, Zirui Wu, Shaoru Wang, Bing Li, Weiming Hu, Jin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing query-based 3D end-to-end visual trackers integrate detection and tracking via the tracking-by-attention paradigm, these two chicken-and-egg tasks encounter optimization difficulties when sharing the same parameters. Our findings reveal that these difficulties arise due to two inherent constraints on the self-attention mechanism, i.e., over-deduplication for object queries and self-centric attention for track queries. In contrast, removing self-attention mechanism not only minimally impacts regression predictions of the tracker, but also tends to generate more latent candidate boxes. Based on these analyses, we present SynCL, a novel plug-and-play synergistic training strategy designed to co-facilitate multi-task learning for detection and tracking. Specifically, we propose a Task-specific Hybrid Matching module for a weight-shared cross-attention-based decoder that matches the targets of track queries with multiple object queries to exploit promising candidates overlooked by the self-attention mechanism. To dynamically select optimal candidates for the one-to-many matching, we also design a Cost-based Query Filtering module controlled by model training status. Moreover, we introduce Instance-aware Contrastive Learning to break through the barrier of self-centric attention for track queries, effectively bridging the gap between detection and tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynCL consistently delivers improvements when integrated with the training stage of various query-based 3D MOT trackers. Without additional inference costs, SynCL improves the state-of-the-art PF-Track method by $+3.9\%$ AMOTA and $+2.0\%$ NDS on the nuScenes dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donggyu Lee, Juhyeon Park, Taesup Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis has recently made significant advancements, particularly in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD based on MRI images, there remains a critical gap in research regarding the group robustness of the diagnosis. Although numerous studies pointed out that deep learning-based classifiers may exhibit poor performance in certain groups by relying on unimportant attributes, this issue has been largely overlooked in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD conversion. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the group robustness in the early diagnosis of MCI to AD conversion using MRI images, focusing on disparities in accuracy between groups, specifically sMCI and pMCI individuals divided by age. Our experiments reveal that standard classifiers consistently underperform for certain groups across different architectures, highlighting the need for more tailored approaches. To address this, we propose a novel method, dubbed DEAL (DEcoupled classifier with Adaptive Linear modulation), comprising two key components: (1) a linear modulation of features from the penultimate layer, incorporating easily obtainable age and cognitive indicative tabular features, and (2) a decoupled classifier that provides more tailored decision boundaries for each group, further improving performance. Through extensive experiments and evaluations across different architectures, we demonstrate the efficacy of DEAL in improving the group robustness of the MCI to AD conversion prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhou, Mengcheng Lan, Xiang Li, Yiping Ke, Xue Jiang, Litong Feng, Wayne Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) visual grounding aims to use natural language expression to locate specific objects (in the form of the bounding box or segmentation mask) in RS images, enhancing human interaction with intelligent RS interpretation systems. Early research in this area was primarily based on horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), but as more diverse RS datasets have become available, tasks involving oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and segmentation masks have emerged. In practical applications, different targets require different grounding types: HBB can localize an object's position, OBB provides its orientation, and mask depicts its shape. However, existing specialized methods are typically tailored to a single type of RS visual grounding task and are hard to generalize across tasks. In contrast, large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit powerful multi-task learning capabilities but struggle to handle dense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper proposes GeoGround, a novel framework that unifies support for HBB, OBB, and mask RS visual grounding tasks, allowing flexible output selection. Rather than customizing the architecture of VLM, our work aims to elegantly support pixel-level visual grounding output through the Text-Mask technique. We define prompt-assisted and geometry-guided learning to enhance consistency across different signals. To support model training, we present refGeo, a large-scale RS visual instruction-following dataset containing 161k image-text pairs. Experimental results show that GeoGround demonstrates strong performance across four RS visual grounding tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Miao, Georgios Fainekos, Bardh Hoxha, Hideki Okamoto, Danil Prokhorov, Sayan Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in simulation with realistic driving scenarios is important for verifying their performance. However, converting real-world driving videos into simulation scenarios is a significant challenge due to the complexity of interpreting high-dimensional video data and the time-consuming nature of precise manual scenario reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel framework that automates the conversion of real-world car crash videos into detailed simulation scenarios for ADS testing. Our approach leverages prompt-engineered Video Language Models(VLM) to transform dashcam footage into SCENIC scripts, which define the environment and driving behaviors in the CARLA simulator, enabling the generation of realistic simulation scenarios. Importantly, rather than solely aiming for one-to-one scenario reconstruction, our framework focuses on capturing the essential driving behaviors from the original video while offering flexibility in parameters such as weather or road conditions to facilitate search-based testing. Additionally, we introduce a similarity metric that helps iteratively refine the generated scenario through feedback by comparing key features of driving behaviors between the real and simulated videos. Our preliminary results demonstrate substantial time efficiency, finishing the real-to-sim conversion in minutes with full automation and no human intervention, while maintaining high fidelity to the original driving events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongji Yang, Yiru Li, Yingying Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Information retrieval techniques have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in identifying semantic similarities across diverse domains through robust feature representations. However, their potential in guiding synthesis tasks, particularly cross-view image synthesis, remains underexplored. Cross-view image synthesis presents significant challenges in establishing reliable correspondences between drastically different viewpoints. To address this, we propose a novel retrieval-guided framework that reimagines how retrieval techniques can facilitate effective cross-view image synthesis. Unlike existing methods that rely on auxiliary information, such as semantic segmentation maps or preprocessing modules, our retrieval-guided framework captures semantic similarities across different viewpoints, trained through contrastive learning to create a smooth embedding space. Furthermore, a novel fusion mechanism leverages these embeddings to guide image synthesis while learning and encoding both view-invariant and view-specific features. To further advance this area, we introduce VIGOR-GEN, a new urban-focused dataset with complex viewpoint variations in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-guided approach significantly outperforms existing methods on the CVUSA, CVACT and VIGOR-GEN datasets, particularly in retrieval accuracy (R@1) and synthesis quality (FID). Our work bridges information retrieval and synthesis tasks, offering insights into how retrieval techniques can address complex cross-domain synthesis challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Xiang, Liat Sless Gorelik, Yuchen Fan, Omri Armstrong, Forrest Iandola, Yilei Li, Ita Lifshitz, Rakesh Ranjan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Make-A-Texture, a new framework that efficiently synthesizes high-resolution texture maps from textual prompts for given 3D geometries. Our approach progressively generates textures that are consistent across multiple viewpoints with a depth-aware inpainting diffusion model, in an optimized sequence of viewpoints determined by an automatic view selection algorithm.
  A significant feature of our method is its remarkable efficiency, achieving a full texture generation within an end-to-end runtime of just 3.07 seconds on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, significantly outperforming existing methods. Such an acceleration is achieved by optimizations in the diffusion model and a specialized backprojection method. Moreover, our method reduces the artifacts in the backprojection phase, by selectively masking out non-frontal faces, and internal faces of open-surfaced objects.
  Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Texture matches or exceeds the quality of other state-of-the-art methods. Our work significantly improves the applicability and practicality of texture generation models for real-world 3D content creation, including interactive creation and text-guided texture editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of a novel multi-task vision transformer (ViT) model for the estimation of canopy height models (CHMs) using 4-band National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery across the western United States. We compare the effectiveness of this model in terms of accuracy and precision aggregated across ecoregions and class heights versus three other benchmark peer-reviewed models. Key findings suggest that, while other benchmark models can provide high precision in localized areas, the VibrantVS model has substantial advantages across a broad reach of ecoregions in the western United States with higher accuracy, higher precision, the ability to generate updated inference at a cadence of three years or less, and high spatial resolution. The VibrantVS model provides significant value for ecological monitoring and land management decisions, including for wildfire mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiping Ge, Qiang Chen, Zhiwei Jiang, Yafeng Yin, Liu Qin, Ziyao Chen, Qing Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning (WSDVC) aims to localize and describe all events of interest in a video without requiring annotations of event boundaries. This setting poses a great challenge in accurately locating the temporal location of event, as the relevant supervision is unavailable. Existing methods rely on explicit alignment constraints between event locations and captions, which involve complex event proposal procedures during both training and inference. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel implicit location-caption alignment paradigm by complementary masking, which simplifies the complex event proposal and localization process while maintaining effectiveness. Specifically, our model comprises two components: a dual-mode video captioning module and a mask generation module. The dual-mode video captioning module captures global event information and generates descriptive captions, while the mask generation module generates differentiable positive and negative masks for localizing the events. These masks enable the implicit alignment of event locations and captions by ensuring that captions generated from positively and negatively masked videos are complementary, thereby forming a complete video description. In this way, even under weak supervision, the event location and event caption can be aligned implicitly. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods and achieves competitive results compared to fully-supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyeon Lee, Jooyeol Yun, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: Point-based interactive colorization techniques allow users to effortlessly colorize grayscale images using user-provided color hints. However, point-based methods often face challenges when different colors are given to semantically similar areas, leading to color intermingling and unsatisfactory results-an issue we refer to as color collapse. The fundamental cause of color collapse is the inadequacy of points for defining the boundaries for each color. To mitigate color collapse, we introduce a lasso tool that can control the scope of each color hint. Additionally, we design a framework that leverages the user-provided lassos to localize the attention masks. The experimental results show that using a single lasso is as effective as applying 4.18 individual color hints and can achieve the desired outcomes in 30% less time than using points alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has achieved widespread success in compressing large Vision Transformers (ViTs), but a unified theoretical framework for both ViTs and KD is still lacking. In this paper, we propose SpectralKD, a novel unified analytical framework that offers deeper insights into ViTs and optimizes KD via spectral analysis. Our model-wise analysis reveals that CaiT concentrates information in their first and last few layers, informing optimal layer selection for KD. Surprisingly, our layer-wise analysis discovers that Swin Transformer and CaiT exhibit similar spectral encoding patterns despite their architectural differences, leading to feature map alignment guideline. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective spectral alignment method for KD. Benefiting from the deeper understanding by above analysis results, even such a simple strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K without introducing any trainable parameters, improving DeiT-Tiny by $+5.2\%$ and Swin-Tiny by $+1.4\%$ in top-1 accuracy. Furthermore, our post-training analysis reveals that distilled students can reproduce spectral patterns similar to their teachers, opening a new area we term ``distillation dynamics".

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wei, Youyang Yin, Yumeng Li, Jia Wang, Liang Zhao, Jianjian Sun, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Daxin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, "visual o1" began to enter people's vision, with expectations that this slow-thinking design can solve visual reasoning tasks, especially geometric math problems. However, the reality is that current LVLMs (Large Vision Language Models) can hardly even accurately copy a geometric figure, let alone truly understand the complex inherent logic and spatial relationships within geometric shapes. We believe accurate copying (strong perception) is the first step to visual o1. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of "slow perception" (SP), which guides the model to gradually perceive basic point-line combinations, as our humans, reconstruct complex geometric structures progressively. There are two-fold stages in SP: a) perception decomposition. Perception is not instantaneous. In this stage, complex geometric figures are broken down into basic simple units to unify geometry representation. b) perception flow, which acknowledges that accurately tracing a line is not an easy task. This stage aims to avoid "long visual jumps" in regressing line segments by using a proposed "perceptual ruler" to trace each line stroke-by-stroke. Surprisingly, such a human-like perception manner enjoys an inference time scaling law -- the slower, the better. Researchers strive to speed up the model's perception in the past, but we slow it down again, allowing the model to read the image step-by-step and carefully.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving.

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have achieved satisfactory 3D scene representation. Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pu Yang, Bin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Chen, Yi Su, Celine Dumitrascu, Kewei Chen, David Weidman, Richard J Caselli, Nicholas Ashton, Eric M Reiman, Yalin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modality translation between MRI and PET imaging is challenging due to the distinct mechanisms underlying these modalities. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) are revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection by identifying patients and quantifying brain amyloid levels. However, the potential of BBBMs to enhance PET image synthesis remains unexplored. In this paper, we performed a thorough study on the effect of incorporating BBBM into deep generative models. By evaluating three widely used cross-modality translation models, we found that BBBMs integration consistently enhances the generative quality across all models. By visual inspection of the generated results, we observed that PET images generated by CycleGAN exhibit the best visual fidelity. Based on these findings, we propose Plasma-CycleGAN, a novel generative model based on CycleGAN, to synthesize PET images from MRI using BBBMs as conditions. This is the first approach to integrate BBBMs in conditional cross-modality translation between MRI and PET.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichao Wang, Ming Yuan, Chuang Zhang, Qing Xu, Lei He, Jianqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In V2X collaborative perception, the domain gaps between heterogeneous nodes pose a significant challenge for effective information fusion. Pose errors arising from latency and GPS localization noise further exacerbate the issue by leading to feature misalignment. To overcome these challenges, we propose V2X-DGPE, a high-accuracy and robust V2X feature-level collaborative perception framework. V2X-DGPE employs a Knowledge Distillation Framework and a Feature Compensation Module to learn domain-invariant representations from multi-source data, effectively reducing the feature distribution gap between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Historical information is utilized to provide the model with a more comprehensive understanding of the current scene. Furthermore, a Collaborative Fusion Module leverages a heterogeneous self-attention mechanism to extract and integrate heterogeneous representations from vehicles and infrastructure. To address pose errors, V2X-DGPE introduces a deformable attention mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively focus on critical parts of the input features by dynamically offsetting sampling points. Extensive experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Xu, Qingnan Fan, Fei Kou, Shuai Qin, Hong Gu, Ruoyu Zhao, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual prompt, a pair of before-and-after edited images, can convey indescribable imagery transformations and prosper in image editing. However, current visual prompt methods rely on a pretrained text-guided image-to-image generative model that requires a triplet of text, before, and after images for retraining over a text-to-image model. Such crafting triplets and retraining processes limit the scalability and generalization of editing. In this paper, we present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance on the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and scalability. Specifically, by leveraging the probability-flow ordinary equation, we construct a diffusion bridge to transfer the distribution between before-and-after images under the text guidance. By optimizing the text via the bridge, the framework adaptively textualizes the editing transformation conveyed by visual prompts into text embeddings without other models. Meanwhile, we introduce differential attention control during text optimization, which disentangles the text embedding from the invariance of the before-and-after images and makes it solely capture the delicate transformation and generalize to edit various images. Experiments on real images validate competitive results on the generalization, contextual coherence, and high fidelity for delicate editing with just one image pair as the visual prompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduarda Caldeira, Guray Ozgur, Tahar Chettaoui, Marija Ivanovska, Peter Peer, Fadi Boutros, Vitomir Struc, Naser Damer</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the considerable performance improvements of face recognition algorithms in recent years, the same scientific advances responsible for this progress can also be used to create efficient ways to attack them, posing a threat to their secure deployment. Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabelled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https://github.com/gurayozgur/MADation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wulin Xie, Lian Zhao, Jiang Long, Xiaohuan Lu, Bingyan Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view multi-label classification (MvMLC) has recently garnered significant research attention due to its wide range of real-world applications. However, incompleteness in views and labels is a common challenge, often resulting from data collection oversights and uncertainties in manual annotation. Furthermore, the task of learning robust multi-view representations that are both view-consistent and view-specific from diverse views still a challenge problem in MvMLC. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for incomplete multi-view multi-label classification (iMvMLC). Our method factorizes multi-view representations into two independent sets of factors: view-consistent and view-specific, and we correspondingly design a graph disentangling loss to fully reduce redundancy between these representations. Additionally, our framework innovatively decomposes consistent representation learning into three key sub-objectives: (i) how to extract view-shared information across different views, (ii) how to eliminate intra-view redundancy in consistent representations, and (iii) how to preserve task-relevant information. To this end, we design a robust task-relevant consistency learning module that collaboratively learns high-quality consistent representations, leveraging a masked cross-view prediction (MCP) strategy and information theory. Notably, all modules in our framework are developed to function effectively under conditions of incomplete views and labels, making our method adaptable to various multi-view and multi-label datasets. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other leading approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Keser, Halil Ibrahim Orhan, Niki Amini-Naieni, Gesina Schwalbe, Alois Knoll, Matthias Rottmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Absolute robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised, and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of all kinds of shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine the newly available Vision Foundation Models (VFM) as feature extractors with one of four alternative density modeling techniques. In an extensive benchmark of 4 VFMs against 20 baselines, we show the superior performance of VFM feature encodings compared to shift-specific OOD monitors. Additionally, we find that sophisticated architectures outperform larger latent space dimensionality; and our method identifies samples with higher risk of errors on downstream tasks, despite being model-agnostic. This suggests that VFMs are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Ruiz, Tania Ram\'irez, Daniela Moctezuma</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning has become an essential Vision & Language research task. It is about predicting the most accurate caption given a specific image or video. The research community has achieved impressive results by continuously proposing new models and approaches to improve the overall model's performance. Nevertheless, despite increasing proposals, the performance metrics used to measure their advances have remained practically untouched through the years. A probe of that, nowadays metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE are still very used, aside from more sophisticated metrics such as BertScore and ClipScore.
  Hence, it is essential to adjust how are measure the advances, limitations, and scopes of the new image captioning proposals, as well as to adapt new metrics to these new advanced image captioning approaches.
  This work proposes a new evaluation metric for the image captioning problem. To do that, first, it was generated a human-labeled dataset to assess to which degree the captions correlate with the image's content. Taking these human scores as ground truth, we propose a new metric, and compare it with several well-known metrics, from classical to newer ones. Outperformed results were also found, and interesting insights were presented and discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxuan Chen, Kun Yuan, Vinkle Srivastav, Nassir Navab, Nicolas Padoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety. However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations. To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data.
  Methods: Our approach has two key components. First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap. Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data. This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs.
  Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition). Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks.
  Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets. The code and dataset will be released in https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Surg-FTDA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delin An, Pan Du, Pengfei Gu, Jian-Xun Wang, Chaoli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the aorta and its associated arch branches is crucial for diagnosing aortic diseases. While deep learning techniques have significantly improved aorta segmentation, they remain challenging due to the intricate multiscale structure and the complexity of the surrounding tissues. This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing aorta segmentation using a Bayesian neural network-based hierarchical Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) model. Our model consists of a 3D U-Net stream and a hierarchical LoG stream: the former provides an initial aorta segmentation, and the latter enhances blood vessel detection across varying scales by learning suitable LoG kernels, enabling self-adaptive handling of different parts of the aorta vessels with significant scale differences. We employ a Bayesian method to parameterize the LoG stream and provide confidence intervals for the segmentation results, ensuring robustness and reliability of the prediction for vascular medical image analysts. Experimental results show that our model can accurately segment main and supra-aortic vessels, yielding at least a 3% gain in the Dice coefficient over state-of-the-art methods across multiple volumes drawn from two aorta datasets, and can provide reliable confidence intervals for different parts of the aorta.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijie Rao, Jingcai Guo, Miaoge Li, Yang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional dependency present one of the trickiest problems in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, leading to significant property variations of the same state (object) across different objects (states). To address this problem, existing approaches often adopt either all-to-one or one-to-one representation paradigms. However, these extremes create an imbalance in the seesaw between transferability and discriminability, favoring one at the expense of the other. Comparatively, humans are adept at analogizing and reasoning in a hierarchical clustering manner, intuitively grouping categories with similar properties to form cohesive concepts. Motivated by this, we propose Homogeneous Group Representation Learning (HGRL), a new perspective formulates state (object) representation learning as multiple homogeneous sub-group representation learning. HGRL seeks to achieve a balance between semantic transferability and discriminability by adaptively discovering and aggregating categories with shared properties, learning distributed group centers that retain group-specific discriminative features. Our method integrates three core components designed to simultaneously enhance both the visual and prompt representation capabilities of the model. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose. This paper explores the capability of smartphones as computing devices for a quadcopter, specifically in terms of the ability of drones to maintain a position known as the position hold function. Image processing can be performed with the phone's sensors and powerful built-in camera. Method. Using Shi-Tomasi corner detection and the Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow algorithms, ground features are recognized and tracked using the downward-facing camera. The position is maintained by computing quadcopter displacement from the center of the image using Euclidian distance, and the corresponding pitch and roll estimate is calculated using the PID controller. Results. Actual flights show a double standard deviation of 18.66 cm from the center for outdoor tests. With a quadcopter size of 58cm x 58cm used, it implies that 95% of the time, the quadcopter is within a diameter of 96 cm. For indoor tests, a double standard deviation of 10.55 cm means that 95% of the time, the quadcopter is within a diameter of 79 cm. Conclusion. Smartphone sensors and cameras can be used to perform optical flow position hold functions, proving their potential as computing devices for drones. Recommendations. To further improve the positioning system of the phone-based quadcopter system, it is suggested that potential sensor fusion be explored with the phone's GNSS sensor, which gives absolute positioning information for outdoor applications. Research Implications. As different devices and gadgets are integrated into the smartphone, this paper presents an opportunity for phone manufacturers and researchers to explore the potential of smartphones for a drone use-case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dunwei Tu, Huiyu Yi, Yuchi Wang, Baile Xu, Jian Zhao, Furao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning requires machine learning models to continuously acquire new knowledge in dynamic environments while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting through prompt expansion and selection. However, existing approaches often suffer from low accuracy in prompt selection, which can result in the model receiving biased knowledge and making biased predictions. To address this issue, we propose the Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys (MQMK) prompt matching paradigm for precise prompt selection. The goal of MQMK is to select the prompts whose training data distribution most closely matches that of the test sample. Specifically, Multiple Queries enable precise breadth search by introducing task-specific knowledge, while Multiple Keys perform deep search by representing the feature distribution of training samples at a fine-grained level. Experiments show that MQMK enhances the prompt matching rate by over 30% in challenging scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely adopted continual learning benchmarks. Once this paper is accepted, we will release the code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuerui Qiu, Jieyuan Zhang, Wenjie Wei, Honglin Cao, Junsheng Guo, Rui-Jie Zhu, Yimeng Shan, Yang Yang, Malu Zhang, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks are emerging as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks due to their spike-driven paradigm. However, recent research in the SNN domain has mainly focused on enhancing accuracy by designing large-scale Transformer structures, which typically rely on substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantized spike-driven Transformer baseline (QSD-Transformer), which achieves reduced resource demands by utilizing a low bit-width parameter. Regrettably, the QSD-Transformer often suffers from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we first conduct empirical analysis and find that the bimodal distribution of quantized spike-driven self-attention (Q-SDSA) leads to spike information distortion (SID) during quantization, causing significant performance degradation. To mitigate this issue, we take inspiration from mutual information entropy and propose a bi-level optimization strategy to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. Specifically, at the lower level, we introduce an information-enhanced LIF to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. At the upper level, we propose a fine-grained distillation scheme for the QSD-Transformer to align the distribution in Q-SDSA with that in the counterpart ANN. By integrating the bi-level optimization strategy, the QSD-Transformer can attain enhanced energy efficiency without sacrificing its high-performance advantage.For instance, when compared to the prior SNN benchmark on ImageNet, the QSD-Transformer achieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy, accompanied by significant reductions of 6.0$\times$ and 8.1$\times$ in power consumption and model size, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxuan Che, Yifei Wu, Haibo Jin, Yong Xia, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to train a global model from multiple source domains and ensure its generalization ability to unseen target domains. Due to the target domain being with unknown domain shifts, attempting to approximate these gaps by source domains may be the key to improving model generalization capability. Existing works mainly focus on sharing and recombining local domain-specific attributes to increase data diversity and simulate potential domain shifts. However, these methods may be insufficient since only the local attribute recombination can be hard to touch the out-of-distribution of global data. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-efficient framework named Federated Domain Adversarial Generation (FedDAG). It aims to simulate the domain shift and improve the model generalization by adversarially generating novel domains different from local and global source domains. Specifically, it generates novel-style images by maximizing the instance-level feature discrepancy between original and generated images and trains a generalizable task model by minimizing their feature discrepancy. Further, we observed that FedDAG could cause different performance improvements for local models. It may be due to inherent data isolation and heterogeneity among clients, exacerbating the imbalance in their generalization contributions to the global model. Ignoring this imbalance can lead the global model's generalization ability to be sub-optimal, further limiting the novel domain generation procedure. Thus, to mitigate this imbalance, FedDAG hierarchically aggregates local models at the within-client and across-client levels by using the sharpness concept to evaluate client model generalization contributions. Extensive experiments across four medical benchmarks demonstrate FedDAG's ability to enhance generalization in federated medical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Lan, Tianjia Shao, Zixuan Lu, Yu Zhang, Chenfanfu Jiang, Yin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wang, Xuanyu Yi, Haohan Weng, Qingshan Xu, Xiaokang Wei, Xianghui Yang, Chunchao Guo, Long Chen, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Triangle meshes are fundamental to 3D applications, enabling efficient modification and rasterization while maintaining compatibility with standard rendering pipelines. However, current automatic mesh generation methods typically rely on intermediate representations that lack the continuous surface quality inherent to meshes. Converting these representations into meshes produces dense, suboptimal outputs. Although recent autoregressive approaches demonstrate promise in directly modeling mesh vertices and faces, they are constrained by the limitation in face count, scalability, and structural fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose Nautilus, a locality-aware autoencoder for artist-like mesh generation that leverages the local properties of manifold meshes to achieve structural fidelity and efficient representation. Our approach introduces a novel tokenization algorithm that preserves face proximity relationships and compresses sequence length through locally shared vertices and edges, enabling the generation of meshes with an unprecedented scale of up to 5,000 faces. Furthermore, we develop a Dual-stream Point Conditioner that provides multi-scale geometric guidance, ensuring global consistency and local structural fidelity by capturing fine-grained geometric features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Nautilus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and scalability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mete Ahishali, Aysen Degerli, Serkan Kiranyaz, Tahir Hamid, Rashid Mazhar, Moncef Gabbouj</p>
<p>Abstract: Restoration of poor quality images with a blended set of artifacts plays a vital role for a reliable diagnosis. Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romario Gualdr\'on-Hurtado, Roman Jacome, Sergio Urrea, Henry Arguello, Luis Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep-learning (DL)-based image deconvolution (ID) has exhibited remarkable recovery performance, surpassing traditional linear methods. However, unlike traditional ID approaches that rely on analytical properties of the point spread function (PSF) to achieve high recovery performance - such as specific spectrum properties or small conditional numbers in the convolution matrix - DL techniques lack quantifiable metrics for evaluating PSF suitability for DL-assisted recovery. Aiming to enhance deconvolution quality, we propose a metric that employs a non-linear approach to learn the invertibility of an arbitrary PSF using a neural network by mapping it to a unit impulse. A lower discrepancy between the mapped PSF and a unit impulse indicates a higher likelihood of successful inversion by a DL network. Our findings reveal that this metric correlates with high recovery performance in DL and traditional methods, thereby serving as an effective regularizer in deconvolution tasks. This approach reduces the computational complexity over conventional condition number assessments and is a differentiable process. These useful properties allow its application in designing diffractive optical elements through end-to-end (E2E) optimization, achieving invertible PSFs, and outperforming the E2E baseline framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Giulio Franzese, Alessandro Finamore, Massimo Gallo, Pietro Michiardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models for Text-to-Image (T2I) conditional generation have recently achieved tremendous success. Yet, aligning these models with user's intentions still involves a laborious trial-and-error process, and this challenging alignment problem has attracted considerable attention from the research community. In this work, instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models, we use Mutual Information (MI) to guide model alignment. In brief, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on a point-wise (MI) estimation between prompts and images to create a synthetic fine-tuning set for improving model alignment. Our analysis indicates that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art, yet it only requires the pre-trained denoising network of the T2I model itself to estimate MI, and a simple fine-tuning strategy that improves alignment while maintaining image quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric A. F. Reinhardt, P. R. Dinesh, Sergei Gleyzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has established an alternative to traditional multi-layer perceptron neural networks in the form of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). The general KAN framework uses learnable activation functions on the edges of the computational graph followed by summation on nodes. The learnable edge activation functions in the original implementation are basis spline functions (B-Spline). Here, we present a model in which learnable grids of B-Spline activation functions are replaced by grids of re-weighted sine functions (SineKAN). We evaluate numerical performance of our model on a benchmark vision task. We show that our model can perform better than or comparable to B-Spline KAN models and an alternative KAN implementation based on periodic cosine and sine functions representing a Fourier Series. Further, we show that SineKAN has numerical accuracy that could scale comparably to dense neural networks (DNNs). Compared to the two baseline KAN models, SineKAN achieves a substantial speed increase at all hidden layer sizes, batch sizes, and depths. Current advantage of DNNs due to hardware and software optimizations are discussed along with theoretical scaling. Additionally, properties of SineKAN compared to other KAN implementations and current limitations are also discussed</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jielong Tang, Zhenxing Wang, Ziyang Gong, Jianxing Yu, Xiangwei Zhu, Jian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and corresponding visual regions of entities from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension or sequence generation-based frameworks show limitations in this difficult task. The former, utilizing human-designed type queries, struggles to differentiate ambiguous entities, such as Jordan (Person) and off-White x Jordan (Shoes). The latter, following the one-by-one decoding order, suffers from exposure bias issues. We maintain that these works misunderstand the relationships of multimodal entities. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN explicitly aligns textual entities with visual regions by employing a set of learnable queries to strengthen intra-entity connections. Based on distinct intra-entity modeling, MQSPN reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a optimal global matching perspective. Additionally, we incorporate a query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) as a glue network to boost better alignment of two-level relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Saber, Pouria Parhami, Alimohammad Siahkarzadeh, Mansoor Fateh, Amirreza Fateh</p>
<p>Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges."https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia"</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Hou, Buse Giledereli, Yilei Tu, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual language is a system of communication that conveys information through symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Diagrams are a typical example of a visual language depicting complex concepts and their relationships in the form of an image. The symbolic nature of diagrams presents significant challenges for building models capable of understanding them. Recent studies suggest that Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can even tackle complex reasoning tasks involving diagrams. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by developing a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the diagram comprehension capability of LVLMs. Our test suite uses a variety of questions focused on concept entities and their relationships over a set of synthetic as well as real diagrams across domains to evaluate the recognition and reasoning abilities of models. Our evaluation of LVLMs shows that while they can accurately identify and reason about entities, their ability to understand relationships is notably limited. Further testing reveals that the decent performance on diagram understanding largely stems from leveraging their background knowledge as shortcuts to identify and reason about the relational information. Thus, we conclude that LVLMs have a limited capability for genuine diagram understanding, and their impressive performance in diagram reasoning is an illusion emanating from other confounding factors, such as the background knowledge in the models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Li, Yanhui Zhou, Hao Wei, Chenyang Ge, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based extreme image compression methods have achieved impressive performance at extremely low bitrates. However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we directly derive a novel residual diffusion equation from Stable Diffusion's original diffusion equation that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. In this way, we effectively combine the efficiency of residual diffusion with the powerful generative capability of Stable Diffusion. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, thereby further improving the reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RDEIC achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and outperforms existing diffusion-based extreme image compression methods in both fidelity and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoforos Galazis, Huiyi Wu, Igor Goryanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving breast cancer detection and monitoring techniques is a critical objective in healthcare, driving the need for innovative imaging technologies and diagnostic approaches. This study introduces a novel multi-tiered self-contrastive model tailored for microwave radiometry (MWR) in breast cancer detection. Our approach incorporates three distinct models: Local-MWR (L-MWR), Regional-MWR (R-MWR), and Global-MWR (G-MWR), designed to analyze varying sub-regional comparisons within the breasts. These models are integrated through the Joint-MWR (J-MWR) network, which leverages self-contrastive results at each analytical level to improve diagnostic accuracy. Utilizing a dataset of 4,932 female patients, our research demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed models. Notably, the J-MWR model achieves a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.74 $\pm$ 0.018, surpassing existing MWR neural networks and contrastive methods. These findings highlight the potential of self-contrastive learning techniques in improving the diagnostic accuracy and generalizability for MWR-based breast cancer detection. This advancement holds considerable promise for future investigations into enabling point-of-care testing. The source code is available at: https://github.com/cgalaz01/self_contrastive_mwr.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Mirzaei, Mackenzie W. Mathis</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, existing methods still struggle to maintain robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications. Previous studies have attempted to address this challenge by exposing detectors to auxiliary OOD datasets alongside adversarial training. However, the increased data complexity inherent in adversarial training, and the myriad of ways that OOD samples can arise during testing, often prevent these approaches from establishing robust decision boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose AROS, a novel approach leveraging neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) with Lyapunov stability theorem in order to obtain robust embeddings for OOD detection. By incorporating a tailored loss function, we apply Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that both in-distribution (ID) and OOD data converge to stable equilibrium points within the dynamical system. This approach encourages any perturbed input to return to its stable equilibrium, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. To not use additional data, we generate fake OOD embeddings by sampling from low-likelihood regions of the ID data feature space, approximating the boundaries where OOD data are likely to reside. To then further enhance robustness, we propose the use of an orthogonal binary layer following the stable feature space, which maximizes the separation between the equilibrium points of ID and OOD samples. We validate our method through extensive experiments across several benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance, particularly under adversarial attacks. Notably, our approach improves robust detection performance from 37.8% to 80.1% on CIFAR-10 vs. CIFAR-100 and from 29.0% to 67.0% on CIFAR-100 vs. CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhankar Ghosh, Arun Sharma, Jayant Gupta, Aneesh Subramanian, Shashi Shekhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghao Wang, Pengyu Wang, Bo Wang, Dong Zhang, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization.

<p>Abstract: An ecosystem of Transformer-based models has been established by building large models with extensive data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks with minimal cost while achieving effective performance. Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba. We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these methods to better align with the Mamba architecture. Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we will release the code after publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rania Briq, Jiangtao Wang, Stefan Kesselheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Data pruning is the problem of identifying a core subset that is most beneficial to training and discarding the remainder. While pruning strategies are well studied for discriminative models like those used in classification, little research has gone into their application to generative models. Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact. Contrary to intuition, we show that eliminating redundant or noisy data in large datasets is beneficial particularly when done strategically. We experiment with several pruning methods including recent-state-of-art methods, and evaluate over CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that a simple clustering method outperforms other sophisticated and computationally demanding methods. We further exhibit how we can leverage clustering to balance skewed datasets in an unsupervised manner to allow fair sampling for underrepresented populations in the data distribution, which is a crucial problem in generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irham T. Andika, Stefan Schuldt, Sherry H. Suyu, Satadru Bag, Raoul Ca\~nameras, Alejandra Melo, Claudio Grillo, James H. H. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}<3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates was reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</p>

This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps.
  In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but significantly more efficient, operating at about 1.5x the speed. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Fan, Handong Zhao, Ruiyi Zhang, Yu Shen, Xin Eric Wang, Gang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) action grounding is a critical step in GUI automation that maps language instructions to actionable elements on GUI screens. Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and data quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for testing how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in the experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the Q-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page: https://gui-bee.github.io</p>
