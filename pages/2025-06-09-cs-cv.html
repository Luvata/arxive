<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradip Nath</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics, specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies: Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taminul Islam, Toqi Tahamid Sarker, Mohamed G Embaby, Khaled R Ahmed, Amer AbuGhazaleh</p>
<p>Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on livestock applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tinglin Huang, Tianyu Liu, Mehrtash Babadi, Wengong Jin, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yui Tatsumi, Ziyue Zeng, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline across multiple metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Garg, Libing Zeng, Andrii Tsarov, Nima Khademi Kalantari</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore, we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05368">Speaking images. A novel framework for the automated self-description of artworks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentine Bernasconi, Gustavo Marfia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the field of art history regarding such creative diversions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Violence Detection (VD) has become an increasingly vital area of research. Existing automated VD efforts are hindered by the limited availability of diverse, well-annotated databases. Existing databases suffer from coarse video-level annotations, limited scale and diversity, and lack of metadata, restricting the generalization of models. To address these challenges, we introduce DVD, a large-scale (500 videos, 2.7M frames), frame-level annotated VD database with diverse environments, varying lighting conditions, multiple camera sources, complex social interactions, and rich metadata. DVD is designed to capture the complexities of real-world violent events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashik E Rasul, Hyung-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time, accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states. Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy performance and control stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayantani Kar, B. Shresth Bhimrajka, Aditya Kumar, Sahil Gupta, Sourav Ghosh, Subhamita Mukherjee, Shauvik Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an image using various editing software which are readily available. This generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network has been created using a convolutional neural network based on InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence towards the identification of criminal activities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05378">A Compendium of Autonomous Navigation using Object Detection and Tracking in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Arora, Pratyush Shukla, Shivali Chopra</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part of the national security and provide the most valuable service during surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals, there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abu Sufian, Marco Leo, Cosimo Distante, Anirudha Ghosh, Debaditya Barman</p>
<p>Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge. Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet, leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05384">Q-Ponder: A Unified Training Pipeline for Reasoning-based Visual Quality Assessment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoxuan Cai, Jian Zhang, Xinbin Yuan, Pengtao Jiang, Wenxiang Chen, Bowen Tang, Lujian Yao, Qiyuan Wang, Jinwen Chen, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Can Cakmak, Nitin Agarwal, Diwash Poudel</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luka Vetoshkin, Dmitry Yudin</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ, enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K. Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\% boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods fail.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Israa A. Albadarneh, Bassam H. Hammo, Omar S. Al-Kadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images, bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally, this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants, healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianming Huang, Haibo Hu, Yufei Cui, Jiacheng Zuo, Shangyu Wu, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.</p>

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \c{C}a\u{g}lar H{\i}zl{\i}, \c{C}a\u{g}atay Y{\i}ld{\i}z, Pekka Marttinen</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity. We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation (ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zory Zhang, Pinyuan Feng, Bingyang Wang, Tianwei Zhao, Suyang Yu, Qingying Gao, Hokin Deng, Ziqiao Ma, Yijiang Li, Dezhi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65), and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingfei Chen, Zijun Cui, Xiulong Liu, Jinlin Xiang, Caleb Zheng, Jingyuan Li, Eli Shlizerman</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nafiseh Izadyar, Sai Chandra Madduri, Teseo Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360 dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungsoo Kim, Jeongsoo Ha, Yusung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training. We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly improves the generalization performance for unseen observations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongsoo Ha, Kyungsoo Kim, Yusung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method, Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/JeongsooHa/DrG.git</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghwan Shin, Yusung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency (RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas, contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanqi Kong, Weiqin Zu, Xinyu Chen, Yaodong Yang, Song-Chun Zhu, Xue Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR), and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and 8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sajad Mousavi, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Avisek Naug, Antonio Guillen, Ricardo Luna Gutierrez, Soumyendu Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sajad Mousavi, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Avisek Naug, Antonio Guillen, Ricardo Luna Gutierrez, Soumyendu Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging, specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Takishita, Jay Gala, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Kentaro Inui, Yova Kementchedjhieva</p>
<p>Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ludovic Arnould, Salim Khazem, Hugues Ali Mehenni</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However, such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception, reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology, inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant. This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Jiang, Chuan Hu, Yukang Shi, Yuan He, Ke Wang, Xi Zhang, Zhipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However, troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with 0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20% accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally, ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g., weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.</p>

Specifically, we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications, affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A) super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B) reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation (high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code, data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhyung Park, Yihan Hu, Chensheng Peng, Wenzhao Zheng, Kris Kitani, Wei Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations. However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient, query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g., GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing 5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyang Hu, Robert A. Jacobs</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory. Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention. This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human cognition using neural network models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mary Aiyetigbo, Wanqi Yuan, Feng Luo, Nianyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail preservation, and denoising efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Cai, Kangning Yang, Ling Ouyang, Lan Fu, Jiaming Ding, Huiming Sun, Chiu Man Ho, Zibo Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaihang Pan, Wendong Bu, Yuruo Wu, Yang Wu, Kai Shen, Yunfei Li, Hang Zhao, Juncheng Li, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikui Cai, Andrew Wang, Anirudh Satheesh, Ankit Nakhawa, Hyunwoo Jae, Keenan Powell, Minghui Liu, Neel Jay, Sungbin Oh, Xiyao Wang, Yongyuan Liang, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve: its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems -- including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset, generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent, reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomasz Michalski, Adam Wr\'obel, Andrea Bontempelli, Jakub Lu\'styk, Mikolaj Kniejski, Stefano Teso, Andrea Passerini, Bartosz Zieli\'nski, Dawid Rymarczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sethuraman TV, Savya Khosla, Vignesh Srinivasakumar, Jiahui Huang, Seoung Wug Oh, Simon Jenni, Derek Hoiem, Joon-Young Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent, spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vadim Tschernezki, Diane Larlus, Andrea Vedaldi, Iro Laina</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long, dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the (incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and realistic setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Shu, Hangui Lin, Yexin Liu, Yan Zhang, Gangyan Zeng, Yan Li, Yu Zhou, Ser-Nam Lim, Harry Yang, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for scene text spotting and understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries, leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality, physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Meuleman, Ishaan Shah, Alexandre Lanvin, Bernhard Kerbl, George Drettakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyue Zhu, Shenlong Wang, Jin Xie, Jiang-jiang Liu, Jingdong Wang, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Lin, Chenguo Lin, Panwang Pan, Honglei Yan, Yiqiang Feng, Yadong Mu, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct 3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified, compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts, ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation. To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images, demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mo Zhou, Keren Ye, Mauricio Delbracio, Peyman Milanfar, Vishal M. Patel, Hossein Talebi</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines. Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations, i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex degradations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchen Lin, Mingtao Feng, Weisheng Dong, Fangfang Wu, Jianqiao Luo, Yaonan Wang, Guangming Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing. Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent superiority across all degradation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanmukha Vellamcheti, Sanjoy Kundu, Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yimei Liu, Yakun Ju, Yuan Rao, Hao Fan, Junyu Dong, Feng Gao, Qian Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone, subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI, with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR: 0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases, outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review (N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations. TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.</p>

DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugues Thomas, Chen Chen, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on 2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is vital for robust progress in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana Carolina Condez, Diogo Tavares, Jo\~ao Magalh\~aes</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05709">Token Transforming: A Unified and Training-Free Token Compression Framework for Vision Transformer Acceleration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanhu Zeng, Deli Yu, Zhenglun Kong, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper, we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingshun Huang, Haitao Lin, Tianyu Wang, Yanwei Fu, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xiangyang Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level. However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances. Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size. Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bimal Kumar Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures - weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiga Shinozaki, Tomoki Doi, Satoshi Nishida, Hitomi Yanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ynklab/FILM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Fan, Yifan Zuo, Patrick Blaes, Harley Montgomery, Subhasis Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ) Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/stevenlin510/GazeNLQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojie Yu, Zhaonian Wang, Yihan Pan, Meng Cheng, Hao Yang, Chao Wang, Tao Xie, Xiaoming Xu, Xiaoming Wei, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX 4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45 FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140 ms and 215 ms, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity, noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in https://github.com/barry664/DeformCL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quansong He, Xiangde Min, Kaishen Wang, Tao He</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor. We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community. Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second (MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myungkyu Koo, Subin Kim, Sangkyung Kwak, Jaehyun Nam, Seojin Kim, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively. Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending, and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile framework for font customization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view), the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective (e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives, thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at https://github.com/lovelyqian/ObjectRelator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinjuan Wang, Wenzhang Sun, Ming Li, Yun Zheng, Fanyao Li, Zhulin Tao, Donglin Di, Hao Li, Wei Chen, Xianglin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field, existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics. Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments, and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT) device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32 images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional, uniform light.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiakai Zhang, Shouchen Zhou, Haizhao Dai, Xinhang Liu, Peihao Wang, Zhiwen Fan, Yuan Pei, Jingyi Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Li, Xingyu Qiu, Yuqian Fu, Jie Chen, Tianwen Qian, Xu Zheng, Danda Pani Paudel, Yanwei Fu, Xuanjing Huang, Luc Van Gool, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daming Wang, Yuhao Song, Zijian He, Kangliang Chen, Xing Pan, Lu Deng, Weihao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck" without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2) multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and (3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Li, Yang Yang, Zichang Tan, Huan Liu, Weihua Chen, Xu Zhou, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However, most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders, i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder (SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results of grounding manipulated content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Dongdong Meng, Sheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%, which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper, we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is available at link https://github.com/earis/Offsetadjustment\_Background-location\_Decoder\_Mask2former.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Landgraf, Markus Hillemann, Markus Ulrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Zhu, Haolin Wang, Shilin Ma, Wenliang Zhao, Yansong Tang, Lei Chen, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjie Fu, Tengjiao Sun, Pengcheng Fang, Xiaohao Cai, Hansung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingrui Li, Yiming Zhou, Hongxing Zhou, Xinggang Hu, Florian Roemer, Hongyu Wang, Ahmad Osman</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static 3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Hu, Siyuan Chen, Dawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research. This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA methods in agricultural image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonglin Wu, Yule Xue, Xin Wei, Yiren Song</p>
<p>Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Qiu, Yftah Ziser, Anna Korhonen, Shay B. Cohen, Edoardo M. Ponti</p>
<p>Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Sun, Jiacheng Zhang, Zesheng Ye, Chaowei Xiao, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI). Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then, based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels to different samples in DBP methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyi Zhang, Dong Liang, Hairong Zheng, Yihang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.</p>

Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums). The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of 97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taoran Yue, Xiaojin Lu, Jiaxi Cai, Yuanping Chen, Shibing Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed. Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection performance and broad application prospects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julio Silva-Rodr\'iguez, Leo Fillioux, Paul-Henry Courn\`ede, Maria Vakalopoulou, Stergios Christodoulidis, Ismail Ben Ayed, Jose Dolz</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP, and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Yuan, Selena Song, Javier Fernandez, Yadan Luo, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Zijian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield. Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology; (2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements. Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koulischer Felix, Handke Florian, Deleu Johannes, Demeester Thomas, Ambrogioni Luca</p>
<p>Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikang Wang, Boyu Chen, Zhengrong Yue, Yi Wang, Yu Qiao, Limin Wang, Yali Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanwen Liu, Huanna Song, Yang Wang, Nan Yang, Shangyu Xie, Yisheng An, Xiangmo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE). Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information, and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Lengyel</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion, spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144">CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> David Wan, Han Wang, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision, speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Li, Shunlin Liang, Yuxiang Zhang, Liqin Liu, Keyan Chen, Yongzhe Chen, Han Ma, Jianglei Xu, Yichuan Ma, Shikang Guan, Zhenwei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

While previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors (e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback.

<p>Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diji Yang, Minghao Liu, Chung-Hsiang Lo, Yi Zhang, James Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind, that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization versus 0-30% with standard configurations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Babaiee, Peyman M. Kiasari, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists, `conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems' capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g., Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form. Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like conceptualization in AI visual models.

<p>Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Schmidt, Simon Giebenhain, Matthias Niessner</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable, high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a significant margin.</p>

T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge, partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral, ``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length, open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs -- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs. These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatao Gu, Tianrong Chen, David Berthelot, Huangjie Zheng, Yuyang Wang, Ruixiang Zhang, Laurent Dinh, Miguel Angel Bautista, Josh Susskind, Shuangfei Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity, complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization. STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yi, Yulu Pan, Feihong He, Xinyu Liu, Benjamin Zhang, Oluwatumininu Oguntola, Gedas Bertasius</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains 3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only 44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various physical and procedural domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Liu, Weijie Su, Xizhou Zhu, Wenhai Wang, Jifeng Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Sohail Danish, Muhammad Akhtar Munir, Syed Roshaan Ali Shah, Muhammad Haris Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Jorma Laaksonen, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench and Copernicus-Bench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ambrose Emmett-Iwaniw, Nathan Kirk</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels (referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover, we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more realistic reconstructed images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Xun, Siyuan Liang, Xiaojun Jia, Xinwei Liu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2) Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in training cost of less than 15%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajid Hussain, Muhammad Sohail, Nauman Ali Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31% accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01) under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively, compared to a baseline U-Net model.

<p>Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.</p>

While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Wang, Patrick Rim, Tian Tian, Alex Wong, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode different types of information and may thus draw information differently from the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data. This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model, capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how outputs borrow from training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajjad Abdoli, Freeman Lewin, Gediminas Vasiliauskas, Fabian Schonholz</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs, achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6% and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 6.3${\times}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dumindu Tissera, Omar Awadallah, Muhammad Umair Danish, Ayan Sadhu, Katarina Grolinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data, which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances. The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or computational complexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Ji, Yuqi Feng, Jiahao Fan, Yanan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search (NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS, the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS. Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for predictor-based methods in the NAS community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongshang Yan, Jiaxuan He, Delun Li, Yi Yang, Wenjie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of 28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset, a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page: https://pro-assist.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayar Elfares, Pascal Reisert, Ralf K\"usters, Andreas Bulling</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate, therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic representation of eye images that contains the information required for verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchao Zheng, Jianing Zhang, Guochen Ning, Hongen Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haripriya Harikumar, Santu Rana</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates. This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minglang Chen, Jie He, Caixu Xu, Bocheng Liang, Shengli Li, Guannan He, Xiongjie Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation. However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task, and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales, thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively, and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of FPDANet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadine Garibli, Mayank Patwari, Bence Csiba, Yi Wei, Kostas Sidiropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours. A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour; these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanessa Borst, Anna Riedmann, Tassilo Dege, Konstantin M\"uller, Astrid Schmieder, Birgit Lugrin, Samuel Kounev</p>
<p>Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations, presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations, elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital health tools across clinical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Borsani, Andrea Rosani, Giuseppe Nicosia, Giuseppe Di Fatta</p>
<p>Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery (SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the optimisation of the learning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyan Zhi, Peihao Chen, Siyuan Zhou, Yubo Dong, Quanxi Wu, Lei Han, Mingkui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability. Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without hardware-specific training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery, exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning, are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Wu, Julius Pfrommer, Mingyuan Zhou, J\"urgen Beyerer</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a combined generative and contrastive neural architecture for learning latent representations of 3D volumetric shapes. The architecture uses two encoder branches for voxel grids and multi-view images from the same underlying shape. The main idea is to combine a contrastive loss between the resulting latent representations with an additional reconstruction loss. That helps to avoid collapsing the latent representations as a trivial solution for minimizing the contrastive loss. A novel dynamic switching approach is used to cross-train two encoders with a shared decoder. The switching approach also enables the stop gradient operation on a random branch. Further classification experiments show that the latent representations learned with our self-supervised method integrate more useful information from the additional input data implicitly, thus leading to better reconstruction and classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshana Saravanan, Naresh Manwani, Vineet Gandhi</p>
<p>Abstract: We motivate weakly supervised learning as an effective learning paradigm for problems where curating perfectly annotated datasets is expensive and may require domain expertise such as fine-grained classification. We focus on Partial Label Learning (PLL), a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centres on NPLL and presents a framework that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing. The classifier's features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare against nine NPLL and PLL methods. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all studied settings from the prior literature, obtaining substantial gains in the simulated fine-grained benchmarks. Further, we show the promising generalisation capability of our framework in realistic, fine-grained, crowd-sourced datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LlavaGuard, a suite of VLM-based vision safeguards that address the critical need for reliable guardrails in the era of large-scale data and models. To this end, we establish a novel open framework, describing a customizable safety taxonomy, data preprocessing, augmentation, and training setup. For teaching a VLM safeguard on safety, we further create a multimodal safety dataset with high-quality human expert annotations, where each image is labeled with a safety rating, category, and rationale. We also employ advanced augmentations to support context-specific assessments. The resulting LlavaGuard models, ranging from 0.5B to 7B, serve as a versatile tool for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content against flexible policies. In comprehensive experiments, LlavaGuard outperforms both state-of-the-art safeguards and VLMs in accuracy and in flexibly handling different policies. Additionally, we demonstrate LlavaGuard's performance in two real-world applications: large-scale dataset annotation and moderation of text-to-image models.

<p>Abstract: Regular screening and early discovery of uterine fibroid are crucial for preventing potential malignant transformations and ensuring timely, life-saving interventions. To this end, we collect and annotate the first ultrasound video dataset with 100 videos for uterine fibroid segmentation (UFUV). We also present Local-Global Reciprocal Network (LGRNet) to efficiently and effectively propagate the long-term temporal context which is crucial to help distinguish between uninformative noisy surrounding tissues and target lesion regions. Specifically, the Cyclic Neighborhood Propagation (CNP) is introduced to propagate the inter-frame local temporal context in a cyclic manner. Moreover, to aggregate global temporal context, we first condense each frame into a set of frame bottleneck queries and devise Hilbert Selective Scan (HilbertSS) to both efficiently path connect each frame and preserve the locality bias. A distribute layer is then utilized to disseminate back the global context for reciprocal refinement. Extensive experiments on UFUV and three public Video Polyp Segmentation (VPS) datasets demonstrate consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, indicating the effectiveness and versatility of LGRNet.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Remi Chierchia, Leo Lebrat, David Ahmedt-Aristizabal, Olivier Salvado, Clinton Fookes, Rodrigo Santa Cruz</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing chronic wounds is a global challenge that can be alleviated by the adoption of automatic systems for clinical wound assessment from consumer-grade videos. While 2D image analysis approaches are insufficient for handling the 3D features of wounds, existing approaches utilizing 3D reconstruction methods have not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on 3D wound reconstruction from consumer-grade videos. Specifically, we introduce the SALVE dataset, comprising video recordings of realistic wound phantoms captured with different cameras. Using this dataset, we assess the accuracy and precision of state-of-the-art methods for 3D reconstruction, ranging from traditional photogrammetry pipelines to advanced neural rendering approaches. In our experiments, we observe that photogrammetry approaches do not provide smooth surfaces suitable for precise clinical measurements of wounds. Neural rendering approaches show promise in addressing this issue, advancing the use of this technology in wound care practices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Taparia, Som Sagar, Ransalu Senanayake</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the inner representation of a neural network helps users improve models. Concept-based methods have become a popular choice for explaining deep neural networks post-hoc because, unlike most other explainable AI techniques, they can be used to test high-level visual "concepts" that are not directly related to feature attributes. For instance, the concept of "stripes" is important to classify an image as a zebra. Concept-based explanation methods, however, require practitioners to guess and manually collect multiple candidate concept image sets, making the process labor-intensive and prone to overlooking important concepts. Addressing this limitation, in this paper, we frame concept image set creation as an image generation problem. However, since naively using a standard generative model does not result in meaningful concepts, we devise a reinforcement learning-based preference optimization (RLPO) algorithm that fine-tunes a vision-language generative model from approximate textual descriptions of concepts. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate our method's ability to efficiently and reliably articulate diverse concepts that are otherwise challenging to craft manually.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongtao Huang, Xiaojun Chang, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are cutting-edge generative models adept at producing diverse, high-quality images. Despite their effectiveness, these models often require significant computational resources owing to their numerous sequential denoising steps and the significant inference cost of each step. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have been employed to automatically search for faster generation processes. However, NAS for diffusion is inherently time-consuming as it requires estimating thousands of diffusion models to search for the optimal one. In this paper, we introduce Flexiffusion, a novel training-free NAS paradigm designed to accelerate diffusion models by concurrently optimizing generation steps and network structures. Specifically, we partition the generation process into isometric step segments, each sequentially composed of a full step, multiple partial steps, and several null steps. The full step computes all network blocks, while the partial step involves part of the blocks, and the null step entails no computation. Flexiffusion autonomously explores flexible step combinations for each segment, substantially reducing search costs and enabling greater acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for diffusion models. Our searched models reported speedup factors of $2.6\times$ and $1.5\times$ for the original LDM-4-G and the SOTA, respectively. The factors for Stable Diffusion V1.5 and the SOTA are $5.1\times$ and $2.0\times$. We also verified the performance of Flexiffusion on multiple datasets, and positive experiment results indicate that Flexiffusion can effectively reduce redundancy in diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhao Jia, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Tianqing Fang, Zhihan Zhang, Siru Ouyang, Hongming Zhang, Dong Yu, Meng Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasanna Mayilvahanan, Roland S. Zimmermann, Thadd\"aus Wiedemer, Evgenia Rusak, Attila Juhos, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Domain (OOD) generalization is the ability of a model trained on one or more domains to generalize to unseen domains. In the ImageNet era of computer vision, evaluation sets for measuring a model's OOD performance were designed to be strictly OOD with respect to style. However, the emergence of foundation models and expansive web-scale datasets has obfuscated this evaluation process, as datasets cover a broad range of domains and risk test domain contamination. In search of the forgotten domain generalization, we create large-scale datasets subsampled from LAION -- LAION-Natural and LAION-Rendition -- that are strictly OOD to corresponding ImageNet and DomainNet test sets in terms of style. Training CLIP models on these datasets reveals that a significant portion of their performance is explained by in-domain examples. This indicates that the OOD generalization challenges from the ImageNet era still prevail and that training on web-scale data merely creates the illusion of OOD generalization. Furthermore, through a systematic exploration of combining natural and rendition datasets in varying proportions, we identify optimal mixing ratios for model generalization across these domains. Our datasets and results re-enable meaningful assessment of OOD robustness at scale -- a crucial prerequisite for improving model robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songtao Jiang, Yan Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Tianxiang Hu, Yeying Jin, Qinglin He, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G\'abor Hidy, Bence Bakos, Andr\'as Luk\'acs</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, the scarcity of labeled training data poses a significant challenge when training deep neural networks. When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yang, Lisen Dai, Xiangqi Wang, Minhao Cheng, Yapeng Tian, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhong Lin, Cheng-En Wu, Huanran Li, Jifan Zhang, Yu Hen Hu, Pedro Morgado</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning paradigm for visual representation learning, enabling models to acquire rich visual representations by predicting masked portions of images from their visible regions. While this approach has shown promising results, we hypothesize that its effectiveness may be limited by optimization challenges during early training stages, where models are expected to learn complex image distributions from partial observations before developing basic visual processing capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a prototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning process to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in the dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that gradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient learning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we demonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both training efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially fewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding. Our findings suggest that carefully controlling the order of training examples plays a crucial role in self-supervised visual learning, providing a practical solution to the early-stage optimization challenges in MIM.</p>

Grimm, John M. Lewin, James S. Duncan, Julia A. Schnabel, Oliver Diaz, Karim Lekadir, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different distributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative models. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance/FID) from natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features. To this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images, FRD (Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to other image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications, including out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image translation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image generation. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with radiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the literature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation of image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first large-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image translation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future research. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety of datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential of FRD for medical image analysis.</p>

Unlike conventional 3D modeling and animation techniques that require extensive manual effort and expertise, we introduce a method that generates such assets with signals distilled from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. To ensure the temporal consistency of object intrinsics, we propose Neural Templates for temporal-state-guided distillation, derived automatically from image features from self-supervised learning. Our method can generate high-quality temporal object intrinsics for several natural phenomena and enable the sampling and controllable rendering of these dynamic objects from any viewpoint, under any environmental lighting conditions, at any time of their lifespan.

<p>Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are likelihood-based models for continuous inputs. They have demonstrated promising results on both density estimation and generative modeling tasks, but have received relatively little attention in recent years. In this work, we demonstrate that NFs are more powerful than previously believed. We present TarFlow: a simple and scalable architecture that enables highly performant NF models. TarFlow can be thought of as a Transformer-based variant of Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): it consists of a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches, alternating the autoregression direction between layers. TarFlow is straightforward to train end-to-end, and capable of directly modeling and generating pixels. We also propose three key techniques to improve sample quality: Gaussian noise augmentation during training, a post training denoising procedure, and an effective guidance method for both class-conditional and unconditional settings. Putting these together, TarFlow sets new state-of-the-art results on likelihood estimation for images, beating the previous best methods by a large margin, and generates samples with quality and diversity comparable to diffusion models, for the first time with a stand-alone NF model.

<p>Abstract: Automatically generating multiview illusions is a compelling challenge, where a single piece of visual content offers distinct interpretations from different viewing perspectives. Traditional methods, such as shadow art and wire art, create interesting 3D illusions but are limited to simple visual outputs (i.e., figure-ground or line drawing), restricting their artistic expressiveness and practical versatility. Recent diffusion-based illusion generation methods can generate more intricate designs but are confined to 2D images. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach for creating 3D multiview illusions based on user-provided text prompts or images. Our method leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to optimize the textures and geometry of neural 3D representations through differentiable rendering. When viewed from multiple angles, this produces different interpretations. We develop several techniques to improve the quality of the generated 3D multiview illusions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and showcase illusion generation with diverse 3D forms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Wei Li, Didi Zhu, Hangjie Yuan, Wendi Zheng, Dan Zhang, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation provides a generalized configuration for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Optimizers such as SGD and Adam are commonly used for weight updates in continual learning and continual pre-training. However, access to gradient information is not always feasible in practice due to black-box APIs, hardware constraints, or non-differentiable systems, a challenge we refer to as the gradient bans. To bridge this gap, we introduce ZeroFlow, the first benchmark designed to evaluate gradient-free optimization algorithms for overcoming forgetting. ZeroFlow examines a suite of forward pass-based methods across various algorithms, forgetting scenarios, and datasets. Our results show that forward passes alone can be sufficient to mitigate forgetting. We uncover novel optimization principles that highlight the potential of forward pass-based methods in mitigating forgetting, managing task conflicts, and reducing memory demands. Additionally, we propose new enhancements that further improve forgetting resistance using only forward passes. This work provides essential tools and insights to advance the development of forward-pass-based methods for continual learning.</p>

Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhen Zhu, Mokai Pan, Yuexin Ma, Yanwei Fu, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhoon Kim, Yanjun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating high-quality, diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, their ability to reproduce copyrighted styles, sensitive imagery, and harmful content raises significant ethical and legal concerns. Concept erasure offers a proactive alternative to external filtering by modifying T2I models to prevent the generation of undesired content. In this survey, we provide a structured overview of concept erasure, categorizing existing methods based on their optimization strategies and the architectural components they modify. We categorize concept erasure methods into fine-tuning for parameter updates, closed-form solutions for efficient edits, and inference-time interventions for content restriction without weight modification. Additionally, we explore adversarial attacks that bypass erasure techniques and discuss emerging defenses. To support further research, we consolidate key datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks for assessing erasure effectiveness and model robustness. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into the evolving landscape of concept erasure, its challenges, and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Liu, Chen-Wei Xie, Bin Wen, Feiwu Yu, Jixuan Chen, Pandeng Li, Boqiang Zhang, Nianzu Yang, Yinglu Li, Zuan Gao, Yun Zheng, Hongtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Lange, Max Hamilton, Elijah Cole, Alexander Shepard, Samuel Heinrich, Angela Zhu, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowing where a particular species can or cannot be found on Earth is crucial for ecological research and conservation efforts. By mapping the spatial ranges of all species, we would obtain deeper insights into how global biodiversity is affected by climate change and habitat loss. However, accurate range estimates are only available for a relatively small proportion of all known species. For the majority of the remaining species, we typically only have a small number of records denoting the spatial locations where they have previously been observed. We outline a new approach for few-shot species range estimation to address the challenge of accurately estimating the range of a species from limited data. During inference, our model takes a set of spatial locations as input, along with optional metadata such as text or an image, and outputs a species encoding that can be used to predict the range of a previously unseen species in a feedforward manner. We evaluate our approach on two challenging benchmarks, where we obtain state-of-the-art range estimation performance, in a fraction of the compute time, compared to recent alternative approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben T. Lucassen, Tijn van de Luijtgaarden, Sander P. J. Moonemans, Gerben E. Breimer, Willeke A. M. Blokx, Mitko Veta</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbing Zhang, Bing Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) problem aims to reconstruct a tensor from partial sample information, which has attracted significant interest in a wide range of practical applications such as image processing and computer vision. Among the various techniques employed for the LRTC problem, non-convex relaxation methods have been widely studied for their effectiveness in handling tensor singular values, which are crucial for accurate tensor recovery. While the minimax concave penalty (MCP) non-convex relaxation method has achieved promising results in tackling the LRTC problem and gained widely adopted, it exhibits a notable limitation: insufficient penalty on small singular values during the singular value handling process, resulting in inefficient tensor recovery. To address this issue and enhance recovery performance, a novel minimax $p$-th order concave penalty (MPCP) function is proposed. Based on this novel function, a tensor $p$-th order $\tau$ norm is proposed as a non-convex relaxation for tensor rank approximation, thereby establishing an MPCP-based LRTC model. Furthermore, theoretical convergence guarantees are rigorously established for the proposed method. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianwen Sun, Yukang Feng, Chuanhao Li, Fanrui Zhang, Zizhen Li, Jiaxin Ai, Sizhuo Zhou, Yu Dai, Shenglin Zhang, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation have recently received much attention in the area of vision and language. Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruchi Bhatt, Shreya Bansal, Amanpreet Chander, Rupinder Kaur, Malya Singh, Mohan Kankanhalli, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik, Mukesh Kumar Saini</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding plant growth dynamics is essential for applications in agriculture and plant phenotyping. We present the Growth Modelling (GroMo) challenge, which is designed for two primary tasks: (1) plant age prediction and (2) leaf count estimation, both essential for crop monitoring and precision agriculture. For this challenge, we introduce GroMo25, a dataset with images of four crops: radish, okra, wheat, and mustard. Each crop consists of multiple plants (p1, p2, ..., pn) captured over different days (d1, d2, ..., dm) and categorized into five levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5). Each plant is captured from 24 different angles with a 15-degree gap between images. Participants are required to perform both tasks for all four crops with these multiview images. We proposed a Multiview Vision Transformer (MVVT) model for the GroMo challenge and evaluated the crop-wise performance on GroMo25. MVVT reports an average MAE of 7.74 for age prediction and an MAE of 5.52 for leaf count. The GroMo Challenge aims to advance plant phenotyping research by encouraging innovative solutions for tracking and predicting plant growth.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485">TT-Occ: Test-Time Compute for Self-Supervised Occupancy via Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyi Zhang, Huitong Yang, Zheng Zhang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VLMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VLMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VLMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VLM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions.

<p>Abstract: We address key limitations in existing datasets and models for task-oriented hand-object interaction video generation, a critical approach of generating video demonstrations for robotic imitation learning. Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset is publicly available to foster further advancements in the field, TASTE-Rob dataset and source code will be made publicly available on our website https://taste-rob.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Di Piazza, Carole Lazarus, Olivier Nempont, Loic Boussel</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of Computed Tomography (CT) scan examinations has created an urgent need for automated tools, such as organ segmentation, anomaly classification, and report generation, to assist radiologists with their growing workload. Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Pach, Shyamgopal Karthik, Quentin Bouniot, Serge Belongie, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Given that interpretability and steerability are crucial to AI safety, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a tool to enhance them in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in vision representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Notably, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sami Arja, Nimrod Kruger, Alexandre Marcireau, Nicholas Owen Ralph, Saeed Afshar, Gregory Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cephalopods exhibit unique colour discrimination capabilities despite having one type of photoreceptor, relying instead on chromatic aberration induced by their ocular optics and pupil shapes to perceive spectral information. We took inspiration from this biological mechanism to design a spectral imaging system that combines a ball lens with an event-based camera. Our approach relies on a motorised system that shifts the focal position, mirroring the adaptive lens motion in cephalopods. This approach has enabled us to achieve wavelength-dependent focusing across the visible light and near-infrared spectrum, making the event a spectral sensor. We characterise chromatic aberration effects, using both event-based and conventional frame-based sensors, validating the effectiveness of bio-inspired spectral discrimination both in simulation and in a real setup as well as assessing the spectral discrimination performance. Our proposed approach provides a robust spectral sensing capability without conventional colour filters or computational demosaicing. This approach opens new pathways toward new spectral sensing systems inspired by nature's evolutionary solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linlin Xiao, Zhang Tiancong, Yutong Jia, Xinyu Nie, Mengyao Wang, Xiaohang Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, crop classification and health detection based on deep learning have gradually become a research hotspot. However, the existing target detection methods show poor performance when dealing with small targets in remote sensing images, especially in the case of complex background and image mixing, which is difficult to meet the practical application requirementsite. To address this problem, a novel target detection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the latest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by introducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient multi-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional feature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively enhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small target detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone network solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the contrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex scenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection dataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the recall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\% or so compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly improved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by about 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and efficiency. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and application potential of YOLO-RS in the task of detecting small targets in remote sensing images.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively addresses the vanishing advantages dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini.

<p>Abstract: Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingling Shu, Sibao Chen, Zhihui You, Wei Lu, Jin Tang, Bin Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid modernization of urban transportation, accurately detecting changes such as road and bridge construction, renovation, and demolition is crucial for urban planning and traffic management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained semantic changes in complex traffic scenes, largely due to the lack of high-quality annotated change detection (CD) datasets. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images. RB-SCD spans diverse geographic areas and includes a wide variety of road and bridge types across over ten cities in multiple countries. It covers 11 distinct categories of semantic changes, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Based on this challenging dataset, we propose a novel framework called the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). For the first time, MFDCD integrates multimodal feature characteristics in the frequency domain. It comprises two key components: the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) and the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF). DFC couples hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, enhancing the perception of fine-grained and cross-temporal structural changes. TFF transforms textual features extracted by the CLIP model into the frequency domain via Fourier transform and applies graph-based filtering to extract salient frequency responses. These are then fused with visual features to enable effective multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments show that MFDCD achieves strong performance on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks. The RB-SCD dataset, with its rich and diverse annotations, serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in road and bridge change detection under complex traffic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitish Shukla, Arun Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two face images corresponding to two identities to produce a composite that successfully matches both the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference images. Previous RF demorphing methods are overly constrained, as they rely on assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the morphing technique used (e.g., landmark-based) and face image style (e.g., passport photos). In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach, referred to as diffDeMorph, that effectively disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriram M S, Xinyue Hao, Shihao Hou, Yang Lu, Laura Sevilla-Lara, Anurag Arnab, Shreyank N Gowda</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seun-An Choe, Keon-Hee Park, Jinwoo Choi, Gyeong-Moon Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniMAP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Devkota, Annahita Amireskandari, Joel Palko, Shyam Thakkar, Donald Adjeroh, Xiajun Jiang, Binod Bhattarai, Prashnna K. Gyawali</p>
<p>Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms, assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated, privacy-preserving setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehan Wang, Jiayang Xu, Ziang Zhang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Hengshuang Zhao, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro C. Neto, Naser Damer, Jaime S. Cardoso, Ana F. Sequeira</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years, researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view. However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space. We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of the original datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to strong learning abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they have become mainstream methods for image super-resolution. However, there are big differences of different deep learning methods with different types. There is little literature to summarize relations and differences of different methods in image super-resolution. Thus, summarizing these literatures are important, according to loading capacity and execution speed of devices. This paper first introduces principles of CNNs in image super-resolution, then introduces CNNs based bicubic interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution, sub-pixel layer, meta up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research points and drawbacks and summarizes the whole paper, which can facilitate developments of CNNs in image super-resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhong Lu, Qichao Wang, Hengyuan Cao, Xiaoyin Xu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model, enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications. Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

<p>Abstract: We present SemiOccam, an image recognition network that leverages semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often rely on complex training techniques and architectures, requiring hundreds of GPU hours for training, while their generalization ability when dealing with extremely limited labeled data remains to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical mixture density classification decision mechanism by optimizing mutual information between feature representations and target classes, compressing redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets when using negligible labeled samples, and its simple architecture keeps training time to minute-level. Notably, this paper reveals a long-overlooked data leakage issue in the STL-10 dataset for semi-supervised learning tasks and removes duplicates to ensure the reliability of experimental results. We also release the deduplicated CleanSTL-10 dataset to facilitate fair and reliable research in future semi-supervised learning. Code available at https://github.com/Shu1L0n9/SemiOccam.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in middle-aged groups.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization. We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takayuki Komatsu, Yoshiyuki Ohmura, Kayato Nishitsunoi, Yasuo Kuniyoshi</p>
<p>Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background, which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background. We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Kennerley, Angelica Aviles-Rivero, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Robby T. Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT), a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector. LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations. Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over semi-supervised baselines.</p>

Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and reward losses. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real/synthetic image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).</p>

<p>Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs) while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods (<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Li, Yanpeng Zhou, Yufei Gao, Tao Tang, Jianhua Han, Yujie Yuan, Dave Zhenyu Chen, Jiawang Bian, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures, allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alan Dolhasz, Chen Ma, Dave Gausebeck, Kevin Chen, Gregor Miller, Lucas Hayne, Gunnar Hovden, Azwad Sabik, Olaf Brandt, Mira Slavcheva</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images. To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Peishan Yang, Zhen Xu, Jiaming Sun, Zhanhua Zhang, Yong Chen, Hujun Bao, Sida Peng, Xiaowei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin. Project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/freetimegs/ .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Jee-weon Jung, Hyeongseop Rha, Soumi Maiti, Siddhant Arora, Xuankai Chang, Shinji Watanabe, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability to jointly process multi-modal information is becoming an essential task. However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunbei Zhang, Akshay Mehra, Shuaicheng Niu, Jihun Hamm</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to adapt source pre-trained models to continually changing, unseen target domains. While existing CTTA methods assume structured domain changes with uniform durations, real-world environments often exhibit dynamic patterns where domains recur with varying frequencies and durations. Current approaches, which adapt the same parameters across different domains, struggle in such dynamic conditions-they face convergence issues with brief domain exposures, risk forgetting previously learned knowledge, or misapplying it to irrelevant domains. To remedy this, we propose DPCore, a method designed for robust performance across diverse domain change patterns while ensuring computational efficiency. DPCore integrates three key components: Visual Prompt Adaptation for efficient domain alignment, a Prompt Coreset for knowledge preservation, and a Dynamic Update mechanism that intelligently adjusts existing prompts for similar domains while creating new ones for substantially different domains. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DPCore consistently outperforms various CTTA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both structured and dynamic settings while reducing trainable parameters by 99% and computation time by 64% compared to previous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaotian Weng, Zijun Gao, Jerone Andrews, Jieyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Tang, Jingwei Guan, Linge Li, Ran Shi, Youmei Zhang, Mengye Lyu, Li Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, as powerful generative models, have found a wide range of applications and shown great potential in solving image reconstruction problems. Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over standard EI counterpart in single-input setting and network adaptation at test time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Junlong Li, Xiwen Zhang, Fan Zhou, Yu Cheng, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-evolving trainin--where models iteratively learn from their own outputs--has emerged as a key approach for complex reasoning tasks, addressing the scarcity of high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remains limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability. Inspired by reinforcement learning (RL), in this paper, we reframe self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning through the lens of RL, identifying three pivotal factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. Through systematic analysis, we establish relatively optimal design principles that significantly enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities. Moreover, delving deeper into training dynamics, we uncover the roots of saturation and propose a new automatic balancing mechanism to mitigate this limitation. Building on these insights, we propose M-STAR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), a framework that achieves consistent performance gains across models of varying sizes and diverse benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/MedXpertQA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengzhi Li, Megan Tjandrasuwita, Yi R. Fung, Armando Solar-Lezama, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities, socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Zhang, Chendong Xiang, Haofeng Huang, Jia Wei, Haocheng Xi, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungyeon Kim, Xinliang Zhu, Xiaofan Lin, Muhammet Bastan, Douglas Gray, Suha Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative retrieval is an emerging approach in information retrieval that generates identifiers (IDs) of target data based on a query, providing an efficient alternative to traditional embedding-based retrieval methods. However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that accelerates the discovery of actionable relationships in high-dimensional temporal data by integrating machine learning (ML), explainable AI (XAI), and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance data quality and streamline workflows. Traditional methods often fail to recognize complex temporal relationships, leading to noisy, redundant, or biased datasets.

Evaluated on real-world agricultural and synthetic datasets, the framework significantly improves performance metrics (e.g., MSE, R2, MAE) and computational efficiency, with hardware-agnostic scalability across diverse platforms. While long-term real-world impacts (e.g., cost savings, sustainability gains) are pending, this methodology provides an immediate pathway to accelerate data-centric AI in dynamic domains like agriculture and energy, enabling faster iteration cycles for domain experts.</p>

In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.</p>

<p>Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.</p>

SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss.

<p>Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning (MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU) still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially for preservation and robustness.
