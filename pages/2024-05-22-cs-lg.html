<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobin Zhang, Zhuang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms, particularly stochastic policy gradient (SPG), report significant success in reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, up to now, that how to speedily acquire an optimal solution for RL is still a challenge. To tackle this issue, this work develops a fast SPG algorithm from the perspective of utilizing a momentum, coined SPG-NM. Specifically, in SPG-NM, a novel type of the negative momentum (NM) technique is applied into the classical SPG algorithm. Different from the existing NM techniques, we have adopted a few hyper-parameters in our SPG-NM algorithm. Moreover, the computational complexity is nearly same as the modern SPG-type algorithms, e.g., accelerated policy gradient (APG), which equips SPG with Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG). We evaluate the resulting algorithm on two classical tasks, bandit setting and Markov decision process (MDP). Numerical results in different tasks demonstrate faster convergence rate of the resulting algorithm by comparing state-of-the-art algorithms, which confirm the positive impact of NM in accelerating SPG for RL. Also, numerical experiments under different settings confirm the robustness of our SPG-NM algorithm for some certain crucial hyper-parameters, which ride the user feel free in practice.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235">Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel T. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi He, Max A. Little</p>
<p>Abstract: The $K$-medoids problem is a challenging combinatorial clustering task, widely used in data analysis applications. While numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, none of these are able to obtain an exact (globally optimal) solution for the problem in polynomial time. In this paper, we present EKM: a novel algorithm for solving this problem exactly with worst-case $O\left(N^{K+1}\right)$ time complexity. EKM is developed according to recent advances in transformational programming and combinatorial generation, using formal program derivation steps. The derived algorithm is provably correct by construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it against various approximate methods on numerous real-world datasets. We show that the wall-clock run time of our algorithm matches the worst-case time complexity analysis on synthetic datasets, clearly outperforming the exponential time complexity of benchmark branch-and-bound based MIP solvers. To our knowledge, this is the first, rigorously-proven polynomial time, practical algorithm for this ubiquitous problem.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12241">Identifying Functionally Important Features with End-to-End Sparse Dictionary Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Braun, Jordan Taylor, Nicholas Goldowsky-Dill, Lee Sharkey</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately. We release our library for training e2e SAEs and reproducing our analysis at https://github.com/ApolloResearch/e2e_sae</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Razzhigaev, Matvey Mikhalchuk, Elizaveta Goncharova, Nikolai Gerasimenko, Ivan Oseledets, Denis Dimitrov, Andrey Kuznetsov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper reveals a novel linear characteristic exclusive to transformer decoders, including models such as GPT, LLaMA, OPT, BLOOM and others. We analyze embedding transformations between sequential layers, uncovering a near-perfect linear relationship (Procrustes similarity score of 0.99). However, linearity decreases when the residual component is removed due to a consistently low output norm of the transformer layer. Our experiments show that removing or linearly approximating some of the most linear blocks of transformers does not affect significantly the loss or model performance. Moreover, in our pretraining experiments on smaller models we introduce a cosine-similarity-based regularization, aimed at reducing layer linearity. This regularization improves performance metrics on benchmarks like Tiny Stories and SuperGLUE and as well successfully decreases the linearity of the models. This study challenges the existing understanding of transformer architectures, suggesting that their operation may be more linear than previously assumed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana Nikolikj, Ana Kostovska, Gjorgjina Cenikj, Carola Doerr, Tome Eftimov</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the generalization ability of algorithm performance prediction models across various benchmark suites. Comparing the statistical similarity between the problem collections with the accuracy of performance prediction models that are based on exploratory landscape analysis features, we observe that there is a positive correlation between these two measures. Specifically, when the high-dimensional feature value distributions between training and testing suites lack statistical significance, the model tends to generalize well, in the sense that the testing errors are in the same range as the training errors. Two experiments validate these findings: one involving the standard benchmark suites, the BBOB and CEC collections, and another using five collections of affine combinations of BBOB problem instances.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolving landscape of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to improve the interpretability of intricate machine learning (ML) models, yet faces challenges in formalisation and empirical validation, being an inherently unsupervised process. In this paper, we bring together various benchmark datasets and novel performance metrics in an initial benchmarking platform, the Explainable AI Comparison Toolkit (EXACT), providing a standardised foundation for evaluating XAI methods. Our datasets incorporate ground truth explanations for class-conditional features, and leveraging novel quantitative metrics, this platform assesses the performance of post-hoc XAI methods in the quality of the explanations they produce. Our recent findings have highlighted the limitations of popular XAI methods, as they often struggle to surpass random baselines, attributing significance to irrelevant features. Moreover, we show the variability in explanations derived from different equally performing model architectures. This initial benchmarking platform therefore aims to allow XAI researchers to test and assure the high quality of their newly developed methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12262">Prompt Learning for Generalized Vehicle Routing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Liu, Xi Lin, Weiduo Liao, Zhenkun Wang, Qingfu Zhang, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach to solving various vehicle routing problems without much manual algorithm design. However, the current NCO methods mainly focus on the in-distribution performance, while the real-world problem instances usually come from different distributions. A costly fine-tuning approach or generalized model retraining from scratch could be needed to tackle the out-of-distribution instances. Unlike the existing methods, this work investigates an efficient prompt learning approach in NCO for cross-distribution adaptation. To be concrete, we propose a novel prompt learning method to facilitate fast zero-shot adaptation of a pre-trained model to solve routing problem instances from different distributions. The proposed model learns a set of prompts among various distributions and then selects the best-matched one to prompt a pre-trained attention model for each problem instance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed prompt learning approach facilitates the fast adaptation of pre-trained routing models. It also outperforms existing generalized models on both in-distribution prediction and zero-shot generalization to a diverse set of new tasks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12264">Directed Metric Structures arising in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> St\'ephane Gaubert, Yiannis Vlassopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are transformer neural networks which are trained to produce a probability distribution on the possible next words to given texts in a corpus, in such a way that the most likely word predicted is the actual word in the training text. In this paper we find what is the mathematical structure defined by such conditional probability distributions of text extensions. Changing the view point from probabilities to -log probabilities we observe that the subtext order is completely encoded in a metric structure defined on the space of texts $\mathcal{L}$, by -log probabilities. We then construct a metric polyhedron $P(\mathcal{L})$ and an isometric embedding (called Yoneda embedding) of $\mathcal{L}$ into $P(\mathcal{L})$ such that texts map to generators of certain special extremal rays. We explain that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is a $(\min,+)$ (tropical) linear span of these extremal ray generators. The generators also satisfy a system of $(\min+)$ linear equations. We then show that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is compatible with adding more text and from this we derive an approximation of a text vector as a Boltzmann weighted linear combination of the vectors for words in that text. We then prove a duality theorem showing that texts extensions and text restrictions give isometric polyhedra (even though they look a priory very different). Moreover we prove that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is the lattice closure of (a version of) the so called, Isbell completion of $\mathcal{L}$ which turns out to be the $(\max,+)$ span of the text extremal ray generators. All constructions have interpretations in category theory but we don't use category theory explicitly. The categorical interpretations are briefly explained in an appendix. In the final appendix we describe how the syntax to semantics problem could fit in a general well known mathematical duality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12295">Efficient Model-Stealing Attacks Against Inductive Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Podhajski, Jan Dubi\'nski, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic, Agnieszka Pregowska, Tomasz Michalak</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recognized as potent tools for processing real-world data organized in graph structures. Especially inductive GNNs, which enable the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are gaining importance in an increasingly wide variety of applications. As these networks demonstrate proficiency across a range of tasks, they become lucrative targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. A large effort has been made to develop model-stealing attacks that focus on models trained with images and texts. However, little attention has been paid to GNNs trained on graph data. This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, based on graph contrasting learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the target model. The proposed attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets. The results show that this approach demonstrates a higher level of efficiency compared to existing stealing attacks. More concretely, our attack outperforms the baseline on all benchmarks achieving higher fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while requiring fewer queries sent to the target model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manas Gogoi, Sambhavi Tiwari, Shekhar Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: The reason for Meta Overfitting can be attributed to two factors: Mutual Non-exclusivity and the Lack of diversity, consequent to which a single global function can fit the support set data of all the meta-training tasks and fail to generalize to new unseen tasks. This issue is evidenced by low error rates on the meta-training tasks, but high error rates on new tasks. However, there can be a number of novel solutions to this problem keeping in mind any of the two objectives to be attained, i.e. to increase diversity in the tasks and to reduce the confidence of the model for some of the tasks. In light of the above, this paper proposes a number of solutions to tackle meta-overfitting on few-shot learning settings, such as few-shot sinusoid regression and few shot classification. Our proposed approaches demonstrate improved generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for learning in a non-mutually exclusive task setting. Overall, this paper aims to provide insights into tackling overfitting in meta-learning and to advance the field towards more robust and generalizable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Lozano-Cuadra, Beatriz Soret, Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Petar Popovski</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a full solution for decentralized routing in Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations based on continual Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This requires addressing multiple challenges, including the partial knowledge at the satellites and their continuous movement, and the time-varying sources of uncertainty in the system, such as traffic, communication links, or communication buffers. We follow a multi-agent approach, where each satellite acts as an independent decision-making agent, while acquiring a limited knowledge of the environment based on the feedback received from the nearby agents. The solution is divided into two phases. First, an offline learning phase relies on decentralized decisions and a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained with global experiences. Then, the online phase with local, on-board, and pre-trained DNNs requires continual learning to evolve with the environment, which can be done in two different ways: (1) Model anticipation, where the predictable conditions of the constellation are exploited by each satellite sharing local model with the next satellite; and (2) Federated Learning (FL), where each agent's model is merged first at the cluster level and then aggregated in a global Parameter Server. The results show that, without high congestion, the proposed Multi-Agent DRL framework achieves the same E2E performance as a shortest-path solution, but the latter assumes intensive communication overhead for real-time network-wise knowledge of the system at a centralized node, whereas ours only requires limited feedback exchange among first neighbour satellites. Importantly, our solution adapts well to congestion conditions and exploits less loaded paths. Moreover, the divergence of models over time is easily tackled by the synergy between anticipation, applied in short-term alignment, and FL, utilized for long-term alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Scarone, Alfredo Viola, Ricardo Baeza-Yates</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of machine learning and data-driven algorithms for decision making has been steadily increasing over many years. The areas in which this is happening are diverse: healthcare, employment, finance, education, the legal system to name a few; and the associated negative side effects are being increasingly harmful for society. Negative data \emph{bias} is one of those, which tends to result in harmful consequences for specific groups of people. Any mitigation strategy or effective policy that addresses the negative consequences of bias must start with awareness that bias exists, together with a way to understand and quantify it. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure data bias and oftentimes the intended meaning is context dependent and not uniform within the research community. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a general algorithmic framework for defining and efficiently quantifying the bias level of a dataset with respect to a protected group; and (2) the definition of a new bias measure. Our results are experimentally validated using nine publicly available datasets and theoretically analyzed, which provide novel insights about the problem. Based on our approach, we also derive a bias mitigation algorithm that might be useful to policymakers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henri Manninen, Markus Lippus, Georg Rute</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) systems are crucial for renewable energy integration in transmission networks. However, traditional methods relying on sensor data face challenges due to the impracticality of installing sensors on every pole or span. Additionally, sensor-based approaches may struggle predicting DLR in rapidly changing weather conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques alongside hyper-local weather forecast data. Unlike conventional methods, which solely rely on sensor data, this approach utilizes ML models trained to predict hyper-local weather parameters on a full network scale. Integrating topographical data enhances prediction accuracy by accounting for landscape features and obstacles around overhead lines. The paper introduces confidence intervals for DLR assessments to mitigate risks associated with uncertainties. A case study from Estonia demonstrates the practical implementation of the proposed methodology, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By addressing limitations of sensor-based approaches, this research contributes to the discourse of renewable energy integration in transmission systems, advancing efficiency and reliability in the power grid.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a pivotal research domain aimed at understanding the operational mechanisms of AI systems, particularly those considered ``black boxes'' due to their complex, opaque nature. XAI seeks to make these AI systems more understandable and trustworthy, providing insight into their decision-making processes. By producing clear and comprehensible explanations, XAI enables users, practitioners, and stakeholders to trust a model's decisions. This work analyses the value of data morphology strategies in generating counterfactual explanations. It introduces the Overlap Number of Balls Model-Agnostic CounterFactuals (ONB-MACF) method, a model-agnostic counterfactual generator that leverages data morphology to estimate a model's decision boundaries. The ONB-MACF method constructs hyperspheres in the data space whose covered points share a class, mapping the decision boundary. Counterfactuals are then generated by incrementally adjusting an instance's attributes towards the nearest alternate-class hypersphere, crossing the decision boundary with minimal modifications. By design, the ONB-MACF method generates feasible and sparse counterfactuals that follow the data distribution. Our comprehensive benchmark from a double perspective (quantitative and qualitative) shows that the ONB-MACF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods across multiple quality metrics on diverse tabular datasets. This supports our hypothesis, showcasing the potential of data-morphology-based explainability strategies for trustworthy AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Fatemi, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Elena Zheleva</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of interference, where the outcome of an individual may depend on the treatment assignment and behavior of neighboring nodes, can lead to biased causal effect estimation. Current approaches to network experiment design focus on limiting interference through cluster-based randomization, in which clusters are identified using graph clustering, and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control. However, cluster-based randomization approaches perform poorly when interference propagates in cascades, whereby the response of individuals to treatment propagates to their multi-hop neighbors. When we have knowledge of the cascade seed nodes, we can leverage this interference structure to mitigate the resulting causal effect estimation bias. With this goal, we propose a cascade-based network experiment design that initiates treatment assignment from the cascade seed node and propagates the assignment to their multi-hop neighbors to limit interference during cascade growth and thereby reduce the overall causal effect estimation error. Our extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in estimating causal effects in network data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasib-Al Rashid, Tinoosh Mohsenin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has led to a notable increase in energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions, intensifying concerns about climate change. This growing problem has brought the environmental sustainability of AI technologies to the forefront, especially as they expand across various sectors. In response to these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development of sustainable AI solutions. These solutions must focus on energy-efficient embedded systems that are capable of handling diverse data types even in environments with limited resources, thereby ensuring both technological progress and environmental responsibility. Integrating complementary multimodal data into tiny machine learning models for edge devices is challenging due to increased complexity, latency, and power consumption. This work introduces TinyM$^2$Net-V3, a system that processes different modalities of complementary data, designs deep neural network (DNN) models, and employs model compression techniques including knowledge distillation and low bit-width quantization with memory-aware considerations to fit models within lower memory hierarchy levels, reducing latency and enhancing energy efficiency on resource-constrained devices. We evaluated TinyM$^2$Net-V3 in two multimodal case studies: COVID-19 detection using cough, speech, and breathing audios, and pose classification from depth and thermal images. With tiny inference models (6 KB and 58 KB), we achieved 92.95% and 90.7% accuracies, respectively. Our tiny machine learning models, deployed on resource limited hardware, demonstrated low latencies within milliseconds and very high power efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Hamilton, Kyle Dunlap, Kerianne L. Hobbs</p>
<p>Abstract: For many space applications, traditional control methods are often used during operation. However, as the number of space assets continues to grow, autonomous operation can enable rapid development of control methods for different space related tasks. One method of developing autonomous control is Reinforcement Learning (RL), which has become increasingly popular after demonstrating promising performance and success across many complex tasks. While it is common for RL agents to learn bounded continuous control values, this may not be realistic or practical for many space tasks that traditionally prefer an on/off approach for control. This paper analyzes using discrete action spaces, where the agent must choose from a predefined list of actions. The experiments explore how the number of choices provided to the agents affects their measured performance during and after training. This analysis is conducted for an inspection task, where the agent must circumnavigate an object to inspect points on its surface, and a docking task, where the agent must move into proximity of another spacecraft and "dock" with a low relative speed. A common objective of both tasks, and most space tasks in general, is to minimize fuel usage, which motivates the agent to regularly choose an action that uses no fuel. Our results show that a limited number of discrete choices leads to optimal performance for the inspection task, while continuous control leads to optimal performance for the docking task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Vasquez, Carlotta Domeniconi, Huzefa Rangwala</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms (ML) impact virtually every aspect of human lives and have found use across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education. Often, ML algorithms have been found to exacerbate societal biases presented in datasets, leading to adversarial impacts on subsets/groups of individuals, in many cases minority groups. To effectively mitigate these untoward effects, it is crucial that disparities/biases are identified and assessed early in a ML pipeline. This proactive approach facilitates timely interventions to prevent bias amplification and reduce complexity at later stages of model development. In this paper, we introduce DispaRisk, a novel framework designed to proactively assess the potential risks of disparities in datasets during the initial stages of the ML pipeline. We evaluate DispaRisk's effectiveness by benchmarking it with commonly used datasets in fairness research. Our findings demonstrate the capabilities of DispaRisk to identify datasets with a high-risk of discrimination, model families prone to biases, and characteristics that heighten discrimination susceptibility in a ML pipeline. The code for our experiments is available in the following repository: https://github.com/jovasque156/disparisk</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongren Zou, Adar Kahana, Enrui Zhang, Eli Turkel, Rishikesh Ranade, Jay Pathak, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend a recently proposed machine-learning-based iterative solver, i.e. the hybrid iterative transferable solver (HINTS), to solve the scattering problem described by the Helmholtz equation in an exterior domain with a complex absorbing boundary condition. The HINTS method combines neural operators (NOs) with standard iterative solvers, e.g. Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel (GS), to achieve better performance by leveraging the spectral bias of neural networks. In HINTS, some iterations of the conventional iterative method are replaced by inferences of the pre-trained NO. In this work, we employ HINTS to solve the scattering problem for both 2D and 3D problems, where the standard iterative solver fails. We consider square and triangular scatterers of various sizes in 2D, and a cube and a model submarine in 3D. We explore and illustrate the extrapolation capability of HINTS in handling diverse geometries of the scatterer, which is achieved by training the NO on non-scattering scenarios and then deploying it in HINTS to solve scattering problems. The accurate results demonstrate that the NO in HINTS method remains effective without retraining or fine-tuning it whenever a new scatterer is given. Taken together, our results highlight the adaptability and versatility of the extended HINTS methodology in addressing diverse scattering problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12382">Stochastic Reservoir Computers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12387">Conformal Counterfactual Inference under Hidden Confounding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghao Chen, Ruocheng Guo, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Ton, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized decision making requires the knowledge of potential outcomes under different treatments, and confidence intervals about the potential outcomes further enrich this decision-making process and improve its reliability in high-stakes scenarios. Predicting potential outcomes along with its uncertainty in a counterfactual world poses the foundamental challenge in causal inference. Existing methods that construct confidence intervals for counterfactuals either rely on the assumption of strong ignorability, or need access to un-identifiable lower and upper bounds that characterize the difference between observational and interventional distributions. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel approach wTCP-DR based on transductive weighted conformal prediction, which provides confidence intervals for counterfactual outcomes with marginal converage guarantees, even under hidden confounding. With less restrictive assumptions, our approach requires access to a fraction of interventional data (from randomized controlled trials) to account for the covariate shift from observational distributoin to interventional distribution. Theoretical results explicitly demonstrate the conditions under which our algorithm is strictly advantageous to the naive method that only uses interventional data. After ensuring valid intervals on counterfactuals, it is straightforward to construct intervals for individual treatment effects (ITEs). We demonstrate our method across synthetic and real-world data, including recommendation systems, to verify the superiority of our methods compared against state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both coverage and efficiency</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Chun Lok Li, Steven Tin Sui Luo, Le Xu, Ngai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Coordinate network or implicit neural representation (INR) is a fast-emerging method for encoding natural signals (such as images and videos) with the benefits of a compact neural representation. While numerous methods have been proposed to increase the encoding capabilities of an INR, an often overlooked aspect is the inference efficiency, usually measured in multiply-accumulate (MAC) count. This is particularly critical in use cases where inference throughput is greatly limited by hardware constraints. To this end, we propose the Activation-Sharing Multi-Resolution (ASMR) coordinate network that combines multi-resolution coordinate decomposition with hierarchical modulations. Specifically, an ASMR model enables the sharing of activations across grids of the data. This largely decouples its inference cost from its depth which is directly correlated to its reconstruction capability, and renders a near O(1) inference complexity irrespective of the number of layers. Experiments show that ASMR can reduce the MAC of a vanilla SIREN model by up to 500x while achieving an even higher reconstruction quality than its SIREN baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eloi Alonso, Adam Jelley, Vincent Micheli, Anssi Kanervisto, Amos Storkey, Tim Pearce, Fran\c{c}ois Fleuret</p>
<p>Abstract: World models constitute a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents in a safe and sample-efficient manner. Recent world models predominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete representation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement learning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for image generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete latents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a diffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to make diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual details can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best for agents trained entirely within a world model. To foster future research on diffusion for world modeling, we release our code, agents and playable world models at https://github.com/eloialonso/diamond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spencer Young, Porter Jenkins</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, accurately representing uncertainty is crucial for enhancing their safety, robustness, and reliability. Training neural networks to fit high-dimensional probability distributions via maximum likelihood has become an effective method for uncertainty quantification. However, such models often exhibit poor calibration, leading to overconfident predictions. Traditional metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) have limitations, including biases and parametric assumptions. This paper proposes a new approach using conditional kernel mean embeddings to measure calibration discrepancies without these biases and assumptions. Preliminary experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the method's potential, with future work planned for more complex applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kihyun Kim, Jiawei Zhang, Pablo A. Parrilo, Asuman Ozdaglar</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are pivotal methodologies in reward learning, which involve inferring and shaping the underlying reward function of sequential decision-making problems based on observed human demonstrations and feedback. Most prior work in reward learning has relied on prior knowledge or assumptions about decision or preference models, potentially leading to robustness issues. In response, this paper introduces a novel linear programming (LP) framework tailored for offline reward learning. Utilizing pre-collected trajectories without online exploration, this framework estimates a feasible reward set from the primal-dual optimality conditions of a suitably designed LP, and offers an optimality guarantee with provable sample efficiency. Our LP framework also enables aligning the reward functions with human feedback, such as pairwise trajectory comparison data, while maintaining computational tractability and sample efficiency. We demonstrate that our framework potentially achieves better performance compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach through analytical examples and numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samrah Arif, Muhammad Arif Khan, Sabih Ur Rehman</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly growing development of the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, achieving reliable wireless communication is a challenge. IoT devices operate in diverse environments with common signal interference and fluctuating channel conditions. Accurate channel estimation helps adapt the transmission strategies to current conditions, ensuring reliable communication. Traditional methods, such as Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimation techniques, often struggle to adapt to the diverse and complex environments typical of IoT networks. This research article delves into the potential of Deep Learning (DL) to enhance channel estimation, focusing on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) metric - a critical yet challenging aspect due to its susceptibility to noise and environmental factors. This paper presents two Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs)-based Low Power (LP-IoT) channel estimation models, leveraging RSSI for accurate channel estimation in LP-IoT communication. Our Model A exhibits a remarkable 99.02% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Model B demonstrates a notable 90.03% MSE reduction compared to the benchmarks set by current studies. Additionally, the comparative studies of our model A with other DL-based techniques show significant efficiency in our estimation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taihei Oki, Shinsaku Sakaue</p>
<p>Abstract: M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions. A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$ unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$. Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel idea in the context of online learning.</p>

During training, labels accompany input data, classifying them as positive or negative inputs. Each layer learns its response to these inputs independently. In this study, we enhance the FFL with the following contributions: 1) We optimize label processing by segregating label and feature forwarding between layers, enhancing learning performance. 2) By revising label integration, we enhance the inference process, reduce computational complexity, and improve performance. 3) We introduce feedback loops akin to cortical loops in the brain, where information cycles through and returns to earlier neurons, enabling layers to combine complex features from previous layers with lower-level features, enhancing learning efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have demonstrated efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhou, Yan Lin, Haomin Wen, Shengnan Guo, Jilin Hu, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal trajectories play a vital role in various spatio-temporal data mining tasks. Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them.
  To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Yamazaki, Ali Harandi, Mayu Muramatsu, Alexandre Viardin, Markus Apel, Tim Brepols, Stefanie Reese, Shahed Rezaei</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel finite element-based physics-informed operator learning framework that allows for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework employs a loss function inspired by the finite element method (FEM) with the implicit Euler time integration scheme. A transient thermal conduction problem is considered to benchmark the performance. The proposed operator learning framework takes a temperature field at the current time step as input and predicts a temperature field at the next time step. The Galerkin discretized weak formulation of the heat equation is employed to incorporate physics into the loss function, which is coined finite operator learning (FOL). Upon training, the networks successfully predict the temperature evolution over time for any initial temperature field at high accuracy compared to the FEM solution. The framework is also confirmed to be applicable to a heterogeneous thermal conductivity and arbitrary geometry. The advantages of FOL can be summarized as follows: First, the training is performed in an unsupervised manner, avoiding the need for a large data set prepared from costly simulations or experiments. Instead, random temperature patterns generated by the Gaussian random process and the Fourier series, combined with constant temperature fields, are used as training data to cover possible temperature cases. Second, shape functions and backward difference approximation are exploited for the domain discretization, resulting in a purely algebraic equation. This enhances training efficiency, as one avoids time-consuming automatic differentiation when optimizing weights and biases while accepting possible discretization errors. Finally, thanks to the interpolation power of FEM, any arbitrary geometry can be handled with FOL, which is crucial to addressing various engineering application scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Huang, Yu Guang Wang, Ming Li, and Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), alternatively known as graph filters, have gained increasing prevalence for heterophily graphs. Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwei Wang, Ruibin Bai, Fazlullah Khan, Ender Ozcan, Tiehua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods have become increasingly popular for solving vehicle routing problems due to their near-optimal performance and fast inference speed. Among them, the combination of deep reinforcement learning and graph representation allows for the abstraction of node topology structures and features in an encoder-decoder style. Such an approach makes it possible to solve routing problems end-to-end without needing complicated heuristic operators designed by domain experts. Existing research studies have been focusing on novel encoding and decoding structures via various neural network models to enhance the node embedding representation. Despite the sophisticated approaches applied, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for the graph-theoretic properties inherent to routing problems. Moreover, the potential ramifications of inter-nodal interactions on the decision-making efficacy of the models have not been adequately explored. To bridge this gap, we propose an adaptive Graph Attention Sampling with the Edges Fusion framework (GASE),where nodes' embedding is determined through attention calculation from certain highly correlated neighbourhoods and edges, utilizing a filtered adjacency matrix. In detail, the selections of particular neighbours and adjacency edges are led by a multi-head attention mechanism, contributing directly to the message passing and node embedding in graph attention sampling networks. Furthermore, we incorporate an adaptive actor-critic algorithm with policy improvements to expedite the training convergence. We then conduct comprehensive experiments against baseline methods on learning-based VRP tasks from different perspectives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin-Chun Li, Jin-Lin Tang, Bo Zhang, Lan Li, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin-Chun Li, Lan Li, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: The loss landscape of deep neural networks (DNNs) is commonly considered complex and wildly fluctuated. However, an interesting observation is that the loss surfaces plotted along Gaussian noise directions are almost v-basin ones with the perturbed model lying on the basin. This motivates us to rethink whether the 1D or 2D subspace could cover more complex local geometry structures, and how to mine the corresponding perturbation directions. This paper systematically and gradually categorizes the 1D curves from simple to complex, including v-basin, v-side, w-basin, w-peak, and vvv-basin curves. Notably, the latter two types are already hard to obtain via the intuitive construction of specific perturbation directions, and we need to propose proper mining algorithms to plot the corresponding 1D curves. Combining these 1D directions, various types of 2D surfaces are visualized such as the saddle surfaces and the bottom of a bottle of wine that are only shown by demo functions in previous works. Finally, we propose theoretical insights from the lens of the Hessian matrix to explain the observed several interesting phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> No\'e Hern\'andez, Rafael Morales, Luis A. Pineda</p>
<p>Abstract: The entropic associative memory (EAM) is a computational model of natural memory incorporating some of its putative properties of being associative, distributed, declarative, abstractive and constructive. Previous experiments satisfactorily tested the model on structured, homogeneous and conventional data: images of manuscripts digits and letters, images of clothing, and phone representations. In this work we show that EAM appropriately stores, recognizes and retrieves complex and unconventional images of animals and vehicles. Additionally, the memory system generates meaningful retrieval association chains for such complex images. The retrieved objects can be seen as proper memories, associated recollections or products of imagination.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12502">EntropyStop: Unsupervised Deep Outlier Detection with Loss Entropy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Huang, Yuang Zhang, Liping Wang, Fan Zhang, Xuemin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is an important data mining task. With the advance of deep learning, deep Outlier Detection (OD) has received broad interest. Most deep UOD models are trained exclusively on clean datasets to learn the distribution of the normal data, which requires huge manual efforts to clean the real-world data if possible. Instead of relying on clean datasets, some approaches directly train and detect on unlabeled contaminated datasets, leading to the need for methods that are robust to such conditions. Ensemble methods emerged as a superior solution to enhance model robustness against contaminated training sets. However, the training time is greatly increased by the ensemble.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of outliers on the training phase, aiming to halt training on unlabeled contaminated datasets before performance degradation. Initially, we noted that blending normal and anomalous data causes AUC fluctuations, a label-dependent measure of detection accuracy. To circumvent the need for labels, we propose a zero-label entropy metric named Loss Entropy for loss distribution, enabling us to infer optimal stopping points for training without labels. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate negative correlation between entropy metric and the label-based AUC. Based on this, we develop an automated early-stopping algorithm, EntropyStop, which halts training when loss entropy suggests the maximum model detection capability. We conduct extensive experiments on ADBench (including 47 real datasets), and the overall results indicate that AutoEncoder (AE) enhanced by our approach not only achieves better performance than ensemble AEs but also requires under 1\% of training time. Lastly, our proposed metric and early-stopping approach are evaluated on other deep OD models, exhibiting their broad potential applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoning Yu, Hongyang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lequan Lin, Dai Shi, Andi Han, Zhiyong Wang, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep-learning architectures designed for graph-type data, where understanding relationships among individual observations is crucial. However, achieving promising GNN performance, especially on unseen data, requires comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and meticulous training. Unfortunately, these processes come with high computational costs and significant human effort. Additionally, conventional searching algorithms such as grid search may result in overfitting on validation data, diminishing generalization accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a graph conditional latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs directly by learning from checkpoints saved during a light-tuning coarse search. Our method: (1) unleashes GNN training from heavy tuning and complex search space design; (2) produces GNN parameters that outperform those obtained through comprehensive grid search; and (3) establishes higher-quality generation for GNNs compared to diffusion frameworks designed for general neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengwei Yang, Ismat Jarin, Baturalp Buyukates, Salman Avestimehr, Athina Markopoulou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their private data. One key challenge in practical FL systems is data heterogeneity, particularly in handling clients with rare data, also referred to as Mavericks. These clients own one or more data classes exclusively, and the model performance becomes poor without their participation. Thus, utilizing Mavericks throughout training is crucial. In this paper, we first design a Maverick-aware Shapley valuation that fairly evaluates the contribution of Mavericks. The main idea is to compute the clients' Shapley values (SV) class-wise, i.e., per label. Next, we propose FedMS, a Maverick-Shapley client selection mechanism for FL that intelligently selects the clients that contribute the most in each round, by employing our Maverick-aware SV-based contribution score. We show that, compared to an extensive list of baselines, FedMS achieves better model performance and fairer Shapley Rewards distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongwei Yu, Jingqing Ruan, Dengpeng Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal dynamics models (CDMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing various challenges in reinforcement learning. To learn CDMs, recent studies have performed causal discovery to capture the causal dependencies among environmental variables. However, the learning of CDMs is still confined to small-scale environments due to computational complexity and sample efficiency constraints. This paper aims to extend CDMs to large-scale object-oriented environments, which consist of a multitude of objects classified into different categories. We introduce the Object-Oriented CDM (OOCDM) that shares causalities and parameters among objects belonging to the same class. Furthermore, we propose a learning method for OOCDM that enables it to adapt to a varying number of objects. Experiments on large-scale tasks indicate that OOCDM outperforms existing CDMs in terms of causal discovery, prediction accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihu Tang, Li Huang, Limin Wu, Xianghui Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Rough surface lubrication simulation is crucial for designing and optimizing tribological performance. Despite the growing application of Physical Information Neural Networks (PINNs) in hydrodynamic lubrication analysis, their use has been primarily limited to smooth surfaces. This is due to traditional PINN methods suffer from spectral bias, favoring to learn low-frequency features and thus failing to analyze rough surfaces with high-frequency signals. To date, no PINN methods have been reported for rough surface lubrication. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a novel multi-scale lubrication neural network architecture that utilizes a trainable Fourier feature network. By incorporating learnable feature embedding frequencies, this architecture automatically adapts to various frequency components, thereby enhancing the analysis of rough surface characteristics. This method has been tested across multiple surface morphologies, and the results have been compared with those obtained using the finite element method (FEM). The comparative analysis demonstrates that this approach achieves a high consistency with FEM results. Furthermore, this novel architecture surpasses traditional Fourier feature networks with fixed feature embedding frequencies in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Consequently, the multi-scale lubrication neural network model offers a more efficient tool for rough surface lubrication analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Azizmalayeri, Ameen Abu-Hanna, Giovanni Cin\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. OOD inputs are commonly expected to cause a more uncertain prediction in the primary task; however, there are OOD cases for which the model returns a highly confident prediction. This phenomenon, denoted as "overconfidence", presents a challenge to OOD detection. Specifically, theoretical evidence indicates that overconfidence is an intrinsic property of certain neural network architectures, leading to poor OOD detection. In this work, we address this issue by measuring extreme activation values in the penultimate layer of neural networks and then leverage this proxy of overconfidence to improve on several OOD detection baselines. We test our method on a wide array of experiments spanning synthetic data and real-world data, tabular and image datasets, multiple architectures such as ResNet and Transformer, different training loss functions, and include the scenarios examined in previous theoretical work. Compared to the baselines, our method often grants substantial improvements, with double-digit increases in OOD detection AUC, and it does not damage performance in any scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) serves as a vital rehabilitation initiative for older adults, aiming to enhance their strength and balance, and consequently prevent falls. While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems have been widely employed in recognizing the activities of individuals, existing systems focus on the duration of macro activities (i.e. a sequence of repetitions of the same exercise), neglecting the ability to discern micro activities (i.e. the individual repetitions of the exercises), in the case of OEP. This study presents a novel semi-supervised machine learning approach aimed at bridging this gap in recognizing the micro activities of OEP. To manage the limited dataset size, our model utilizes a Transformer encoder for feature extraction, subsequently classified by a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Simultaneously, the Transformer encoder is employed for masked unsupervised learning to reconstruct input signals. Results indicate that the masked unsupervised learning task enhances the performance of the supervised learning (classification task), as evidenced by f1-scores surpassing the clinically applicable threshold of 0.8. From the micro activities, two clinically relevant outcomes emerge: counting the number of repetitions of each exercise and calculating the velocity during chair rising. These outcomes enable the automatic monitoring of exercise intensity and difficulty in the daily lives of older adults.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzhou Lou, Junge Zhang, Jian Xie, Lifeng Liu, Dong Yan, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human preference alignment is critical in building powerful and reliable large language models (LLMs). However, current methods either ignore the multi-dimensionality of human preferences (e.g. helpfulness and harmlessness) or struggle with the complexity of managing multiple reward models. To address these issues, we propose Sequential Preference Optimization (SPO), a method that sequentially fine-tunes LLMs to align with multiple dimensions of human preferences. SPO avoids explicit reward modeling, directly optimizing the models to align with nuanced human preferences. We theoretically derive closed-form optimal SPO policy and loss function. Gradient analysis is conducted to show how SPO manages to fine-tune the LLMs while maintaining alignment on previously optimized dimensions. Empirical results on LLMs of different size and multiple evaluation datasets demonstrate that SPO successfully aligns LLMs across multiple dimensions of human preferences and significantly outperforms the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satvik Golechha</p>
<p>Abstract: Grokking, a phenomenon where machine learning models generalize long after overfitting, has been primarily observed and studied in algorithmic tasks. This paper explores grokking in real-world datasets using deep neural networks for classification under the cross-entropy loss. We challenge the prevalent hypothesis that the $L_2$ norm of weights is the primary cause of grokking by demonstrating that grokking can occur outside the expected range of weight norms. To better understand grokking, we introduce three new progress measures: activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, and approximate local circuit complexity. These measures are conceptually related to generalization and demonstrate a stronger correlation with grokking in real-world datasets compared to weight norms. Our findings suggest that while weight norms might usually correlate with grokking and our progress measures, they are not causative, and our proposed measures provide a better understanding of the dynamics of grokking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoya Yamasaki, Toshiyuki Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR) is classification of ordinal data in which the underlying categorical target variable has a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory variable. For $K$-class OR tasks, threshold methods learn a one-dimensional transformation (1DT) of the explanatory variable so that 1DT values for observations of the explanatory variable preserve the order of label values $1,\ldots,K$ for corresponding observations of the target variable well, and then assign a label prediction to the learned 1DT through threshold labeling, namely, according to the rank of an interval to which the 1DT belongs among intervals on the real line separated by $(K-1)$ threshold parameters. In this study, we propose a parallelizable algorithm to find the optimal threshold labeling, which was developed in previous research, and derive sufficient conditions for that algorithm to successfully output the optimal threshold labeling. In a numerical experiment we performed, the computation time taken for the whole learning process of a threshold method with the optimal threshold labeling could be reduced to approximately 60\,\% by using the proposed algorithm with parallel processing compared to using an existing algorithm based on dynamic programming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Makienko, Michael Grebshtein, Eli Gildish</p>
<p>Abstract: Vibrations of rotating machinery primarily originate from two sources, both of which are distorted by the machine's transfer function on their way to the sensor: the dominant gear-related vibrations and a low-energy signal linked to bearing faults. The proposed method facilitates the blind separation of vibration sources, eliminating the need for any information about the monitored equipment or external measurements. This method estimates both sources in two stages: initially, the gear signal is isolated using a dilated CNN, followed by the estimation of the bearing fault signal using the squared log envelope of the residual. The effect of the transfer function is removed from both sources using a novel whitening-based deconvolution method (WBD). Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to detect bearing failures early when no additional information is available. This study considers both local and distributed bearing faults, assuming that the vibrations are recorded under stable operating conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in machine learning and an abundance of structural monitoring data have inspired the integration of mechanical models with probabilistic models to identify a structure's state and quantify the uncertainty of its physical parameters and response. In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper , we introduce Wav-KAN, an innovative neural network architecture that leverages the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) framework to enhance interpretability and performance. Traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even recent advancements like Spl-KAN face challenges related to interpretability, training speed, robustness, computational efficiency, and performance. Wav-KAN addresses these limitations by incorporating wavelet functions into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network structure, enabling the network to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data efficiently. Wavelet-based approximations employ orthogonal or semi-orthogonal basis and also maintains a balance between accurately representing the underlying data structure and avoiding overfitting to the noise. Analogous to how water conforms to the shape of its container, Wav-KAN adapts to the data structure, resulting in enhanced accuracy, faster training speeds, and increased robustness compared to Spl-KAN and MLPs. Our results highlight the potential of Wav-KAN as a powerful tool for developing interpretable and high-performance neural networks, with applications spanning various fields. This work sets the stage for further exploration and implementation of Wav-KAN in frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and also it makes wavelet in KAN in wide-spread usage like nowadays activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid in universal approximation theory (UAT).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Wu, Zhichao Hou, Jirui Yuan, Yu Rong, Wenbing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to represent and simulate the dynamics of physical systems is a crucial yet challenging task. Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibylle Marcotte, R\'emi Gribonval, Gabriel Peyr\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Conservation laws are well-established in the context of Euclidean gradient flow dynamics, notably for linear or ReLU neural network training. Yet, their existence and principles for non-Euclidean geometries and momentum-based dynamics remain largely unknown. In this paper, we characterize "all" conservation laws in this general setting. In stark contrast to the case of gradient flows, we prove that the conservation laws for momentum-based dynamics exhibit temporal dependence. Additionally, we often observe a "conservation loss" when transitioning from gradient flow to momentum dynamics. Specifically, for linear networks, our framework allows us to identify all momentum conservation laws, which are less numerous than in the gradient flow case except in sufficiently over-parameterized regimes. With ReLU networks, no conservation law remains. This phenomenon also manifests in non-Euclidean metrics, used e.g. for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF): all conservation laws can be determined in the gradient flow context, yet none persists in the momentum case.</p>

Machine learning models are trained on these pre-processed datasets, and their predictions are expected to be fair. However, such approaches may exclude relevant data, making the attained subsets less trustworthy for further usage. To enhance the trustworthiness of prior methods, we propose additional requirements and objectives that the subsets must fulfill in addition to fairness: (1) group coverage, and (2) minimal data loss. While removing entire groups may improve the measured fairness, this practice is very problematic as failing to represent every group cannot be considered fair. In our second concern, we advocate for the retention of data while minimizing discrimination. By introducing a multi-objective optimization problem that considers fairness and data loss, we propose a methodology to find Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these objectives. By identifying such solutions, users can make informed decisions about the trade-off between fairness and data quality and select the most suitable subset for their application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Jin, Ishani Karmarkar, Aaron Sidford, Jiayi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide faster randomized algorithms for computing an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov decision process with $A_{\text{tot}}$-state-action pairs, bounded rewards, and discount factor $\gamma$. We provide an $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-2}])$-time algorithm in the sampling setting, where the probability transition matrix is unknown but accessible through a generative model which can be queried in $\tilde{O}(1)$-time, and an $\tilde{O}(s + (1-\gamma)^{-2})$-time algorithm in the offline setting where the probability transition matrix is known and $s$-sparse. These results improve upon the prior state-of-the-art which either ran in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-3}])$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Ye 2018] in the sampling setting, $\tilde{O}(s + A_{\text{tot}} (1-\gamma)^{-3})$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018] in the offline setting, or time at least quadratic in the number of states using interior point methods for linear programming. We achieve our results by building upon prior stochastic variance-reduced value iteration methods [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018]. We provide a variant that carefully truncates the progress of its iterates to improve the variance of new variance-reduced sampling procedures that we introduce to implement the steps. Our method is essentially model-free and can be implemented in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}})$-space when given generative model access. Consequently, our results take a step in closing the sample-complexity gap between model-free and model-based methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12954">A Method on Searching Better Activation Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Sun, Zihao Wu, Bo Xia, Pu Chang, Zibin Dong, Yifu Yuan, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) hinges greatly on the judicious selection of an activation function, introducing non-linearity into network and enabling them to model sophisticated relationships in data. However, the search of activation functions has largely relied on empirical knowledge in the past, lacking theoretical guidance, which has hindered the identification of more effective activation functions. In this work, we offer a proper solution to such issue. Firstly, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of the worst activation function with boundary conditions (WAFBC) from the perspective of information entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the Taylor expansion form of information entropy functional, we propose the Entropy-based Activation Function Optimization (EAFO) methodology. EAFO methodology presents a novel perspective for designing static activation functions in deep neural networks and the potential of dynamically optimizing activation during iterative training. Utilizing EAFO methodology, we derive a novel activation function from ReLU, known as Correction Regularized ReLU (CRReLU). Experiments conducted with vision transformer and its variants on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of CRReLU over existing corrections of ReLU. Extensive empirical studies on task of large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, CRReLU exhibits superior performance compared to GELU, suggesting its broader potential for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Diakonikolas, Vasilis Kontonis, Christos Tzamos, Nikos Zarifis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of online learning in the presence of Massart noise. Instead of assuming that the online adversary chooses an arbitrary sequence of labels, we assume that the context $\mathbf{x}$ is selected adversarially but the label $y$ presented to the learner disagrees with the ground-truth label of $\mathbf{x}$ with unknown probability at most $\eta$. We study the fundamental class of $\gamma$-margin linear classifiers and present a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves mistake bound $\eta T + o(T)$. Our mistake bound is qualitatively tight for efficient algorithms: it is known that even in the offline setting achieving classification error better than $\eta$ requires super-polynomial time in the SQ model.
  We extend our online learning model to a $k$-arm contextual bandit setting where the rewards -- instead of satisfying commonly used realizability assumptions -- are consistent (in expectation) with some linear ranking function with weight vector $\mathbf{w}^\ast$. Given a list of contexts $\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots \mathbf{x}_k$, if $\mathbf{w}^*\cdot \mathbf{x}_i > \mathbf{w}^* \cdot \mathbf{x}_j$, the expected reward of action $i$ must be larger than that of $j$ by at least $\Delta$. We use our Massart online learner to design an efficient bandit algorithm that obtains expected reward at least $(1-1/k)~ \Delta T - o(T)$ bigger than choosing a random action at every round.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961">Energy Rank Alignment: Using Preference Optimization to Search Chemical Space at Scale</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriram Chennakesavalu, Frank Hu, Sebastian Ibarraran, Grant M. Rotskoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers to generate molecules with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space. While our focus here is on chemical search, we also obtain excellent results on an AI supervised task for LLM alignment, showing that the method is scalable and general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Zheng, Zhongyi Han, Yilong Yin, Xin Gao, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Noisy labels significantly hinder the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, particularly due to ambiguous instance features. Traditional techniques that attempt to correct noisy labels directly, such as those using transition matrices, often fail to address the inherent complexities of the problem sufficiently. In this paper, we introduce EchoAlign, a transformative paradigm shift in learning from noisy labels. Instead of focusing on label correction, EchoAlign treats noisy labels ($\tilde{Y}$) as accurate and modifies corresponding instance features ($X$) to achieve better alignment with $\tilde{Y}$. EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels. (2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets. EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts. It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection. This integrated approach yields remarkable results. In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method. Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Brandon, Mayank Mishra, Aniruddha Nrusimha, Rameswar Panda, Jonathan Ragan Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching plays an essential role in accelerating decoding for transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, the amount of memory required to store the KV cache can become prohibitive at long sequence lengths and large batch sizes. Since the invention of the transformer, two of the most effective interventions discovered for reducing the size of the KV cache have been Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and its generalization, Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). MQA and GQA both modify the design of the attention block so that multiple query heads can share a single key/value head, reducing the number of distinct key/value heads by a large factor while only minimally degrading accuracy. In this paper, we show that it is possible to take Multi-Query Attention a step further by also sharing key and value heads between adjacent layers, yielding a new attention design we call Cross-Layer Attention (CLA). With CLA, we find that it is possible to reduce the size of the KV cache by another 2x while maintaining nearly the same accuracy as unmodified MQA. In experiments training 1B- and 3B-parameter models from scratch, we demonstrate that CLA provides a Pareto improvement over the memory/accuracy tradeoffs which are possible with traditional MQA, enabling inference with longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes than would otherwise be possible</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> F. J. Alcaide, I. A. Illan, J. Ramirez, J. M. Gorriz</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in communication, social interaction and restricted or repetitive behaviors. Extensive research has been conducted to identify distinctions between individuals with ASC and neurotypical individuals. However, limited attention has been given to comprehensively evaluating how variations in image acquisition protocols across different centers influence these observed differences. This analysis focuses on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I) database, evaluating subjects' condition and individual centers to identify disparities between ASC and control groups. Statistical analysis, employing permutation tests, utilizes two distinct statistical mapping methods: Statistical Agnostic Mapping (SAM) and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Results reveal the absence of statistically significant differences in any brain region, attributed to factors such as limited sample sizes within certain centers, noise effects and the problem of multicentrism in a heterogeneous condition such as autism. This study indicates limitations in using the ABIDE I database to detect structural differences in the brain between neurotypical individuals and those diagnosed with ASC. Furthermore, results from the SAM mapping method show greater consistency with existing literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eshant English, Nicola Paoletti</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are notorious for providing point predictions but not prediction intervals. There are many applications where one requires confidence in predictions and prediction intervals. Stringing together, these intervals give rise to joint prediction regions with the desired significance level. It is an easy task to compute Joint Prediction regions (JPR) when the data is IID. However, the task becomes overly difficult when JPR is needed for time series because of the dependence between the observations. This project aims to implement Wolf and Wunderli's method for constructing JPRs and compare it with other methods (e.g. NP heuristic, Joint Marginals). The method under study is based on bootstrapping and is applied to different datasets (Min Temp, Sunspots), using different predictors (e.g. ARIMA and LSTM). One challenge of applying the method under study is to derive prediction standard errors for models, it cannot be obtained analytically. A novel method to estimate prediction standard error for different predictors is also devised. Finally, the method is applied to a synthetic dataset to find empirical averages and empirical widths and the results from the Wolf and Wunderli paper are consolidated. The experimental results show a narrowing of width with strong predictors like neural nets, widening of width with increasing forecast horizon H and decreasing significance level alpha, controlling the width with parameter k in K-FWE, and loss of information using Joint Marginals.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12236">Fully Distributed Fog Load Balancing with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maad Ebrahim, Abdelhakim Hafid</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications require real-time support to handle the ever-growing demand for computing resources to process IoT workloads. Fog Computing provides high availability of such resources in a distributed manner. However, these resources must be efficiently managed to distribute unpredictable traffic demands among heterogeneous Fog resources. This paper proposes a fully distributed load-balancing solution with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that intelligently distributes IoT workloads to optimize the waiting time while providing fair resource utilization in the Fog network. These agents use transfer learning for life-long self-adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment. By leveraging distributed decision-making, MARL agents effectively minimize the waiting time compared to a single centralized agent solution and other baselines, enhancing end-to-end execution delay. Besides performance gain, a fully distributed solution allows for a global-scale implementation where agents can work independently in small collaboration regions, leveraging nearby local resources. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of a realistic frequency to observe the state of the environment, unlike the unrealistic common assumption in the literature of having observations readily available in real-time for every required action. The findings highlight the trade-off between realism and performance using an interval-based Gossip-based multi-casting protocol against assuming real-time observation availability for every generated workload.</p>

We further develop methods to examine the causes to go-around occurrences both from a global view and an individual flight perspective. According to our results, in-trail spacing, and simultaneous runway operation appear to be the top factors that contribute to overall go-around occurrences. We then integrate these pre-trained models and analyses with real-time data streaming, and finally develop a demo web-based user interface that integrates the different components designed previously into a real-time tool that can eventually be used by flight crews and other line personnel to identify situations in which there is a high risk of a go-around.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI and achieved breakthrough performance on a wide range of tasks that require human intelligence. In science, perhaps the most interesting application of LLMs is for hypothesis formation. A feature of LLMs, which results from their probabilistic structure, is that the output text is not necessarily a valid inference from the training text. These are 'hallucinations', and are a serious problem in many applications. However, in science, hallucinations may be useful: they are novel hypotheses whose validity may be tested by laboratory experiments. Here we experimentally test the use of LLMs as a source of scientific hypotheses using the domain of breast cancer treatment. We applied the LLM GPT4 to hypothesize novel pairs of FDA-approved non-cancer drugs that target the MCF7 breast cancer cell line relative to the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A. In the first round of laboratory experiments GPT4 succeeded in discovering three drug combinations (out of 12 tested) with synergy scores above the positive controls. These combinations were itraconazole + atenolol, disulfiram + simvastatin and dipyridamole + mebendazole. GPT4 was then asked to generate new combinations after considering its initial results. It then discovered three more combinations with positive synergy scores (out of four tested), these were disulfiram + fulvestrant, mebendazole + quinacrine and disulfiram + quinacrine. A limitation of GPT4 as a generator of hypotheses was that its explanations for them were formulaic and unconvincing. We conclude that LLMs are an exciting novel source of scientific hypotheses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial Training is a proven defense strategy against adversarial malware. However, generating adversarial malware samples for this type of training presents a challenge because the resulting adversarial malware needs to remain evasive and functional. This work proposes an attack framework, EGAN, to address this limitation. EGAN leverages an Evolution Strategy and Generative Adversarial Network to select a sequence of attack actions that can mutate a Ransomware file while preserving its original functionality. We tested this framework on popular AI-powered commercial antivirus systems listed on VirusTotal and demonstrated that our framework is capable of bypassing the majority of these systems. Moreover, we evaluated whether the EGAN attack framework can evade other commercial non-AI antivirus solutions. Our results indicate that the adversarial ransomware generated can increase the probability of evading some of them.</p>

Here we build a Python interface library that enables controlling an SPM from either a local computer or a remote high-performance computer (HPC), which satisfies the high computation power need of machine learning algorithms in autonomous workflows. We further introduce a general platform to abstract the operations of SPM in scientific discovery into fixed-policy or reward-driven workflows. Our work provides a full infrastructure to build automated SPM workflows for both routine operations and autonomous scientific discovery with machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiucai Ding, Rong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrative analysis of multiple heterogeneous datasets has become standard practice in many research fields, especially in single-cell genomics and medical informatics. Existing approaches oftentimes suffer from limited power in capturing nonlinear structures, insufficient account of noisiness and effects of high-dimensionality, lack of adaptivity to signals and sample sizes imbalance, and their results are sometimes difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a novel kernel spectral method that achieves joint embeddings of two independently observed high-dimensional noisy datasets. The proposed method automatically captures and leverages possibly shared low-dimensional structures across datasets to enhance embedding quality. The obtained low-dimensional embeddings can be utilized for many downstream tasks such as simultaneous clustering, data visualization, and denoising. The proposed method is justified by rigorous theoretical analysis. Specifically, we show the consistency of our method in recovering the low-dimensional noiseless signals, and characterize the effects of the signal-to-noise ratios on the rates of convergence. Under a joint manifolds model framework, we establish the convergence of ultimate embeddings to the eigenfunctions of some newly introduced integral operators. These operators, referred to as duo-landmark integral operators, are defined by the convolutional kernel maps of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). These RKHSs capture the either partially or entirely shared underlying low-dimensional nonlinear signal structures of the two datasets. Our numerical experiments and analyses of two single-cell omics datasets demonstrate the empirical advantages of the proposed method over existing methods in both embeddings and several downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyan Wang, Cheenar Banerjee, Samer Chucri, Fabio Soldo, Sriraj Badam, Ed H. Chi, Minmin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: It has become increasingly clear that recommender systems overly focusing on short-term engagement can inadvertently hurt long-term user experience. However, it is challenging to optimize long-term user experience directly as the desired signal is sparse, noisy and manifests over a long horizon. In this work, we show the benefits of incorporating higher-level user understanding, specifically user intents that can persist across multiple interactions or recommendation sessions, for whole-page recommendation toward optimizing long-term user experience. User intent has primarily been investigated within the context of search, but remains largely under-explored for recommender systems. To bridge this gap, we develop a probabilistic intent-based whole-page diversification framework in the final stage of a recommender system. Starting with a prior belief of user intents, the proposed diversification framework sequentially selects items at each position based on these beliefs, and subsequently updates posterior beliefs about the intents. It ensures that different user intents are represented in a page towards optimizing long-term user experience.
  We experiment with the intent diversification framework on one of the world's largest content recommendation platforms, serving billions of users daily. Our framework incorporates the user's exploration intent, capturing their propensity to explore new interests and content. Live experiments show that the proposed framework leads to an increase in user retention and overall user enjoyment, validating its effectiveness in facilitating long-term planning. In particular, it enables users to consistently discover and engage with diverse contents that align with their underlying intents over time, thereby leading to an improved long-term user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael K\"olle, Timo Witter, Tobias Rohe, Gerhard Stenzel, Philipp Altmann, Thomas Gabor</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Computing aims to streamline machine learning, making it more effective with fewer trainable parameters. This reduction of parameters can speed up the learning process and reduce the use of computational resources. However, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a limited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these challenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). VQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted through parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These circuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have presented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing promising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the effects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output scaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum proximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in the popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their ability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing effectiveness. Our findings indicate that data re-uploading and an exponential learning rate decay significantly enhance hyperparameter stability and overall performance. While input scaling does not improve parameter efficiency, output scaling effectively manages greediness, leading to increased learning speed and robustness.</p>

We also propose practical criteria for AIGLE to enforce long-term dynamical consistency. Case studies of a toy polymer, with 20 coarse-grained sites, and the alanine dipeptide, with two dihedral angles, elucidate why one should adopt AIGLE or its Markovian limit for modeling coarse-grained conformational dynamics in practice.</p>

In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Huang, Amy Aumpansub</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be a promising tool in detecting software vulnerabilities. In this work, we train neural networks with program slices extracted from the source code of C/C++ programs to detect software vulnerabilities. The program slices capture the syntax and semantic characteristics of vulnerability-related program constructs, including API function call, array usage, pointer usage, and arithmetic expression. To achieve a strong prediction model for both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code, we compare different types of training data, different optimizers, and different types of neural networks. Our result shows that combining different types of characteristics of source code and using a balanced number of vulnerable program slices and non-vulnerable program slices produce a balanced accuracy in predicting both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code. Among different neural networks, BGRU with the ADAM optimizer performs the best in detecting software vulnerabilities with an accuracy of 92.49%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sisi Shao, Junhyung Park, Weng Kee Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: General purpose optimization routines such as nlminb, optim (R) or nlmixed (SAS) are frequently used to estimate model parameters in nonstandard distributions. This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), as an alternative to many of the current algorithms used in statistics. We find that PSO can not only reproduce the same results as the above routines, it can also produce results that are more optimal or when others cannot converge. In the latter case, it can also identify the source of the problem or problems. We highlight advantages of using PSO using four examples, where: (1) some parameters in a generalized distribution are unidentified using PSO when it is not apparent or computationally manifested using routines in R or SAS; (2) PSO can produce estimation results for the log-binomial regressions when current routines may not; (3) PSO provides flexibility in the link function for binomial regression with LASSO penalty, which is unsupported by standard packages like GLM and GENMOD in Stata and SAS, respectively, and (4) PSO provides superior MLE estimates for an EE-IW distribution compared with those from the traditional statistical methods that rely on moments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a pioneering approach to self-supervised learning for point clouds, employing a geometrically informed mask selection strategy called GeoMask3D (GM3D) to boost the efficiency of Masked Auto Encoders (MAE). Unlike the conventional method of random masking, our technique utilizes a teacher-student model to focus on intricate areas within the data, guiding the model's focus toward regions with higher geometric complexity. This strategy is grounded in the hypothesis that concentrating on harder patches yields a more robust feature representation, as evidenced by the improved performance on downstream tasks. Our method also presents a complete-to-partial feature-level knowledge distillation technique designed to guide the prediction of geometric complexity utilizing a comprehensive context from feature-level information. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superiority over State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating marked improvements in classification, and few-shot tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Shi, Chong Zhang, Takahiro Miki, Joonho Lee, Marco Hutter, Stelian Coros</p>
<p>Abstract: Legged locomotion has recently achieved remarkable success with the progress of machine learning techniques, especially deep reinforcement learning (RL). Controllers employing neural networks have demonstrated empirical and qualitative robustness against real-world uncertainties, including sensor noise and external perturbations. However, formally investigating the vulnerabilities of these locomotion controllers remains a challenge. This difficulty arises from the requirement to pinpoint vulnerabilities across a long-tailed distribution within a high-dimensional, temporally sequential space. As a first step towards quantitative verification, we propose a computational method that leverages sequential adversarial attacks to identify weaknesses in learned locomotion controllers. Our research demonstrates that, even state-of-the-art robust controllers can fail significantly under well-designed, low-magnitude adversarial sequence. Through experiments in simulation and on the real robot, we validate our approach's effectiveness, and we illustrate how the results it generates can be used to robustify the original policy and offer valuable insights into the safety of these black-box policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Hadizadeh, S. Faegheh Yeganli, Bahador Rashidi, Ivan V. Baji\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in applications of multimodal signal processing and analysis, largely driven by the increased availability of multimodal datasets and the rapid progress in multimodal learning systems. Well-known examples include autonomous vehicles, audiovisual generative systems, vision-language systems, and so on. Such systems integrate multiple signal modalities: text, speech, images, video, LiDAR, etc., to perform various tasks. A key issue for understanding such systems is the relationship between various modalities and how it impacts task performance. In this paper, we employ the concept of mutual information (MI) to gain insight into this issue. Taking advantage of the recent progress in entropy modeling and estimation, we develop a system called InfoMeter to estimate MI between modalities in a multimodal learning system. We then apply InfoMeter to analyze a multimodal 3D object detection system over a large-scale dataset for autonomous driving. Our experiments on this system suggest that a lower MI between modalities is beneficial for detection accuracy. This new insight may facilitate improvements in the development of future multimodal learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charles O'Neill, Thang Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient and robust method for discovering interpretable circuits in large language models using discrete sparse autoencoders. Our approach addresses key limitations of existing techniques, namely computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. We propose training sparse autoencoders on carefully designed positive and negative examples, where the model can only correctly predict the next token for the positive examples. We hypothesise that learned representations of attention head outputs will signal when a head is engaged in specific computations. By discretising the learned representations into integer codes and measuring the overlap between codes unique to positive examples for each head, we enable direct identification of attention heads involved in circuits without the need for expensive ablations or architectural modifications. On three well-studied tasks - indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion - the proposed method achieves higher precision and recall in recovering ground-truth circuits compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while reducing runtime from hours to seconds. Notably, we require only 5-10 text examples for each task to learn robust representations. Our findings highlight the promise of discrete sparse autoencoders for scalable and efficient mechanistic interpretability, offering a new direction for analysing the inner workings of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Textual image generation spans diverse fields like advertising, education, product packaging, social media, information visualization, and branding. Despite recent strides in language-guided image synthesis using diffusion models, current models excel in image generation but struggle with accurate text rendering and offer limited control over font attributes. In this paper, we aim to enhance the synthesis of high-quality images with precise text customization, thereby contributing to the advancement of image generation models. We call our proposed method CustomText. Our implementation leverages a pre-trained TextDiffuser model to enable control over font color, background, and types. Additionally, to address the challenge of accurately rendering small-sized fonts, we train the ControlNet model for a consistency decoder, significantly enhancing text-generation performance. We assess the performance of CustomText in comparison to previous methods of textual image generation on the publicly available CTW-1500 dataset and a self-curated dataset for small-text generation, showcasing superior results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Holger Dette, Carina Graw</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a widely used tool in machine learning. In the context of Differential Privacy (DP), SGD has been well studied in the last years in which the focus is mainly on convergence rates and privacy guarantees. While in the non private case, uncertainty quantification (UQ) for SGD by bootstrap has been addressed by several authors, these procedures cannot be transferred to differential privacy due to multiple queries to the private data. In this paper, we propose a novel block bootstrap for SGD under local differential privacy that is computationally tractable and does not require an adjustment of the privacy budget. The method can be easily implemented and is applicable to a broad class of estimation problems. We prove the validity of our approach and illustrate its finite sample properties by means of a simulation study. As a by-product, the new method also provides a simple alternative numerical tool for UQ for non-private SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Steckel, Wouter Jansen, Nico Huebel</p>
<p>Abstract: The predictive brain hypothesis suggests that perception can be interpreted as the process of minimizing the error between predicted perception tokens generated by an internal world model and actual sensory input tokens. When implementing working examples of this hypothesis in the context of in-air sonar, significant difficulties arise due to the sparse nature of the reflection model that governs ultrasonic sensing. Despite these challenges, creating consistent world models using sonar data is crucial for implementing predictive processing of ultrasound data in robotics. In an effort to enable robust robot behavior using ultrasound as the sole exteroceptive sensor modality, this paper introduces EchoPT, a pretrained transformer architecture designed to predict 2D sonar images from previous sensory data and robot ego-motion information. We detail the transformer architecture that drives EchoPT and compare the performance of our model to several state-of-the-art techniques. In addition to presenting and evaluating our EchoPT model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this predictive perception approach in two robotic tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in pre-trained large foundation models (LFM) have yielded significant breakthroughs across various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. These models have been particularly impactful in the domain of medical diagnostic tasks. With abundant unlabeled data, an LFM has been developed for fundus images using the Vision Transformer (VIT) and a self-supervised learning framework. This LFM has shown promising performance in fundus disease diagnosis across multiple datasets. On the other hand, deep learning models have long been challenged by dataset quality issues, such as image quality and dataset bias. To investigate the influence of data quality on LFM, we conducted explorations in two fundus diagnosis tasks using datasets of varying quality. Specifically, we explored the following questions: Is LFM more robust to image quality? Is LFM affected by dataset bias? Can fine-tuning techniques alleviate these effects? Our investigation found that LFM exhibits greater resilience to dataset quality issues, including image quality and dataset bias, compared to typical convolutional networks. Furthermore, we discovered that overall fine-tuning is an effective adapter for LFM to mitigate the impact of dataset quality issues.</p>

To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that transforms the deep estimation paradigm into a platform conducive to conditional mean estimation, leveraging the conditional diffusion model. Theoretically, we develop an end-to-end convergence rate for the conditional diffusion model and establish the asymptotic normality of the generated samples. Consequently, we are equipped to construct confidence regions, facilitating robust statistical inference.

<p>Abstract: This work addresses the need for a balanced approach between performance and efficiency in scalable production environments for visually-rich document understanding (VDU) tasks. Currently, there is a reliance on large document foundation models that offer advanced capabilities but come with a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a multimodal early exit (EE) model design that incorporates various training strategies, exit layer types and placements. Our goal is to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between predictive performance and efficiency for multimodal document image classification. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we compare our approach with traditional exit policies and showcase an improved performance-efficiency trade-off. Our multimodal EE design preserves the model's predictive capabilities, enhancing both speed and latency. This is achieved through a reduction of over 20% in latency, while fully retaining the baseline accuracy. This research represents the first exploration of multimodal EE design within the VDU community, highlighting as well the effectiveness of calibration in improving confidence scores for exiting at different layers. Overall, our findings contribute to practical VDU applications by enhancing both performance and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training has emerged as a transformative paradigm, displaying remarkable advancements in various domains. However, the susceptibility to domain shift, where pre-training data distribution differs from fine-tuning, poses a significant obstacle. To address this, we augment the Swin Transformer to learn from different medical imaging modalities, enhancing downstream performance. Our model, dubbed SwinFUSE (Swin Multi-Modal Fusion for UnSupervised Enhancement), offers three key advantages: (i) it learns from both Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) during pre-training, resulting in complementary feature representations; (ii) a domain-invariance module (DIM) that effectively highlights salient input regions, enhancing adaptability; (iii) exhibits remarkable generalizability, surpassing the confines of tasks it was initially pre-trained on. Our experiments on two publicly available 3D segmentation datasets show a modest 1-2% performance trade-off compared to single-modality models, yet significant out-performance of up to 27% on out-of-distribution modality. This substantial improvement underscores our proposed approach's practical relevance and real-world applicability. Code is available at: https://github.com/devalab/SwinFUSE</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we bridge Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [17] and kernel density estimations (KDEs) [25 ],[23] by approximating the posterior by KDEs and deriving an upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The flexibility of KDEs makes the optimization of posteriors in VAEs possible, which not only addresses the limitations of Gaussian latent space in vanilla VAE but also provides a new perspective of estimating the KL-divergence in ELBO. Under appropriate conditions [ 9],[3 ], we show that the Epanechnikov kernel is the optimal choice in minimizing the derived upper bound of KL-divergence asymptotically. Compared with Gaussian kernel, Epanechnikov kernel has compact support which should make the generated sample less noisy and blurry. The implementation of Epanechnikov kernel in ELBO is straightforward as it lies in the "location-scale" family of distributions where the reparametrization tricks can be directly employed. A series of experiments on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA further demonstrate the superiority of Epanechnikov Variational Autoenocoder (EVAE) over vanilla VAE in the quality of reconstructed images, as measured by the FID score and Sharpness[27].</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional search and rescue methods in wilderness areas can be time-consuming and have limited coverage. Drones offer a faster and more flexible solution, but optimizing their search paths is crucial. This paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to create efficient search missions for drones in wilderness environments. Our approach leverages a priori data about the search area and the missing person in the form of a probability distribution map. This allows the deep reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal flight paths that maximize the probability of finding the missing person quickly. Experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement in search times compared to traditional coverage planning and search planning algorithms. In one comparison, deep reinforcement learning is found to outperform other algorithms by over $160\%$, a difference that can mean life or death in real-world search operations. Additionally, unlike previous work, our approach incorporates a continuous action space enabled by cubature, allowing for more nuanced flight patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonghyun Song, Cheyon Jin, Wenlong Zhao, Jay-Yoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a scalable bi-encoder, followed by expensive but more accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set. However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline. To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers. While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100. Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy. Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever. This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).} Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking. The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than cross-encoders but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Zeng, Daniel E. Acuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining funding is an important part of becoming a successful scientist. Junior faculty spend a great deal of time finding the right agencies and programs that best match their research profile. But what are the factors that influence the best publication--grant matching? Some universities might employ pre-award personnel to understand these factors, but not all institutions can afford to hire them. Historical records of publications funded by grants can help us understand the matching process and also help us develop recommendation systems to automate it. In this work, we present \textsc{GotFunding} (Grant recOmmendaTion based on past FUNDING), a recommendation system trained on National Institutes of Health's (NIH) grant--publication records. Our system achieves a high performance (NDCG@1 = 0.945) by casting the problem as learning to rank. By analyzing the features that make predictions effective, our results show that the ranking considers most important 1) the year difference between publication and grant grant, 2) the amount of information provided in the publication, and 3) the relevance of the publication to the grant. We discuss future improvements of the system and an online tool for scientists to try.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaojian Yu, Yinghao Wu, Zhuotao Deng, Yansong Tang, Xiao-Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large-scale auto-regressive models have made significant progress in various tasks, such as text or video generation. However, the environmental impact of these models has been largely overlooked, with a lack of assessment and analysis of their carbon footprint. To address this gap, we introduce OpenCarbonEval, a unified framework for integrating large-scale models across diverse modalities to predict carbon emissions, which could provide AI service providers and users with a means to estimate emissions beforehand and help mitigate the environmental pressure associated with these models. In OpenCarbonEval, we propose a dynamic throughput modeling approach that could capture workload and hardware fluctuations in the training process for more precise emissions estimates. Our evaluation results demonstrate that OpenCarbonEval can more accurately predict training emissions than previous methods, and can be seamlessly applied to different modal tasks. Specifically, we show that OpenCarbonEval achieves superior performance in predicting carbon emissions for both visual models and language models. By promoting sustainable AI development and deployment, OpenCarbonEval can help reduce the environmental impact of large-scale models and contribute to a more environmentally responsible future for the AI community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Yang Tseng, Tzu-Ling Lin, Hong-Han Shuai, Jen-Wei Huang, Wen-Whei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, humans are constantly exposed to music, whether through voluntary streaming services or incidental encounters during commercial breaks. Despite the abundance of music, certain pieces remain more memorable and often gain greater popularity. Inspired by this phenomenon, we focus on measuring and predicting music memorability. To achieve this, we collect a new music piece dataset with reliable memorability labels using a novel interactive experimental procedure. We then train baselines to predict and analyze music memorability, leveraging both interpretable features and audio mel-spectrograms as inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore music memorability using data-driven deep learning-based methods. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that while there is room for improvement, predicting music memorability with limited data is possible. Certain intrinsic elements, such as higher valence, arousal, and faster tempo, contribute to memorable music. As prediction techniques continue to evolve, real-life applications like music recommendation systems and music style transfer will undoubtedly benefit from this new area of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Requeima, John Bronskill, Dami Choi, Richard E. Turner, David Duvenaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning practitioners often face significant challenges in formally integrating their prior knowledge and beliefs into predictive models, limiting the potential for nuanced and context-aware analyses. Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuang Zhao, Zhaocheng Du, Qinglin Jia, Linxuan Zhang, Zhenhua Dong, Ruiming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increase in the business scale and number of domains in online advertising, multi-domain ad recommendation has become a mainstream solution in the industry. The core of multi-domain recommendation is effectively modeling the commonalities and distinctions among domains. Existing works are dedicated to designing model architectures for implicit multi-domain modeling while overlooking an in-depth investigation from a more fundamental perspective of feature distributions. This paper focuses on features with significant differences across various domains in both distributions and effects on model predictions. We refer to these features as domain-sensitive features, which serve as carriers of domain distinctions and are crucial for multi-domain modeling. Experiments demonstrate that existing multi-domain modeling methods may neglect domain-sensitive features, indicating insufficient learning of domain distinctions. To avoid this neglect, we propose a domain-sensitive feature attribution method to identify features that best reflect domain distinctions from the feature set. Further, we design a memory architecture that extracts domain-specific information from domain-sensitive features for the model to retrieve and integrate, thereby enhancing the awareness of domain distinctions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in capturing domain distinctions and improving multi-domain recommendation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weicai Li, Tiejun Lv, Wei Ni, Jingbo Zhao, Ekram Hossain, H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of imperfect communication channels on decentralized federated learning (D-FL) and subsequently determines the optimal number of local aggregations per training round, adapting to the network topology and imperfect channels. We start by deriving the bias of locally aggregated D-FL models under imperfect channels from the ideal global models requiring perfect channels and aggregations. The bias reveals that excessive local aggregations can accumulate communication errors and degrade convergence. Another important aspect is that we analyze a convergence upper bound of D-FL based on the bias. By minimizing the bound, the optimal number of local aggregations is identified to balance a trade-off with accumulation of communication errors in the absence of knowledge of the channels. With this knowledge, the impact of communication errors can be alleviated, allowing the convergence upper bound to decrease throughout aggregations. Experiments validate our convergence analysis and also identify the optimal number of local aggregations on two widely considered image classification tasks. It is seen that D-FL, with an optimal number of local aggregations, can outperform its potential alternatives by over 10% in training accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Holli Sargeant, Ahmed Izzidien, Felix Steffek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and applying a novel taxonomy for topic modelling summary judgment cases in the United Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of 87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andres Hernandez, Zhongqi Miao, Luisa Vargas, Rahul Dodhia, Juan Lavista</p>
<p>Abstract: The alarming decline in global biodiversity, driven by various factors, underscores the urgent need for large-scale wildlife monitoring. In response, scientists have turned to automated deep learning methods for data processing in wildlife monitoring. However, applying these advanced methods in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their complexity and the need for specialized knowledge, primarily because of technical challenges and interdisciplinary barriers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Pytorch-Wildlife, an open-source deep learning platform built on PyTorch. It is designed for creating, modifying, and sharing powerful AI models. This platform emphasizes usability and accessibility, making it accessible to individuals with limited or no technical background. It also offers a modular codebase to simplify feature expansion and further development. Pytorch-Wildlife offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface, accessible through local installation or Hugging Face, for animal detection and classification in images and videos. As two real-world applications, Pytorch-Wildlife has been utilized to train animal classification models for species recognition in the Amazon Rainforest and for invasive opossum recognition in the Galapagos Islands. The Opossum model achieves 98% accuracy, and the Amazon model has 92% recognition accuracy for 36 animals in 90% of the data. As Pytorch-Wildlife evolves, we aim to integrate more conservation tasks, addressing various environmental challenges. Pytorch-Wildlife is available at https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as summarization, arithmetic reasoning, and question answering. However, they encounter significant challenges in the domain of moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, especially in complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders. This paper introduces the Skin-in-the-Game (SKIG) framework, aimed at enhancing moral reasoning in LLMs by exploring decisions' consequences from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Central to SKIG's mechanism is simulating accountability for actions, which, alongside empathy exercises and risk assessment, is pivotal to its effectiveness. We validate SKIG's performance across various moral reasoning benchmarks with proprietary and opensource LLMs, and investigate its crucial components through extensive ablation analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir R. Kostic, Karim Lounici, Helene Halconruy, Timothee Devergne, Massimiliano Pontil</p>
<p>Abstract: We address data-driven learning of the infinitesimal generator of stochastic diffusion processes, essential for understanding numerical simulations of natural and physical systems. The unbounded nature of the generator poses significant challenges, rendering conventional analysis techniques for Hilbert-Schmidt operators ineffective. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework based on the energy functional for these stochastic processes. Our approach integrates physical priors through an energy-based risk metric in both full and partial knowledge settings. We evaluate the statistical performance of a reduced-rank estimator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) in the partial knowledge setting. Notably, our approach provides learning bounds independent of the state space dimension and ensures non-spurious spectral estimation. Additionally, we elucidate how the distortion between the intrinsic energy-induced metric of the stochastic diffusion and the RKHS metric used for generator estimation impacts the spectral learning bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wengxi Li, Roy Pea, Nick Haber, Hari Subramonyam</p>
<p>Abstract: Online programming videos, including tutorials and streamcasts, are widely popular and contain a wealth of expert knowledge. However, effectively utilizing these resources to achieve targeted learning goals can be challenging. Unlike direct tutoring, video content lacks tailored guidance based on individual learning paces, personalized feedback, and interactive engagement necessary for support and monitoring. Our work transforms programming videos into one-on-one tutoring experiences using the cognitive apprenticeship framework. Tutorly, developed as a JupyterLab Plugin, allows learners to (1) set personalized learning goals, (2) engage in learning-by-doing through a conversational LLM-based mentor agent, (3) receive guidance and feedback based on a student model that steers the mentor moves. In a within-subject study with 16 participants learning exploratory data analysis from a streamcast, Tutorly significantly improved their performance from 61.9% to 76.6% based on a post-test questionnaire. Tutorly demonstrates the potential for enhancing programming video learning experiences with LLM and learner modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rudolf Herdt, Louisa Kinzel, Johann Georg Maa{\ss}, Marvin Walther, Henning Fr\"ohlich, Tim Schubert, Peter Maass, Christian Patrick Schaaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Rodents employ a broad spectrum of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) for social communication. As these vocalizations offer valuable insights into affective states, social interactions, and developmental stages of animals, various deep learning approaches have aimed to automate both the quantitative (detection) and qualitative (classification) analysis of USVs. Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of different types of neural networks for USV classification. We assessed various feedforward networks, including a custom-built, fully-connected network and convolutional neural network, different residual neural networks (ResNets), an EfficientNet, and a Vision Transformer (ViT). Paired with a refined, entropy-based detection algorithm (achieving recall of 94.9% and precision of 99.3%), the best architecture (achieving 86.79% accuracy) was integrated into a fully automated pipeline capable of analyzing extensive USV datasets with high reliability. Additionally, users can specify an individual minimum accuracy threshold based on their research needs. In this semi-automated setup, the pipeline selectively classifies calls with high pseudo-probability, leaving the rest for manual inspection. Our study focuses exclusively on neonatal USVs. As part of an ongoing phenotyping study, our pipeline has proven to be a valuable tool for identifying key differences in USVs produced by mice with autism-like behaviors.</p>

Gaipl, Sabine Semrau, Christoph Bert, Rainer Fietkau, Florian Putz</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: This research aims to improve glioblastoma survival prediction by integrating MR images, clinical and molecular-pathologic data in a transformer-based deep learning model, addressing data heterogeneity and performance generalizability. Method: We propose and evaluate a transformer-based non-linear and non-proportional survival prediction model. The model employs self-supervised learning techniques to effectively encode the high-dimensional MRI input for integration with non-imaging data using cross-attention. To demonstrate model generalizability, the model is assessed with the time-dependent concordance index (Cdt) in two training setups using three independent public test sets: UPenn-GBM, UCSF-PDGM, and RHUH-GBM, each comprising 378, 366, and 36 cases, respectively. Results: The proposed transformer model achieved promising performance for imaging as well as non-imaging data, effectively integrating both modalities for enhanced performance (UPenn-GBM test-set, imaging Cdt 0.645, multimodal Cdt 0.707) while outperforming state-of-the-art late-fusion 3D-CNN-based models. Consistent performance was observed across the three independent multicenter test sets with Cdt values of 0.707 (UPenn-GBM, internal test set), 0.672 (UCSF-PDGM, first external test set) and 0.618 (RHUH-GBM, second external test set). The model achieved significant discrimination between patients with favorable and unfavorable survival for all three datasets (logrank p 1.9\times{10}^{-8}, 9.7\times{10}^{-3}, and 1.2\times{10}^{-2}). Conclusions: The proposed transformer-based survival prediction model integrates complementary information from diverse input modalities, contributing to improved glioblastoma survival prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods. Consistent performance was observed across institutions supporting model generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Piras, Alicja Polanska, Alessio Spurio Mancini, Matthew A. Price, Jason D. McEwen</p>
<p>Abstract: We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply not feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although deep learning models have taken on commercial and political relevance, key aspects of their training and operation remain poorly understood. This has sparked interest in science of deep learning projects, many of which require large amounts of time, money, and electricity. But how much of this research really needs to occur at scale? In this paper, we introduce MNIST-1D: a minimalist, procedurally generated, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to classic deep learning benchmarks. Although the dimensionality of MNIST-1D is only 40 and its default training set size only 4000, MNIST-1D can be used to study inductive biases of different deep architectures, find lottery tickets, observe deep double descent, metalearn an activation function, and demonstrate guillotine regularization in self-supervised learning. All these experiments can be conducted on a GPU or often even on a CPU within minutes, allowing for fast prototyping, educational use cases, and cutting-edge research on a low budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian van Daalen, Lianne Ippel, Andre Dekker, Inigo Bermejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning makes it possible to train a machine learning model on decentralized data. Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models that have been widely used in artificial intelligence applications. Their popularity stems from the fact they can be built by combining existing expert knowledge with data and are highly interpretable, which makes them useful for decision support, e.g. in healthcare. While some research has been published on the federated learning of Bayesian networks, publications on Bayesian networks in a vertically partitioned or heterogeneous data setting (where different variables are located in different datasets) are limited, and suffer from important omissions, such as the handling of missing data. In this article, we propose a novel method called VertiBayes to train Bayesian networks (structure and parameters) on vertically partitioned data, which can handle missing values as well as an arbitrary number of parties. For structure learning we adapted the widely used K2 algorithm with a privacy-preserving scalar product protocol. For parameter learning, we use a two-step approach: first, we learn an intermediate model using maximum likelihood by treating missing values as a special value and then we train a model on synthetic data generated by the intermediate model using the EM algorithm. The privacy guarantees of our approach are equivalent to the ones provided by the privacy preserving scalar product protocol used. We experimentally show our approach produces models comparable to those learnt using traditional algorithms and we estimate the increase in complexity in terms of samples, network size, and complexity. Finally, we propose two alternative approaches to estimate the performance of the model using vertically partitioned data and we show in experiments that they lead to reasonably accurate estimates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective representation of molecules is a crucial factor affecting the performance of artificial intelligence models. This study introduces a flexible, fragment-based, multiscale molecular representation framework called t-SMILES (tree-based SMILES) with three code algorithms: TSSA, TSDY and TSID. It describes molecules using SMILES-type strings obtained by performing a breadth-first search on a full binary tree formed from a fragmented molecular graph. Systematic evaluations using JTVAE, BRICS, MMPA, and Scaffold show the feasibility of constructing a multi-code molecular description system, where various descriptions complement each other, enhancing the overall performance. In addition, it can avoid overfitting and achieve higher novelty scores while maintaining reasonable similarity on labeled low-resource datasets, regardless of whether the model is original, data-augmented, or pre-trained then fine-tuned. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms classical SMILES, DeepSMILES, SELFIES and baseline models in goal-directed tasks. And it surpasses state-of-the-art fragment, graph and SMILES based approaches on ChEMBL, Zinc, and QM9.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhang, Qi Meng, Rongchan Zhu, Yue Wang, Wenlei Shi, Shihua Zhang, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tie-Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function neural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis S\'anchez-Fern\'andez, Jes\'us A. Fisteus, Rafael L\'opez-Zaragoza</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to the instance selection problem in machine learning (or data mining). Our approach is based on recent results on (proportional) representation in approval-based multi-winner elections. In our model, instances play a double role as voters and candidates. The approval set of each instance in the training set (acting as a voter) is defined from the concept of local set, which already exists in the literature. We then select the election winners by using a representative voting rule, and such winners are the data instances kept in the reduced training set. Our experiments show that, for KNN, the rule Simple 2-EJR (a variant of the Simple EJR voting rule that satisfies 2-EJR) outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms and all the baselines that we consider in this paper in terms of accuracy vs reduction. For SVMs, we have obtained slight increases in the average accuracy by using several voting rules that satisfy EJR or PJR compared to the results obtained with the original datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cedric Doni\'e, Neha Das, Satoshi Endo, Sandra Hirche</p>
<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by frequently changing motor symptoms, necessitating continuous symptom monitoring for more targeted treatment. Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring, with InceptionTime's high learning capacity being well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches are suitable for estimating tremor severity and bradykinesia presence but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. ROCKET demonstrates superior performance in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia detection. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime exhibits the capability to classify complex wrist motion time series and holds the greatest potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yivan Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangling the explanatory factors in complex data is a promising approach for generalizable and data-efficient representation learning. While a variety of quantitative metrics for learning and evaluating disentangled representations have been proposed, it remains unclear what properties these metrics truly quantify. In this work, we establish a theoretical connection between logical definitions of disentanglement and quantitative metrics using topos theory and enriched category theory. We introduce a systematic approach for converting a first-order predicate into a real-valued quantity by replacing (i) equality with a strict premetric, (ii) the Heyting algebra of binary truth values with a quantale of continuous values, and (iii) quantifiers with aggregators. The metrics induced by logical definitions have strong theoretical guarantees, and some of them are easily differentiable and can be used as learning objectives directly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics by isolating different aspects of disentangled representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihyeong Jung, Sangwoo Seo, Sungwon Kim, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Unsupervised Episode Generation method called Neighbors as Queries (NaQ) to solve the Few-Shot Node-Classification (FSNC) task by unsupervised Graph Meta-learning. Doing so enables full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective unsupervised episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is model-agnostic, any existing supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised episode generation method for graph meta-learning towards the FSNC task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Jiang, Sijie Cheng, Jielin Qiu, Haoran Xu, Wai Kin Chan, Zhao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalent use of benchmarks in current offline reinforcement learning (RL) research has led to a neglect of the imbalance of real-world dataset distributions in the development of models. The real-world offline RL dataset is often imbalanced over the state space due to the challenge of exploration or safety considerations. In this paper, we specify properties of imbalanced datasets in offline RL, where the state coverage follows a power law distribution characterized by skewed policies. Theoretically and empirically, we show that typically offline RL methods based on distributional constraints, such as conservative Q-learning (CQL), are ineffective in extracting policies under the imbalanced dataset. Inspired by natural intelligence, we propose a novel offline RL method that utilizes the augmentation of CQL with a retrieval process to recall past related experiences, effectively alleviating the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets. We evaluate our method on several tasks in the context of imbalanced datasets with varying levels of imbalance, utilizing the variant of D4RL. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Liu, Pratik Chaudhari, Rasool Fakoor</p>
<p>Abstract: The main challenge of offline reinforcement learning, where data is limited, arises from a sequence of counterfactual reasoning dilemmas within the realm of potential actions: What if we were to choose a different course of action? These circumstances frequently give rise to extrapolation errors, which tend to accumulate exponentially with the problem horizon. Hence, it becomes crucial to acknowledge that not all decision steps are equally important to the final outcome, and to budget the number of counterfactual decisions a policy make in order to control the extrapolation. Contrary to existing approaches that use regularization on either the policy or value function, we propose an approach to explicitly bound the amount of out-of-distribution actions during training. Specifically, our method utilizes dynamic programming to decide where to extrapolate and where not to, with an upper bound on the decisions different from behavior policy. It balances between the potential for improvement from taking out-of-distribution actions and the risk of making errors due to extrapolation. Theoretically, we justify our method by the constrained optimality of the fixed point solution to our $Q$ updating rules. Empirically, we show that the overall performance of our method is better than the state-of-the-art offline RL methods on tasks in the widely-used D4RL benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangru Tang, Bill Qian, Rick Gao, Jiakang Chen, Xinyun Chen, Mark Gerstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved code generation. As these models scale up, there is an increasing need for the output to handle more intricate tasks and to be appropriately specialized to particular domains. Here, we target bioinformatics due to the amount of domain knowledge, algorithms, and data operations this discipline requires. We present BioCoder, a benchmark developed to evaluate LLMs in generating bioinformatics-specific code. BioCoder spans much of the field, covering cross-file dependencies, class declarations, and global variables. It incorporates 1,026 Python functions and 1,243 Java methods extracted from GitHub, along with 253 examples from the Rosalind Project, all pertaining to bioinformatics. Using topic modeling, we show that the overall coverage of the included code is representative of the full spectrum of bioinformatics calculations. BioCoder incorporates a fuzz-testing framework for evaluation. We have applied it to evaluate various models including InCoder, CodeGen, CodeGen2, SantaCoder, StarCoder, StarCoder+, InstructCodeT5+, GPT-3.5, and GPT- 4. Furthermore, we fine-tuned one model (StarCoder), demonstrating that our training dataset can enhance the performance on our testing benchmark (by >15% in terms of Pass@K under certain prompt configurations and always >3%). The results highlight two key aspects of successful models: (1) Successful models accommodate a long prompt (> 2,600 tokens) with full context, including functional dependencies. (2) They contain domain-specific knowledge of bioinformatics, beyond just general coding capability. This is evident from the performance gain of GPT-3.5/4 compared to the smaller models on our benchmark (50% vs. up to 25%).

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00203">Generalization Bound and Learning Methods for Data-Driven Projections in Linear Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinsaku Sakaue, Taihei Oki</p>
<p>Abstract: How to solve high-dimensional linear programs (LPs) efficiently is a fundamental question. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in reducing LP sizes using random projections, which can accelerate solving LPs independently of improving LP solvers. This paper explores a new direction of data-driven projections, which use projection matrices learned from data instead of random projection matrices. Given training data of $n$-dimensional LPs, we learn an $n\times k$ projection matrix with $n > k$. When addressing a future LP instance, we reduce its dimensionality from $n$ to $k$ via the learned projection matrix, solve the resulting LP to obtain a $k$-dimensional solution, and apply the learned matrix to it to recover an $n$-dimensional solution.
  On the theoretical side, a natural question is: how much data is sufficient to ensure the quality of recovered solutions? We address this question based on the framework of data-driven algorithm design, which connects the amount of data sufficient for establishing generalization bounds to the pseudo-dimension of performance metrics. We obtain an $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nk^2)$ upper bound on the pseudo-dimension, where $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}$ compresses logarithmic factors. We also provide an $\Omega(nk)$ lower bound, implying our result is tight up to an $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(k)$ factor.
  On the practical side, we explore two simple methods for learning projection matrices: PCA- and gradient-based methods. While the former is relatively efficient, the latter can sometimes achieve better solution quality. Experiments demonstrate that learning projection matrices from data is indeed beneficial: it leads to significantly higher solution quality than the existing random projection while greatly reducing the time for solving LPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Liu, Liangxi Liu, Feiyang Ye, Yunheng Shen, Xia Li, Linshan Jiang, Jialin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently aggregating trained neural networks from local clients into a global model on a server is a widely researched topic in federated learning. Recently, motivated by diminishing privacy concerns, mitigating potential attacks, and reducing communication overhead, one-shot federated learning (i.e., limiting client-server communication into a single round) has gained popularity among researchers. However, the one-shot aggregation performances are sensitively affected by the non-identical training data distribution, which exhibits high statistical heterogeneity in some real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel one-shot aggregation method with layer-wise posterior aggregation, named FedLPA. FedLPA aggregates local models to obtain a more accurate global model without requiring extra auxiliary datasets or exposing any private label information, e.g., label distributions. To effectively capture the statistics maintained in the biased local datasets in the practical non-IID scenario, we efficiently infer the posteriors of each layer in each local model using layer-wise Laplace approximation and aggregate them to train the global parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedLPA significantly improves learning performance over state-of-the-art methods across several metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khaled Mohammed Saifuddin, Mehmet Emin Aktas, Esra Akbas</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs, with their capacity to depict high-order relationships, have emerged as a significant extension of traditional graphs. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have remarkable performance in graph representation learning, their extension to hypergraphs encounters challenges due to their intricate structures. Furthermore, current hypergraph transformers, a special variant of GNN, utilize semantic feature-based self-attention, ignoring topological attributes of nodes and hyperedges. To address these challenges, we propose a Topology-guided Hypergraph Transformer Network (THTN). In this model, we first formulate a hypergraph from a graph while retaining its structural essence to learn higher-order relations within the graph. Then, we design a simple yet effective structural and spatial encoding module to incorporate the topological and spatial information of the nodes into their representation. Further, we present a structure-aware self-attention mechanism that discovers the important nodes and hyperedges from both semantic and structural viewpoints. By leveraging these two modules, THTN crafts an improved node representation, capturing both local and global topological expressions. Extensive experiments conducted on node classification tasks demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model consistently exceeds that of the existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simin Li, Ruixiao Xu, Jingqiao Xiu, Yuwei Zheng, Pu Feng, Yaodong Yang, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), ensuring robustness against unpredictable or worst-case actions by allies is crucial for real-world deployment. Existing robust MARL methods either approximate or enumerate all possible threat scenarios against worst-case adversaries, leading to computational intensity and reduced robustness. In contrast, human learning efficiently acquires robust behaviors in daily life without preparing for every possible threat. Inspired by this, we frame robust MARL as an inference problem, with worst-case robustness implicitly optimized under all threat scenarios via off-policy evaluation. Within this framework, we demonstrate that Mutual Information Regularization as Robust Regularization (MIR3) during routine training is guaranteed to maximize a lower bound on robustness, without the need for adversaries. Further insights show that MIR3 acts as an information bottleneck, preventing agents from over-reacting to others and aligning policies with robust action priors. In the presence of worst-case adversaries, our MIR3 significantly surpasses baseline methods in robustness and training efficiency while maintaining cooperative performance in StarCraft II and robot swarm control. When deploying the robot swarm control algorithm in the real world, our method also outperforms the best baseline by 14.29%.</p>

<p>Abstract: In materials science, the challenge of rapid prototyping materials with desired properties often involves extensive experimentation to find suitable microstructures. Additionally, finding microstructures for given properties is typically an ill-posed problem where multiple solutions may exist. Using generative machine learning models can be a viable solution which also reduces the computational cost. This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a continuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space for conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to condition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated microstructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design.</p>

<p>Abstract: The endeavor to preserve the generalization of a fair and invariant classifier across domains, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, becomes a significant and intricate challenge in machine learning. In response to this challenge, numerous effective algorithms have been developed with a focus on addressing the problem of fairness-aware domain generalization. These algorithms are designed to navigate various types of distribution shifts, with a particular emphasis on covariate and dependence shifts. In this context, covariate shift pertains to changes in the marginal distribution of input features, while dependence shift involves alterations in the joint distribution of the label variable and sensitive attributes. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective approach that aims to learn a fair and invariant classifier by simultaneously addressing both covariate and dependence shifts across domains. We assert the existence of an underlying transformation model can transform data from one domain to another, while preserving the semantics related to non-sensitive attributes and classes. By augmenting various synthetic data domains through the model, we learn a fair and invariant classifier in source domains. This classifier can then be generalized to unknown target domains, maintaining both model prediction and fairness concerns. Extensive empirical studies on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Yang, Tianlong Chen, Xuxi Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yingbin Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated success in various domains, yet their performance can be significantly degraded by even a small input perturbation. Consequently, the construction of such perturbations, known as adversarial attacks, has gained significant attention, many of which fall within "white-box" scenarios where we have full access to the neural network. Existing attack algorithms, such as the projected gradient descent (PGD), commonly take the sign function on the raw gradient before updating adversarial inputs, thereby neglecting gradient magnitude information. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of how such sign-based update algorithm influences step-wise attack performance, as well as its caveat. We also interpret why previous attempts of directly using raw gradients failed. Based on that, we further propose a new raw gradient descent (RGD) algorithm that eliminates the use of sign. Specifically, we convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one, by introducing a new hidden variable of non-clipped perturbation that can move beyond the constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed RGD algorithm has been demonstrated extensively in experiments, outperforming PGD and other competitors in various settings, without incurring any additional computational overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Yang, Hao Yang, Zhuang Zou, Linhe Xu, Shuo Yuan, Yifan Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the e-commerce advertising scenario, estimating the true probabilities (known as a calibrated estimate) on Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) is critical. Previous research has introduced numerous solutions for addressing the calibration problem. These methods typically involve the training of calibrators using a validation set and subsequently applying these calibrators to correct the original estimated values during online inference.
  However, what sets e-commerce advertising scenarios apart is the challenge of multi-field calibration. Multi-field calibration requires achieving calibration in each field. In order to achieve multi-field calibration, it is necessary to have a strong data utilization ability. Because the quantity of pCTR specified range for a single field-value (such as user ID and item ID) sample is relatively small, this makes the calibrator more difficult to train. However, existing methods have difficulty effectively addressing these issues.
  To solve these problems, we propose a new method named Deep Ensemble Shape Calibration (DESC). In terms of business understanding and interpretability, we decompose multi-field calibration into value calibration and shape calibration. We introduce innovative basis calibration functions, which enhance both function expression capabilities and data utilization by combining these basis calibration functions. A significant advancement lies in the development of an allocator capable of allocating the most suitable calibrators to different estimation error distributions within diverse fields and values. We achieve significant improvements in both public and industrial datasets. In online experiments, we observe a +2.5% increase in CVR and +4.0% in GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Cheng, Prashant Singh, Francesco Ferranti</p>
<p>Abstract: The simulation of nanophotonic structures relies on electromagnetic solvers, which play a crucial role in understanding their behavior. However, these solvers often come with a significant computational cost, making their application in design tasks, such as optimization, impractical. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques have been explored for accurate and efficient modeling and design of photonic devices. Deep neural networks, in particular, have gained considerable attention in this field. They can be used to create both forward and inverse models. An inverse modeling approach avoids the need for coupling a forward model with an optimizer and directly performs the prediction of the optimal design parameters values. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling method for nanophotonic structures, based on a mixture density network model enhanced by transfer learning. Mixture density networks can predict multiple possible solutions at a time including their respective importance as Gaussian distributions. However, multiple challenges exist for mixture density network models. An important challenge is that an upper bound on the number of possible simultaneous solutions needs to be specified in advance. Also, another challenge is that the model parameters must be jointly optimized, which can result computationally expensive. Moreover, optimizing all parameters simultaneously can be numerically unstable and can lead to degenerate predictions. The proposed approach allows overcoming these limitations using transfer learning-based techniques, while preserving a high accuracy in the prediction capability of the design solutions given an optical response as an input. A dimensionality reduction step is also explored. Numerical results validate the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Giraldo-Grueso, Andrey A. Popov, Renato Zanetti</p>
<p>Abstract: Spacecraft entering Mars require precise navigation algorithms capable of accurately estimating the vehicle's position and velocity in dynamic and uncertain atmospheric environments. Discrepancies between the true Martian atmospheric density and the onboard density model can significantly impair the performance of spacecraft entry navigation filters. This work introduces a new approach to online filtering for Martian entry using a neural network to estimate atmospheric density and employing a consider analysis to account for the uncertainty in the estimate. The network is trained on an exponential atmospheric density model, and its parameters are dynamically adapted in real time to account for any mismatch between the true and estimated densities. The adaptation of the network is formulated as a maximum likelihood problem by leveraging the measurement innovations of the filter to identify optimal network parameters. Within the context of the maximum likelihood approach, incorporating a neural network enables the use of stochastic optimizers known for their efficiency in the machine learning domain. Performance comparisons are conducted against two online adaptive approaches, covariance matching and state augmentation and correction, in various realistic Martian entry navigation scenarios. The results show superior estimation accuracy compared to other approaches, and precise alignment of the estimated density with a broad selection of realistic Martian atmospheres sampled from perturbed Mars-GRAM data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iris A. M. Huijben, Matthijs Douze, Matthew Muckley, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, Jakob Verbeek</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization is a fundamental operation for data compression and vector search. To obtain high accuracy, multi-codebook methods represent each vector using codewords across several codebooks. Residual quantization (RQ) is one such method, which iteratively quantizes the error of the previous step. While the error distribution is dependent on previously-selected codewords, this dependency is not accounted for in conventional RQ as it uses a fixed codebook per quantization step. In this paper, we propose QINCo, a neural RQ variant that constructs specialized codebooks per step that depend on the approximation of the vector from previous steps. Experiments show that QINCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several datasets and code sizes. For example, QINCo achieves better nearest-neighbor search accuracy using 12-byte codes than the state-of-the-art UNQ using 16 bytes on the BigANN1M and Deep1M datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chujie Zheng, Fan Yin, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Kai-Wei Chang, Minlie Huang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Will Lavanakul, Jason J. Choi, Koushil Sreenath, Claire J. Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based approaches are emerging as an effective approach for safety filters for black-box dynamical systems. Existing methods have relied on certificate functions like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions. The primary motivation for our work is the recognition that ultimately, enforcing the safety constraint as a control input constraint at each state is what matters. By focusing on this constraint, we can eliminate dependence on any specific certificate function-based design. To achieve this, we define a discriminating hyperplane that shapes the half-space constraint on control input at each state, serving as a sufficient condition for safety. This concept not only generalizes over traditional safety methods but also simplifies safety filter design by eliminating dependence on specific certificate functions. We present two strategies to learn the discriminating hyperplane: (a) a supervised learning approach, using pre-verified control invariant sets for labeling, and (b) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which does not require such labels. The main advantage of our method, unlike conventional safe RL approaches, is the separation of performance and safety. This offers a reusable safety filter for learning new tasks, avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. As such, we believe that the new notion of the discriminating hyperplane offers a more generalizable direction towards designing safety filters, encompassing and extending existing certificate-function-based or safe RL methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi, Randolf Scholz, Stefan Born, Lars Schmidt-Thieme</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunsheng Tian, Ane Zuniga, Xinwei Zhang, Johannes P. D\"urholt, Payel Das, Jie Chen, Wojciech Matusik, Mina Konakovi\'c Lukovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization has been successfully applied to optimize black-box functions where the number of evaluations is severely limited. However, in many real-world applications, it is hard or impossible to know in advance which designs are feasible due to some physical or system limitations. These issues lead to an even more challenging problem of optimizing an unknown function with unknown constraints. In this paper, we observe that in such scenarios optimal solution typically lies on the boundary between feasible and infeasible regions of the design space, making it considerably more difficult than that with interior optima. Inspired by this observation, we propose BE-CBO, a new Bayesian optimization method that efficiently explores the boundary between feasible and infeasible designs. To identify the boundary, we learn the constraints with an ensemble of neural networks that outperform the standard Gaussian Processes for capturing complex boundaries. Our method demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art methods through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: This research paper addresses the challenge of modality mismatch in multimodal learning, where the modalities available during inference differ from those available at training. We propose the Text-centric Alignment for Multi-Modality Learning (TAMML) approach, an innovative method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning and foundation models to enhance the generalizability of multimodal systems under these conditions. By leveraging the unique properties of text as a unified semantic space, TAMML demonstrates significant improvements in handling unseen, diverse, and unpredictable modality combinations. TAMML not only adapts to varying modalities but also maintains robust performance, showcasing the potential of foundation models in overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed-modality frameworks in embedding representations. This study contributes to the field by offering a flexible, effective solution for real-world applications where modality availability is dynamic and uncertain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e Artelt, Shubham Sharma, Freddy Lecu\'e, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide a popular method for analyzing the predictions of black-box systems, and they can offer the opportunity for computational recourse by suggesting actionable changes on how to change the input to obtain a different (i.e.\ more favorable) system output. However, recent work highlighted their vulnerability to different types of manipulations.
  This work studies the vulnerability of counterfactual explanations to data poisoning. We formally introduce and investigate data poisoning in the context of counterfactual explanations for increasing the cost of recourse on three different levels: locally for a single instance, or a sub-group of instances, or globally for all instances. In this context, we characterize and prove the correctness of several different data poisonings. We also empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods and toolboxes are vulnerable to such data poisoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Zheng, Shengjie Qiu, Qianli Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental learning (IL) is essential to realize the human-level intelligence in the neural network. However, existing IL scenarios and datasets are unqualified for assessing forgetting in PLMs, giving an illusion that PLMs do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose a challenging IL scenario called instance-incremental learning (IIL) and a novel dataset called Concept-1K, which supports an order of magnitude larger IL steps. Based on the experiments on Concept-1K, we reveal that billion-parameter PLMs still suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and the forgetting is affected by both model scale, pretraining, and buffer size. Furthermore, existing IL methods and a popular finetuning technique, LoRA, fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Our study provides a novel scenario for future studies to explore the catastrophic forgetting of PLMs and encourage more powerful techniques to be designed for alleviating the forgetting in PLMs. The data, code and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/codebase-for-incremental-learning-with-llm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuexin Chen, Ruichu Cai, Zhengting Huang, Yuxuan Zhu, Julien Horwood, Zhifeng Hao, Zijian Li, Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of explainability in machine learning. To address this problem, Feature Attribution Methods (FAMs) measure the contribution of each feature through a perturbation test, where the difference in prediction is compared under different perturbations. However, such perturbation tests may not accurately distinguish the contributions of different features, when their change in prediction is the same after perturbation. In order to enhance the ability of FAMs to distinguish different features' contributions in this challenging setting, we propose to utilize the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) that perturbing a feature is a necessary and sufficient cause for the prediction to change as a measure of feature importance. Our approach, Feature Attribution with Necessity and Sufficiency (FANS), computes the PNS via a perturbation test involving two stages (factual and interventional). In practice, to generate counterfactual samples, we use a resampling-based approach on the observed samples to approximate the required conditional distribution. We demonstrate that FANS outperforms existing attribution methods on six benchmarks. Our source code is available at \url{https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/FANS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhao, Zihan Qiu, Huijia Wu, Zili Wang, Zhaofeng He, Jie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) for language models has been proven effective in augmenting the capacity of models by dynamically routing each input token to a specific subset of experts for processing. Despite the success, most existing methods face a challenge for balance between sparsity and the availability of expert knowledge: enhancing performance through increased use of expert knowledge often results in diminishing sparsity during expert selection. To mitigate this contradiction, we propose HyperMoE, a novel MoE framework built upon Hypernetworks. This framework integrates the computational processes of MoE with the concept of knowledge transferring in multi-task learning. Specific modules generated based on the information of unselected experts serve as supplementary information, which allows the knowledge of experts not selected to be used while maintaining selection sparsity. Our comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and backbones establish that HyperMoE significantly outperforms existing MoE methods under identical conditions concerning the number of experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YongKyung Oh, Dongyoung Lim, Sungil Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ka Man Lo, Yiming Liang, Wenyu Du, Yuantao Fan, Zili Wang, Wenhao Huang, Lei Ma, Jie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modular neural architectures are gaining attention for their powerful generalization and efficient adaptation to new domains. However, training these models poses challenges due to optimization difficulties arising from intrinsic sparse connectivity. Leveraging knowledge from monolithic models through techniques like knowledge distillation can facilitate training and enable integration of diverse knowledge. Nevertheless, conventional knowledge distillation approaches are not tailored to modular models and struggle with unique architectures and enormous parameter counts. Motivated by these challenges, we propose module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD) for transferring knowledge between modules. m2mKD combines teacher modules of a pretrained monolithic model and student modules of a modular model with a shared meta model respectively to encourage the student module to mimic the behaviour of the teacher module. We evaluate m2mKD on two modular neural architectures: Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) and Vision Mixture-of-Experts (V-MoE). Applying m2mKD to NACs yields significant improvements in IID accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet (up to 5.6%) and OOD robustness on Tiny-ImageNet-R (up to 4.2%). Additionally, the V-MoE-Base model trained with m2mKD achieves 3.5% higher accuracy than end-to-end training on ImageNet-1k. Code is available at https://github.com/kamanphoebe/m2mKD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the probabilities of user feedback, such as clicks and conversions, is critical for advertisement ranking and bidding. However, there often exist unwanted mismatches between predicted probabilities and true likelihoods due to the rapid shift of data distributions and intrinsic model biases. Calibration aims to address this issue by post-processing model predictions, and field-aware calibration can adjust model output on different feature field values to satisfy fine-grained advertising demands. Unfortunately, the observed samples corresponding to certain field values can be seriously limited to make confident calibrations, which may yield bias amplification and online disturbance. In this paper, we propose a confidence-aware multi-field calibration method, which adaptively adjusts the calibration intensity based on confidence levels derived from sample statistics. It also utilizes multiple fields for joint model calibration according to their importance to mitigate the impact of data sparsity on a single field. Extensive offline and online experiments show the superiority of our method in boosting advertising performance and reducing prediction deviations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Hayes, Ilia Shumailov, Eleni Triantafillou, Amr Khalifa, Nicolas Papernot</p>
<p>Abstract: The high cost of model training makes it increasingly desirable to develop techniques for unlearning. These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their "U-MIA" counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into "population U-MIAs", where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and "per-example U-MIAs", where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the different rates at which examples are unlearned. We demonstrate that naive attempts at tailoring unlearning stopping criteria to different examples fail to alleviate these issues.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations constitute among the most popular methods for analyzing black-box systems since they can recommend cost-efficient and actionable changes to the input of a system to obtain the desired system output. While most of the existing counterfactual methods explain a single instance, several real-world problems, such as customer satisfaction, require the identification of a single counterfactual that can satisfy multiple instances (e.g. customers) simultaneously. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a flexible two-stage algorithm for finding groups of instances and computing cost-efficient multi-instance counterfactual explanations. The paper presents the algorithm and its performance against popular alternatives through a comparative evaluation.</p>

Here, we discuss the closely related problem of quantifying realism, that is, designing functions that can reliably tell realistic data from unrealistic data. This problem turns out to be significantly harder to solve and remains poorly understood, despite its prevalence in machine learning and recent breakthroughs in generative AI. Drawing on insights from algorithmic information theory, we discuss why this problem is challenging, why a good generative model alone is insufficient to solve it, and what a good solution would look like. In particular, we introduce the notion of a universal critic, which unlike adversarial critics does not require adversarial training. While universal critics are not immediately practical, they can serve both as a North Star for guiding practical implementations and as a tool for analyzing existing attempts to capture realism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Huang, Wencai Cao, Hoang Ta, Xiaokui Xiao, Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known as spectral graph filters, find a wide range of applications in web networks. To bypass eigendecomposition, polynomial graph filters are proposed to approximate graph filters by leveraging various polynomial bases for filter training. However, no existing studies have explored the diverse polynomial graph filters from a unified perspective for optimization.
  In this paper, we first unify polynomial graph filters, as well as the optimal filters of identical degrees into the Krylov subspace of the same order, thus providing equivalent expressive power theoretically. Next, we investigate the asymptotic convergence property of polynomials from the unified Krylov subspace perspective, revealing their limited adaptability in graphs with varying heterophily degrees. Inspired by those facts, we design a novel adaptive Krylov subspace approach to optimize polynomial bases with provable controllability over the graph spectrum so as to adapt various heterophily graphs. Subsequently, we propose AdaptKry, an optimized polynomial graph filter utilizing bases from the adaptive Krylov subspaces. Meanwhile, in light of the diverse spectral properties of complex graphs, we extend AdaptKry by leveraging multiple adaptive Krylov bases without incurring extra training costs. As a consequence, extended AdaptKry is able to capture the intricate characteristics of graphs and provide insights into their inherent complexity. We conduct extensive experiments across a series of real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior filtering capability of AdaptKry, as well as the optimized efficacy of the adaptive Krylov basis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep neural networks poses significant barriers to democratizing them to resource-limited edge devices. To address this challenge, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising solution by of floading the primary training workload to a server via model partitioning while enabling parallel training among edge devices. However, although system optimization substantially influences the performance of SFL under resource-constrained systems, the problem remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of SFL which quantifies the impact of model splitting (MS) and client-side model aggregation (MA) on the learning performance, serving as a theoretical foundation. Then, we propose AdaptSFL, a novel resource-adaptive SFL framework, to expedite SFL under resource-constrained edge computing systems. Specifically, AdaptSFL adaptively controls client-side MA and MS to balance communication-computing latency and training convergence. Extensive simulations across various datasets validate that our proposed AdaptSFL framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Integrating machine learning into Automated Control Systems (ACS) enhances decision-making in industrial process management. One of the limitations to the widespread adoption of these technologies in industry is the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This study explores the threats in deploying deep learning models for fault diagnosis in ACS using the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. By evaluating three neural networks with different architectures, we subject them to six types of adversarial attacks and explore five different defense methods. Our results highlight the strong vulnerability of models to adversarial samples and the varying effectiveness of defense strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Lavin</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the breakthrough performance of AlexNet in 2012, convolutional neural networks (convnets) have grown into extremely powerful vision models. Deep learning researchers have used convnets to perform vision tasks with accuracy that was unachievable a decade ago. Confronted with the immense computation that convnets use, deep learning researchers also became interested in efficiency. However, the engineers who deployed efficient convnets soon realized that they were slower than the previous generation, despite using fewer operations. Many reverted to older models that ran faster. Hence researchers switched the objective of their search from arithmetic complexity to latency and produced a new wave of models that performed better. Paradoxically, these models also used more operations. Skepticism grew among researchers and engineers alike about the relevance of arithmetic complexity. Contrary to the prevailing view that latency and arithmetic complexity are irreconcilable, a simple formula relates both through computational efficiency. This insight enabled us to co-optimize the separate factors that determine latency. We observed that the degenerate conv2d layers that produce the best accuracy--complexity trade-off also use significant memory resources and have low computational efficiency. We devised block fusion algorithms to implement all the layers of a residual block in a single kernel, thereby creating temporal locality, avoiding communication, and reducing workspace size. Our ConvFirst model with block-fusion kernels has less arithmetic complexity and greater computational efficiency than baseline models and kernels, and ran approximately four times as fast as ConvNeXt. We also created novel tools, including efficiency gap plots and waterline analysis. Our unified approach to convnet efficiency envisions a new era of models and kernels that achieve greater accuracy at lower cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Zhao, Haixia Han, Jie Shi, Chengyu Du, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: As world knowledge evolves and new task paradigms emerge, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall short of meeting new demands due to knowledge deficiencies and outdated information. Continual Learning (CL) is crucial for keeping LLMs up-to-date and addressing these deficiencies. However, traditional CL approaches struggle to balance task-width generality with task-depth specificity and often lack efficient data collection strategies, leading to increased training costs without addressing the model's most critical needs.
  Inspired by the `summarizing mistakes' learning skill, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method. This iterative approach continually evaluates LLMs to identify knowledge deficiencies based on their mistakes, collecting relevant data from multiple sources to supplement training in a targeted manner. To enhance the model's utilization of supplemental knowledge and prevent forgetting, we developed three dataset construction strategies that integrate various types of continual pretraining (CPT) data and continual instruction tuning (CIT) data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the CEM method, achieving up to a 17% improvement in LLM accuracy in the best scenarios. Additionally, further experiments confirm the potential of combining CEM with other catastrophic forgetting mitigation strategies, enabling multi-round iterative optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Doron Haviv, Russell Zhang Kunes, Thomas Dougherty, Cassandra Burdziak, Tal Nawy, Anna Gilbert, Dana Pe'er</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric (W) are powerful and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of the alignment problem stems from the fact that existing methods are considered unstable. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) addresses this issue by minimizing the KL divergence between the trained policy and the initial supervised fine-tuned policy (SFT) to avoid generating out-of-domain samples for the reward model (RM). Recently, many methods have emerged that shift from online to offline optimization, reformulating the RLHF objective and removing the reward model (DPO, IPO, KTO). Despite eliminating the reward model and the challenges it posed, these algorithms are still constrained in terms of closeness of the trained policy to the SFT one. In our paper, we argue that this implicit limitation in the offline optimization methods leads to suboptimal results. To address this issue, we propose a class of new methods called Trust Region (TR-DPO, TR-IPO, TR-KTO), which update the reference policy during training. With this straightforward update approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new paradigm of language model alignment against the classical one on the Anthropic-HH and Reddit TL;DR datasets. Most notably, when automatically comparing TR methods and baselines side by side using pretrained Pythia 6.9B models on the Reddit TL;DR task, the difference in win rates reaches 8.4% for DPO, 14.3% for IPO, and 15% for KTO. Finally, by assessing model response ratings grounded on criteria such as coherence, correctness, helpfulness, and harmlessness, we demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly outperform existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjiang Hu, Jianglin Lan, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe control of neural network dynamic models (NNDMs) is important to robotics and many applications. However, it remains challenging to compute an optimal safe control in real time for NNDM. To enable real-time computation, we propose to use a sound approximation of the NNDM in the control synthesis. In particular, we propose Bernstein over-approximated neural dynamics (BOND) based on the Bernstein polynomial over-approximation (BPO) of ReLU activation functions in NNDM. To mitigate the errors introduced by the approximation and to ensure persistent feasibility of the safe control problems, we synthesize a worst-case safety index using the most unsafe approximated state within the BPO relaxation of NNDM offline. For the online real-time optimization, we formulate the first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear worst-case safety constraint as an additional linear layer of NNDM with the l2 bounded bias term for the higher-order remainder. Comprehensive experiments with different neural dynamics and safety constraints show that with safety guaranteed, our NNDMs with sound approximation are 10-100 times faster than the safe control baseline that uses mixed integer programming (MIP), validating the effectiveness of the worst-case safety index and scalability of the proposed BOND in real-time large-scale settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linyu Liu, Yu Pan, Xiaocheng Li, Guanting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty estimation and calibration for LLMs. We first formulate the uncertainty estimation problem for LLMs and then propose a supervised approach that takes advantage of the labeled datasets and estimates the uncertainty of the LLMs' responses. Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference between the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and explain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information. Our designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations to enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust transferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty estimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that a better uncertainty estimation mode leads to a better calibration performance. Furthermore, our method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model accessibility including black box, grey box, and white box.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David J. Schodt</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) extend traditional neural networks to provide uncertainties associated with their outputs. On the forward pass through a BNN, predictions (and their uncertainties) are made either by Monte Carlo sampling network weights from the learned posterior or by analytically propagating statistical moments through the network. Though flexible, Monte Carlo sampling is computationally expensive and can be infeasible or impractical under resource constraints or for large networks. While moment propagation can ameliorate the computational costs of BNN inference, it can be difficult or impossible for networks with arbitrary nonlinearities, thereby restricting the possible set of network layers permitted with such a scheme. In this work, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach for propagating statistical moments through arbitrary nonlinearities with only 3 deterministic samples, enabling few-sample variational inference of BNNs without restricting the set of network layers used. Furthermore, we leverage this approach to demonstrate a novel nonlinear activation function that we use to inject physics-informed prior information into output nodes of a BNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) quantifies network uncertainty by building a small prediction set with a pre-defined probability that the correct class is within this set. In this study we tackle the problem of CP calibration based on a validation set with noisy labels. We introduce a conformal score that is robust to label noise. The noise-free conformal score is estimated using the noisy labeled data and the noise level. In the test phase the noise-free score is used to form the prediction set. We applied the proposed algorithm to several standard medical imaging classification datasets. We show that our method outperforms current methods by a large margin, in terms of the average size of the prediction set, while maintaining the required coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amey Agrawal, Nitin Kedia, Jayashree Mohan, Ashish Panwar, Nipun Kwatra, Bhargav Gulavani, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing the deployment of Large language models (LLMs) is expensive today since it requires experimentally running an application workload against an LLM implementation while exploring large configuration space formed by system knobs such as parallelization strategies, batching techniques, and scheduling policies. To address this challenge, we present Vidur - a large-scale, high-fidelity, easily-extensible simulation framework for LLM inference performance. Vidur models the performance of LLM operators using a combination of experimental profiling and predictive modeling, and evaluates the end-to-end inference performance for different workloads by estimating several metrics of interest such as latency and throughput. We validate the fidelity of Vidur on several LLMs and show that it estimates inference latency with less than 9% error across the range. Further, we present Vidur-Search, a configuration search tool that helps optimize LLM deployment. Vidur-Search uses Vidur to automatically identify the most cost-effective deployment configuration that meets application performance constraints. For example, Vidur-Search finds the best deployment configuration for LLaMA2-70B in one hour on a CPU machine, in contrast to a deployment-based exploration which would require 42K GPU hours - costing ~218K dollars.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Tran Dang, Kevin Delmas, J\'er\'emie Guiochet, Joris Gu\'erin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing use of neural networks in critical systems, runtime monitoring becomes essential to reject unsafe predictions during inference. Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sensor placement optimization methods have been studied extensively. They can be applied to a wide range of applications, including surveillance of known environments, optimal locations for 5G towers, and placement of missile defense systems. However, few works explore the robustness and efficiency of the resulting sensor network concerning sensor failure or adversarial attacks. This paper addresses this issue by optimizing for the least number of sensors to achieve multiple coverage of non-simply connected domains by a prescribed number of sensors. We introduce a new objective function for the greedy (next-best-view) algorithm to design efficient and robust sensor networks and derive theoretical bounds on the network's optimality. We further introduce a Deep Learning model to accelerate the algorithm for near real-time computations. The Deep Learning model requires the generation of training examples. Correspondingly, we show that understanding the geometric properties of the training data set provides important insights into the performance and training process of deep learning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple parallel version of the greedy approach using a simpler objective can be highly competitive.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the main theoretical challenges in learning dynamical systems from data is providing upper bounds on the generalization error, that is, the difference between the expected prediction error and the empirical prediction error measured on some finite sample. In machine learning, a popular class of such bounds are the so-called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds. In this paper, we derive a PAC bound for stable continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. Our bound depends on the H2 norm of the chosen class of the LPV systems, but does not depend on the time interval for which the signals are considered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenguo Li, Xinling Guo, Xu Jiao, Tiancheng Huang, Xiaoran Yan, Yao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), which has a broad range of real-world applications, has received much attention in both academia and industry. Enterprises aspire to exploit more valuable features of the same users from diverse departments to boost their model prediction skills. VFL addresses this demand and concurrently secures individual parties from exposing their raw data. However, conventional VFL encounters a bottleneck as it only leverages aligned samples, whose size shrinks with more parties involved, resulting in data scarcity and the waste of unaligned data. To address this problem, we propose a novel VFL Hybrid Local Pre-training (VFLHLP) approach. VFLHLP first pre-trains local networks on the local data of participating parties. Then it utilizes these pre-trained networks to adjust the sub-model for the labeled party or enhance representation learning for other parties during downstream federated learning on aligned data, boosting the performance of federated models. The experimental results on real-world advertising datasets, demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance over baseline methods by large margins. The ablation study further illustrates the contribution of each technique in VFLHLP to its overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture for operator learning, the ensemble DeepONet, that allows for enriching the trunk network of a single DeepONet with multiple distinct trunk networks. This trunk enrichment allows for greater expressivity and generalization capabilities over a range of operator learning problems. We also present a spatial mixture-of-experts (MoE) DeepONet trunk network architecture that utilizes a partition-of-unity (PoU) approximation to promote spatial locality and model sparsity in the operator learning problem. We first prove that both the ensemble and PoU-MoE DeepONets are universal approximators. We then demonstrate that ensemble DeepONets containing a trunk ensemble of a standard trunk, the PoU-MoE trunk, and/or a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) trunk can achieve 2-4x lower relative $\ell_2$ errors than standard DeepONets and POD-DeepONets on both standard and challenging new operator learning problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) in two and three dimensions. Our new PoU-MoE formulation provides a natural way to incorporate spatial locality and model sparsity into any neural network architecture, while our new ensemble DeepONet provides a powerful and general framework for incorporating basis enrichment in scientific machine learning architectures for operator learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Wang, Anda Cheng, Yinggui Wang, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data privacy. This study aims to investigate the potential for privacy invasion through input reconstruction attacks, in which a malicious model provider could potentially recover user inputs from embeddings. We first propose two base methods to reconstruct original texts from a model's hidden states. We find that these two methods are effective in attacking the embeddings from shallow layers, but their effectiveness decreases when attacking embeddings from deeper layers. To address this issue, we then present Embed Parrot, a Transformer-based method, to reconstruct input from embeddings in deep layers. Our analysis reveals that Embed Parrot effectively reconstructs original inputs from the hidden states of ChatGLM-6B and Llama2-7B, showcasing stable performance across various token lengths and data distributions. To mitigate the risk of privacy breaches, we introduce a defense mechanism to deter exploitation of the embedding reconstruction process. Our findings emphasize the importance of safeguarding user privacy in distributed learning systems and contribute valuable insights to enhance the security protocols within such environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhan Bae, Wu Lin, Jonathan Lorraine, Roger Grosse</p>
<p>Abstract: Many training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to estimate how a model's behavior would change if one or more data points were removed from the training set. Methods based on implicit differentiation, such as influence functions, can be made computationally efficient, but fail to account for underspecification, the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm, or multi-stage training pipelines. By contrast, methods based on unrolling address these issues but face scalability challenges. In this work, we connect the implicit-differentiation-based and unrolling-based approaches and combine their benefits by introducing Source, an approximate unrolling-based TDA method that is computed using an influence-function-like formula. While being computationally efficient compared to unrolling-based approaches, Source is suitable in cases where implicit-differentiation-based approaches struggle, such as in non-converged models and multi-stage training pipelines. Empirically, Source outperforms existing TDA techniques in counterfactual prediction, especially in settings where implicit-differentiation-based approaches fall short.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadsajad Abavisani, David Danks, Sergey Plis</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Existing algorithms provide limited resources to respond to this challenge, and so researchers must either use models that they know are likely misleading, or else forego causal learning entirely. Existing methods face up-to-four distinct shortfalls, as they might 1) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; 2) only handle very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; 3) only apply to pairs of variables; or 4) be unable to find a solution given statistical noise in the data. This research addresses these challenges. Our approach combines constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions to achieve multiple orders of magnitude in speed-up. The resulting system maintains theoretical guarantees while scaling to significantly larger sets of random variables (>100) without knowledge of timescale differences. This method is also robust to edge misidentification and can use parametric connection strengths, while optionally finding the optimal solution among many possible ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we consider minimizing the average of a very large number of smooth and possibly non-convex functions, and we focus on two widely used minibatch frameworks to tackle this optimization problem: Incremental Gradient (IG) and Random Reshuffling (RR). We define ease-controlled modifications of the IG/RR schemes, which require a light additional computational effort {but} can be proved to converge under {weak} and standard assumptions. In particular, we define two algorithmic schemes in which the IG/RR iteration is controlled by using a watchdog rule and a derivative-free linesearch that activates only sporadically to guarantee convergence. The two schemes differ in the watchdog and the linesearch, which are performed using either a monotonic or a non-monotonic rule. The two schemes also allow controlling the updating of the stepsize used in the main IG/RR iteration, avoiding the use of pre-set rules that may drive the stepsize to zero too fast, reducing the effort in designing effective updating rules of the stepsize. We prove convergence under the mild assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradients of the component functions and perform extensive computational analysis using different deep neural architectures and a benchmark of varying-size datasets. We compare our implementation with both a full batch gradient method (i.e. L-BFGS) and an implementation of IG/RR methods, proving that our algorithms require a similar computational effort compared to the other online algorithms and that the control on the learning rate may allow a faster decrease of the objective function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuezhen Li, Can M. Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational inference has been widely used in machine learning literature to fit various Bayesian models. In network analysis, this method has been successfully applied to solve the community detection problems. Although these results are promising, their theoretical support is only for relatively dense networks, an assumption that may not hold for real networks. In addition, it has been shown recently that the variational loss surface has many saddle points, which may severely affect its performance, especially when applied to sparse networks. This paper proposes a simple way to improve the variational inference method by hard thresholding the posterior of the community assignment after each iteration. Using a random initialization that correlates with the true community assignment, we show that the proposed method converges and can accurately recover the true community labels, even when the average node degree of the network is bounded. Extensive numerical study further confirms the advantage of the proposed method over the classical variational inference and another state-of-the-art algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Gao, Deniz Gunduz</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) model representations from networked data and allow for decentralized inference through localized communications. Existing GNN architectures often assume ideal communications and ignore potential channel effects, such as fading and noise, leading to performance degradation in real-world implementation. Considering a GNN implemented over nodes connected through wireless links, this paper conducts a stability analysis to study the impact of channel impairments on the performance of GNNs, and proposes graph neural networks over the air (AirGNNs), a novel GNN architecture that incorporates the communication model. AirGNNs modify graph convolutional operations that shift graph signals over random communication graphs to take into account channel fading and noise when aggregating features from neighbors, thus, improving architecture robustness to channel impairments during testing. We develop a channel-inversion signal transmission strategy for AirGNNs when channel state information (CSI) is available, and propose a stochastic gradient descent based method to train AirGNNs when CSI is unknown. The convergence analysis shows that the training procedure approaches a stationary solution of an associated stochastic optimization problem and the variance analysis characterizes the statistical behavior of the trained model. Experiments on decentralized source localization and multi-robot flocking corroborate theoretical findings and show superior performance of AirGNNs over wireless communication channels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yamin Sepehri, Pedram Pad, Ahmet Caner Y\"uz\"ug\"uler, Pascal Frossard, L. Andrea Dunbar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art accuracy for vision tasks but they require significant resources for training. Thus, they are trained on cloud servers far from the edge devices that acquire the data. This issue increases communication cost, runtime and privacy concerns. In this study, a novel hierarchical training method for deep neural networks is proposed that uses early exits in a divided architecture between edge and cloud workers to reduce the communication cost, training runtime and privacy concerns. The method proposes a brand-new use case for early exits to separate the backward pass of neural networks between the edge and the cloud during the training phase. We address the issues of most available methods that due to the sequential nature of the training phase, cannot train the levels of hierarchy simultaneously or they do it with the cost of compromising privacy. In contrast, our method can use both edge and cloud workers simultaneously, does not share the raw input data with the cloud and does not require communication during the backward pass. Several simulations and on-device experiments for different neural network architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. It is shown that the proposed method reduces the training runtime for VGG-16 and ResNet-18 architectures by 29% and 61% in CIFAR-10 classification and by 25% and 81% in Tiny ImageNet classification when the communication with the cloud is done over a low bit rate channel. This gain in the runtime is achieved whilst the accuracy drop is negligible. This method is advantageous for online learning of high-accuracy deep neural networks on sensor-holding low-resource devices such as mobile phones or robots as a part of an edge-cloud system, making them more flexible in facing new tasks and classes of data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinan Feng, Yinpeng Chen, Peng Jin, Shihang Feng, Zicheng Liu, Youzuo Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Subsurface imaging involves solving full waveform inversion (FWI) to predict geophysical properties from measurements. This problem can be reframed as an image-to-image translation, with the usual approach being to train an encoder-decoder network using paired data from two domains: geophysical property and measurement. A recent seminal work (InvLINT) demonstrates there is only a linear mapping between the latent spaces of the two domains, and the decoder requires paired data for training.
  This paper extends this direction by demonstrating that only linear mapping necessitates paired data, while both the encoder and decoder can be learned from their respective domains through self-supervised learning. This unveils an intriguing phenomenon (named Auto-Linear) where the self-learned features of two separate domains are automatically linearly correlated. Compared with existing methods, our Auto-Linear has four advantages: (a) solving both forward and inverse modeling simultaneously, (b) applicable to different subsurface imaging tasks and achieving markedly better results than previous methods, (c)enhanced performance, especially in scenarios with limited paired data and in the presence of noisy data, and (d) strong generalization ability of the trained encoder and decoder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Zhengyi Wang, Xiao Yang, Chengqi Duan, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been applied to improve adversarial robustness of image classifiers by purifying the adversarial noises or generating realistic data for adversarial training. However, diffusion-based purification can be evaded by stronger adaptive attacks while adversarial training does not perform well under unseen threats, exhibiting inevitable limitations of these methods. To better harness the expressive power of diffusion models, this paper proposes Robust Diffusion Classifier (RDC), a generative classifier that is constructed from a pre-trained diffusion model to be adversarially robust. RDC first maximizes the data likelihood of a given input and then predicts the class probabilities of the optimized input using the conditional likelihood estimated by the diffusion model through Bayes' theorem. To further reduce the computational cost, we propose a new diffusion backbone called multi-head diffusion and develop efficient sampling strategies. As RDC does not require training on particular adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that it is more generalizable to defend against multiple unseen threats. In particular, RDC achieves $75.67\%$ robust accuracy against various $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded adaptive attacks with $\epsilon_\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art adversarial training models by $+4.77\%$. The results highlight the potential of generative classifiers by employing pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial robustness compared with the commonly studied discriminative classifiers.

<p>Abstract: High-content cellular imaging, transcriptomics, and proteomics data provide rich and complementary views on the molecular layers of biology that influence cellular states and function. However, the biological determinants through which changes in multi-omics measurements influence cellular morphology have not yet been systematically explored, and the degree to which cell imaging could potentially enable the prediction of multi-omics directly from cell imaging data is therefore currently unclear. Here, we address the question of whether it is possible to predict bulk multi-omics measurements directly from cell images using Image2Omics - a deep learning approach that predicts multi-omics in a cell population directly from high-content images of cells stained with multiplexed fluorescent dyes. We perform an experimental evaluation in gene-edited macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) under multiple stimulation conditions and demonstrate that Image2Omics achieves significantly better performance in predicting transcriptomics and proteomics measurements directly from cell images than predictions based on the mean observed training set abundance. We observed significant predictability of abundances for 4927 (18.72%; 95% CI: 6.52%, 35.52%) and 3521 (13.38%; 95% CI: 4.10%, 32.21%) transcripts out of 26137 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively and for 422 (8.46%; 95% CI: 0.58%, 25.83%) and 697 (13.98%; 95% CI: 2.41%, 32.83%) proteins out of 4986 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively. Our results show that some transcript and protein abundances are predictable from cell imaging and that cell imaging may potentially, in some settings and depending on the mechanisms of interest and desired performance threshold, even be a scalable and resource-efficient substitute for multi-omics measurements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum state reconstruction using Neural Quantum States has been proposed as a viable tool to reduce quantum shot complexity in practical applications, and its advantage over competing techniques has been shown in numerical experiments focusing mainly on the noiseless case. In this work, we numerically investigate the performance of different quantum state reconstruction techniques for mixed states: the finite-temperature Ising model. We show how to systematically reduce the quantum resource requirement of the algorithms by applying variance reduction techniques. Then, we compare the two leading neural quantum state encodings of the state, namely, the Neural Density Operator and the positive operator-valued measurement representation, and illustrate their different performance as the mixedness of the target state varies. We find that certain encodings are more efficient in different regimes of mixedness and point out the need for designing more efficient encodings in terms of both classical and quantum resources.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12564">Towards Generalising Neural Topical Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Yang, He Zhao, Dinh Phung, Lan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Topic models have evolved from conventional Bayesian probabilistic models to recent Neural Topic Models (NTMs). Although NTMs have shown promising performance when trained and tested on a specific corpus, their generalisation ability across corpora has yet to be studied. In practice, we often expect that an NTM trained on a source corpus can still produce quality topical representation (i.e., latent distribution over topics) for the document from different target corpora. In this work, we aim to improve NTMs further so that their representation power for documents generalises reliably across corpora and tasks. To do so, we propose to enhance NTMs by narrowing the semantical distance between similar documents, with the underlying assumption that documents from different corpora may share similar semantics. Specifically, we obtain a similar document for each training document by text data augmentation. Then, we optimise NTMs further by minimising the semantical distance between each pair, measured by the Hierarchical Topic Transport Distance, which computes the Optimal Transport (OT) distance between their topical representations. Our framework can be readily applied to most NTMs as a plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves the generalisation ability regarding neural topical representation across corpora.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego P\'erez-L\'opez, Fernando Ortega, \'Angel Gonz\'alez-Prieto, Jorge Due\~nas-Ler\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems are intrinsically tied to a reliability/coverage dilemma: The more reliable we desire the forecasts, the more conservative the decision will be and thus, the fewer items will be recommended. This causes a detriment to the predictive capability of the system, as it is only able to estimate potential interest in items for which there is a consensus in their evaluation, rather than being able to estimate potential interest in any item. In this paper, we propose the inclusion of a new term in the learning process of matrix factorization-based recommender systems, called recklessness, that takes into account the variance of the output probability distribution of the predicted ratings. In this way, gauging this recklessness measure we can force more spiky output distribution, enabling the control of the risk level desired when making decisions about the reliability of a prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that recklessness not only allows for risk regulation but also improves the quantity and quality of predictions provided by the recommender system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Wodzinski, Mateusz Daniol, Daria Hemmerling, Miroslaw Socha</p>
<p>Abstract: Each year thousands of people suffer from various types of cranial injuries and require personalized implants whose manual design is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, an automatic, dedicated system to increase the availability of personalized cranial reconstruction is highly desirable. The problem of the automatic cranial defect reconstruction can be formulated as the shape completion task and solved using dedicated deep networks. Currently, the most common approach is to use the volumetric representation and apply deep networks dedicated to image segmentation. However, this approach has several limitations and does not scale well into high-resolution volumes, nor takes into account the data sparsity. In our work, we reformulate the problem into a point cloud completion task. We propose an iterative, transformer-based method to reconstruct the cranial defect at any resolution while also being fast and resource-efficient during training and inference. We compare the proposed methods to the state-of-the-art volumetric approaches and show superior performance in terms of GPU memory consumption while maintaining high-quality of the reconstructed defects.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to performing fitness approximation in genetic algorithms (GAs) using machine-learning (ML) models, through dynamic adaptation to the evolutionary state. Maintaining a dataset of sampled individuals along with their actual fitness scores, we continually update a fitness-approximation ML model throughout an evolutionary run. We compare different methods for: 1) switching between actual and approximate fitness, 2) sampling the population, and 3) weighting the samples. Experimental findings demonstrate significant improvement in evolutionary runtimes, with fitness scores that are either identical or slightly lower than that of the fully run GA -- depending on the ratio of approximate-to-actual-fitness computation. Although we focus on evolutionary agents in Gymnasium (game) simulators -- where fitness computation is costly -- our approach is generic and can be easily applied to many different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Pepino, Pablo Riera, Luciana Ferrer</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of universal audio representation learning is to obtain foundational models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks involving speech, music and environmental sounds. To approach this problem, methods inspired by works on self-supervised learning for NLP, like BERT, or computer vision, like masked autoencoders (MAE), are often adapted to the audio domain. In this work, we propose masking representations of the audio signal, and training a MAE to reconstruct the masked segments. The reconstruction is done by predicting the discrete units generated by EnCodec, a neural audio codec, from the unmasked inputs. We evaluate this approach, which we call EnCodecMAE, on a wide range of tasks involving speech, music and environmental sounds. Our best model outperforms various state-of-the-art audio representation models in terms of global performance. Additionally, we evaluate the resulting representations in the challenging task of automatic speech recognition (ASR), obtaining decent results and paving the way for a universal audio representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum computing has recently emerged as a transformative technology. Yet, its promised advantages rely on efficiently translating quantum operations into viable physical realizations. In this work, we use generative machine learning models, specifically denoising diffusion models (DMs), to facilitate this transformation. Leveraging text-conditioning, we steer the model to produce desired quantum operations within gate-based quantum circuits. Notably, DMs allow to sidestep during training the exponential overhead inherent in the classical simulation of quantum dynamics -- a consistent bottleneck in preceding ML techniques. We demonstrate the model's capabilities across two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation. The model excels at generating new circuits and supports typical DM extensions such as masking and editing to, for instance, align the circuit generation to the constraints of the targeted quantum device. Given their flexibility and generalization abilities, we envision DMs as pivotal in quantum circuit synthesis, enhancing both practical applications but also insights into theoretical quantum computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam R. Klivans, Konstantinos Stavropoulos, Arsen Vasilyan</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit the fundamental problem of learning with distribution shift, in which a learner is given labeled samples from training distribution $D$, unlabeled samples from test distribution $D'$ and is asked to output a classifier with low test error. The standard approach in this setting is to bound the loss of a classifier in terms of some notion of distance between $D$ and $D'$. These distances, however, seem difficult to compute and do not lead to efficient algorithms.
  We depart from this paradigm and define a new model called testable learning with distribution shift, where we can obtain provably efficient algorithms for certifying the performance of a classifier on a test distribution. In this model, a learner outputs a classifier with low test error whenever samples from $D$ and $D'$ pass an associated test; moreover, the test must accept if the marginal of $D$ equals the marginal of $D'$. We give several positive results for learning well-studied concept classes such as halfspaces, intersections of halfspaces, and decision trees when the marginal of $D$ is Gaussian or uniform on $\{\pm 1\}^d$. Prior to our work, no efficient algorithms for these basic cases were known without strong assumptions on $D'$.
  For halfspaces in the realizable case (where there exists a halfspace consistent with both $D$ and $D'$), we combine a moment-matching approach with ideas from active learning to simulate an efficient oracle for estimating disagreement regions. To extend to the non-realizable setting, we apply recent work from testable (agnostic) learning. More generally, we prove that any function class with low-degree $L_2$-sandwiching polynomial approximators can be learned in our model. We apply constructions from the pseudorandomness literature to obtain the required approximators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Zheng, Shengjie Qiu, Qianli Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) has been a long-standing problem in both vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. In recent years, as Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various NLP downstream tasks, utilizing PLMs as backbones has become a common practice in recent research of IL in NLP. Most assume that catastrophic forgetting is the biggest obstacle to achieving superior IL performance and propose various techniques to overcome this issue. However, we find that this assumption is problematic. Specifically, we revisit more than 20 methods on four classification tasks (Text Classification, Intent Classification, Relation Extraction, and Named Entity Recognition) under the two most popular IL settings (Class-Incremental and Task-Incremental) and reveal that most of them severely underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting ability of PLMs. Based on the observation, we propose a frustratingly easy method called SEQ* for IL with PLMs. The results show that SEQ* has competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL methods and requires considerably less trainable parameters and training time. These findings urge us to revisit the IL with PLMs and encourage future studies to have a fundamental understanding of the catastrophic forgetting in PLMs. The data, code and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/codebase-for-incremental-learning-with-llm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Combining complementary sensor modalities is crucial to providing robust perception for safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving (AD). Recent state-of-the-art camera-lidar fusion methods for AD rely on monocular depth estimation which is a notoriously difficult task compared to using depth information from the lidar directly. Here, we find that this approach does not leverage depth as expected and show that naively improving depth estimation does not lead to improvements in object detection performance. Strikingly, we also find that removing depth estimation altogether does not degrade object detection performance substantially, suggesting that relying on monocular depth could be an unnecessary architectural bottleneck during camera-lidar fusion. In this work, we introduce a novel fusion method that bypasses monocular depth estimation altogether and instead selects and fuses camera and lidar features in a bird's-eye-view grid using a simple attention mechanism. We show that our model can modulate its use of camera features based on the availability of lidar features and that it yields better 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset than baselines relying on monocular depth estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly crucial. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages from the pre-training corpus. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples integrated in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in multiple languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that diversifying the instruction tuning set with even just 2-4 languages significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual instruction-responses.</p>

We present a method to learn an automaton representation of a strategy using a modification of the L*-algorithm. Compared to the tabular representation of a strategy, the resulting automaton is dramatically smaller and thus also more explainable. Moreover, in the learning process, our heuristics may even improve the strategy's performance. In contrast to approaches that synthesize an automaton directly from the POMDP thereby solving it, our approach is incomparably more scalable.</p>

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tairan He, Chong Zhang, Wenli Xiao, Guanqi He, Changliu Liu, Guanya Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Legged robots navigating cluttered environments must be jointly agile for efficient task execution and safe to avoid collisions with obstacles or humans. Existing studies either develop conservative controllers (< 1.0 m/s) to ensure safety, or focus on agility without considering potentially fatal collisions. This paper introduces Agile But Safe (ABS), a learning-based control framework that enables agile and collision-free locomotion for quadrupedal robots. ABS involves an agile policy to execute agile motor skills amidst obstacles and a recovery policy to prevent failures, collaboratively achieving high-speed and collision-free navigation. The policy switch in ABS is governed by a learned control-theoretic reach-avoid value network, which also guides the recovery policy as an objective function, thereby safeguarding the robot in a closed loop. The training process involves the learning of the agile policy, the reach-avoid value network, the recovery policy, and an exteroception representation network, all in simulation. These trained modules can be directly deployed in the real world with onboard sensing and computation, leading to high-speed and collision-free navigation in confined indoor and outdoor spaces with both static and dynamic obstacles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaghayegh Sadeghi, Alan Bui, Ali Forooghi, Jianguo Lu, Alioune Ngom</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from OpenAI and LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Meta AI are increasingly recognized for their potential in the field of cheminformatics, particularly in understanding Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES), a standard method for representing chemical structures. These LLMs also have the ability to decode SMILES strings into vector representations.
  Method: We investigate the performance of GPT and LLaMA compared to pre-trained models on SMILES in embedding SMILES strings on downstream tasks, focusing on two key applications: molecular property prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction.
  Results: We find that SMILES embeddings generated using LLaMA outperform those from GPT in both molecular property and DDI prediction tasks. Notably, LLaMA-based SMILES embeddings show results comparable to pre-trained models on SMILES in molecular prediction tasks and outperform the pre-trained models for the DDI prediction tasks.
  Conclusion: The performance of LLMs in generating SMILES embeddings shows great potential for further investigation of these models for molecular embedding. We hope our study bridges the gap between LLMs and molecular embedding, motivating additional research into the potential of LLMs in the molecular representation field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Qadri, Kevin Zhang, Akshay Hinduja, Michael Kaess, Adithya Pediredla, Christopher A. Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater perception and 3D surface reconstruction are challenging problems with broad applications in construction, security, marine archaeology, and environmental monitoring. Treacherous operating conditions, fragile surroundings, and limited navigation control often dictate that submersibles restrict their range of motion and, thus, the baseline over which they can capture measurements. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction, it is well-known that smaller baselines make reconstruction more challenging. Our work develops a physics-based multimodal acoustic-optical neural surface reconstruction framework (AONeuS) capable of effectively integrating high-resolution RGB measurements with low-resolution depth-resolved imaging sonar measurements. By fusing these complementary modalities, our framework can reconstruct accurate high-resolution 3D surfaces from measurements captured over heavily-restricted baselines. Through extensive simulations and in-lab experiments, we demonstrate that AONeuS dramatically outperforms recent RGB-only and sonar-only inverse-differentiable-rendering--based surface reconstruction methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Schimanski, Jingwei Ni, Mathias Kraus, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances towards more faithful and traceable answers of Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for various research and practical endeavors. One avenue in reaching this goal is basing the answers on reliable sources. However, this Evidence-Based QA has proven to work insufficiently with LLMs in terms of citing the correct sources (source quality) and truthfully representing the information within sources (answer attributability). In this work, we systematically investigate how to robustly fine-tune LLMs for better source quality and answer attributability. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline with automated data quality filters, which can synthesize diversified high-quality training and testing data at scale. We further introduce four test sets to benchmark the robustness of fine-tuned specialist models. Extensive evaluation shows that fine-tuning on synthetic data improves performance on both in- and out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we show that data quality, which can be drastically improved by proposed quality filters, matters more than quantity in improving Evidence-Based QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingying Wang, Yun Xiong, Xixi Wu, Xiangguo Sun, Jiawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interaction adverse events, so-called DDI events, is increasingly valuable as it facilitates the study of mechanisms underlying drug use or adverse reactions. Existing models often neglect the distinctive characteristics of individual event classes when integrating multi-source features, which contributes to systematic unfairness when dealing with highly imbalanced event samples. Moreover, the limited capacity of these models to abstract the unique attributes of each event subclass considerably hampers their application in predicting rare drug-drug interaction events with a limited sample size. Reducing dataset bias and abstracting event subclass characteristics are two unresolved challenges. Recently, prompt tuning with frozen pre-trained graph models, namely "pre-train, prompt, fine-tune" strategy, has demonstrated impressive performance in few-shot tasks. Motivated by this, we propose DDIPrompt as a solution to address these aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our proposed approach entails a hierarchical pre-training task that aims to capture crucial aspects of drug molecular structure and intermolecular interactions while effectively mitigating implicit dataset bias within the node embeddings. Furthermore, we construct a prototypical graph by strategically sampling data from distinct event types and design subgraph prompts utilizing pre-trained node features. Through comprehensive benchmark experiments, we validate the efficacy of our subgraph prompts in accurately representing event classes and achieve exemplary results in both overall and subclass prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Hojny, Shiqiang Zhang, Juan S. Campos, Ruth Misener</p>
<p>Abstract: Since graph neural networks (GNNs) are often vulnerable to attack, we need to know when we can trust them. We develop a computationally effective approach towards providing robust certificates for message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) using a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. Because our work builds on mixed-integer optimization, it encodes a wide variety of subproblems, for example it admits (i) both adding and removing edges, (ii) both global and local budgets, and (iii) both topological perturbations and feature modifications. Our key technology, topology-based bounds tightening, uses graph structure to tighten bounds. We also experiment with aggressive bounds tightening to dynamically change the optimization constraints by tightening variable bounds. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, we implement an extension to the open-source branch-and-cut solver SCIP. We test on both node and graph classification problems and consider topological attacks that both add and remove edges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Jing Li, Haoran Xie, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality sentence embeddings are fundamental in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as semantic textual similarity (STS) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, most existing methods leverage fixed-length embeddings from full-layer language models, which lack the scalability to accommodate the diverse available resources across various applications. Viewing this gap, we propose a novel sentence embedding model $\mathrm{Espresso}$ $\mathrm{Sentence}$ $\mathrm{Embeddings}$ (ESE) with two learning processes. First, the learn-to-express process encodes more salient representations to lower layers. Second, the learn-to-compress process compacts essential features into the initial dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This way, ESE can scale model depth via the former process and embedding size via the latter. Extensive experiments on STS and RAG suggest that ESE can effectively produce high-quality embeddings with less model depth and embedding size, enhancing embedding inference efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Nazhat Abdullah, Tarkan Aydin</p>
<p>Abstract: The attention mechanism is the main component of the transformer architecture, and since its introduction, it has led to significant advancements in deep learning that span many domains and multiple tasks. The attention mechanism was utilized in computer vision as the Vision Transformer ViT, and its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While this mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the drawback of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block that reduces the compute burdens by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure that enhances the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic system of learning an element-wise gating function by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Huang, Ruize Gao, Bogdan Cautis, Xiaokui Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of continuous-time information diffusion has been an important area of research for many applications in recent years. When only the diffusion traces (cascades) are accessible, cascade-based network inference and influence estimation are two essential problems to explore. Alas, existing methods exhibit limited capability to infer and process networks with more than a few thousand nodes, suffering from scalability issues. In this paper, we view the diffusion process as a continuous-time dynamical system, based on which we establish a continuous-time diffusion model. Subsequently, we instantiate the model to a scalable and effective framework (FIM) to approximate the diffusion propagation from available cascades, thereby inferring the underlying network structure. Furthermore, we undertake an analysis of the approximation error of FIM for network inference. To achieve the desired scalability for influence estimation, we devise an advanced sampling technique and significantly boost the efficiency. We also quantify the effect of the approximation error on influence estimation theoretically. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness and superior scalability of FIM on network inference and influence estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jensen Gao, Annie Xie, Ted Xiao, Chelsea Finn, Dorsa Sadigh</p>
<p>Abstract: Data collection has become an increasingly important problem in robotic manipulation, yet there still lacks much understanding of how to effectively collect data to facilitate broad generalization. Recent works on large-scale robotic data collection typically vary many environmental factors of variation (e.g., object types, table textures) during data collection, to cover a diverse range of scenarios. However, they do not explicitly account for the possible compositional abilities of policies trained on the data. If robot policies can compose environmental factors from their data to succeed when encountering unseen factor combinations, we can exploit this to avoid collecting data for situations that composition would address. To investigate this possibility, we conduct thorough empirical studies both in simulation and on a real robot that compare data collection strategies and assess whether visual imitation learning policies can compose environmental factors. We find that policies do exhibit composition, although leveraging prior robotic datasets is critical for this on a real robot. We use these insights to propose better in-domain data collection strategies that exploit composition, which can induce better generalization than naive approaches for the same amount of effort during data collection. We further demonstrate that a real robot policy trained on data from such a strategy achieves a success rate of 77.5% when transferred to entirely new environments that encompass unseen combinations of environmental factors, whereas policies trained using data collected without accounting for environmental variation fail to transfer effectively, with a success rate of only 2.5%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Zhu, Sining Sun, Changhao Shan, Peng Fan, Qing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformer-based attention models have become the de facto backbone model for Automatic Speech Recognition tasks. A blank symbol is usually introduced to align the input and output sequences for CTC or RNN-T models. Unfortunately, the long input length overloads computational budget and memory consumption quadratically by attention mechanism. In this work, we propose a "Skip-and-Recover" Conformer architecture, named Skipformer, to squeeze sequence input length dynamically and inhomogeneously. Skipformer uses an intermediate CTC output as criteria to split frames into three groups: crucial, skipping and ignoring. The crucial group feeds into next conformer blocks and its output joint with skipping group by original temporal order as the final encoder output. Experiments show that our model reduces the input sequence length by 31 times on Aishell-1 and 22 times on Librispeech corpus. Meanwhile, the model can achieve better recognition accuracy and faster inference speed than recent baseline models. Our code is open-sourced and available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Liu, Kangning Zhang, Xiangyuan Ren, Yanhua Huang, Jiarui Jin, Yingjie Qin, Ruilong Su, Ruiwen Xu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of multimedia applications, multimodal recommendations play an essential role, as they can leverage rich contexts beyond user and item interactions. Existing methods mainly use them to help learn ID features; however, there exist semantic gaps among multimodal content features and ID features. Directly using multimodal information as an auxiliary would lead to misalignment in items' and users' representations. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the misalignment issue in multimodal recommendations, and propose a solution named AlignRec. In AlignRec, the recommendation objective is decomposed into three alignments, namely alignment within contents, alignment between content and categorical ID, and alignment between users and items. Each alignment is characterized by a distinct objective function. To effectively train AlignRec, we propose starting from pre-training the first alignment to obtain unified multimodal features and subsequently training the following two alignments together. As it is essential to analyze whether each multimodal feature helps in training, we design three new classes of metrics to evaluate intermediate performance. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently verify the superiority of AlignRec compared to nine baselines. We also find that the multimodal features generated by our framework are better than currently used ones, which are to be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Sigillo, Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni, Alessandro Nicolosi, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in the field of image generation, primarily driven by the escalating demand for high-quality outcomes across various image generation subtasks, such as inpainting, denoising, and super resolution. A major effort is devoted to exploring the application of super-resolution techniques to enhance the quality of low-resolution images. In this context, our method explores in depth the problem of ship image super resolution, which is crucial for coastal and port surveillance. We investigate the opportunity given by the growing interest in text-to-image diffusion models, taking advantage of the prior knowledge that such foundation models have already learned. In particular, we present a diffusion-model-based architecture that leverages text conditioning during training while being class-aware, to best preserve the crucial details of the ships during the generation of the super-resoluted image. Since the specificity of this task and the scarcity availability of off-the-shelf data, we also introduce a large labeled ship dataset scraped from online ship images, mostly from ShipSpotting\footnote{\url{www.shipspotting.com}} website. Our method achieves more robust results than other deep learning models previously employed for super resolution, as proven by the multiple experiments performed. Moreover, we investigate how this model can benefit downstream tasks, such as classification and object detection, thus emphasizing practical implementation in a real-world scenario. Experimental results show flexibility, reliability, and impressive performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods for different tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam R. Klivans, Konstantinos Stavropoulos, Arsen Vasilyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work of Klivans, Stavropoulos, and Vasilyan initiated the study of testable learning with distribution shift (TDS learning), where a learner is given labeled samples from training distribution $\mathcal{D}$, unlabeled samples from test distribution $\mathcal{D}'$, and the goal is to output a classifier with low error on $\mathcal{D}'$ whenever the training samples pass a corresponding test. Their model deviates from all prior work in that no assumptions are made on $\mathcal{D}'$. Instead, the test must accept (with high probability) when the marginals of the training and test distributions are equal.
  Here we focus on the fundamental case of intersections of halfspaces with respect to Gaussian training distributions and prove a variety of new upper bounds including a $2^{(k/\epsilon)^{O(1)}} \mathsf{poly}(d)$-time algorithm for TDS learning intersections of $k$ homogeneous halfspaces to accuracy $\epsilon$ (prior work achieved $d^{(k/\epsilon)^{O(1)}}$). We work under the mild assumption that the Gaussian training distribution contains at least an $\epsilon$ fraction of both positive and negative examples ($\epsilon$-balanced). We also prove the first set of SQ lower-bounds for any TDS learning problem and show (1) the $\epsilon$-balanced assumption is necessary for $\mathsf{poly}(d,1/\epsilon)$-time TDS learning for a single halfspace and (2) a $d^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log 1/\epsilon)}$ lower bound for the intersection of two general halfspaces, even with the $\epsilon$-balanced assumption.
  Our techniques significantly expand the toolkit for TDS learning. We use dimension reduction and coverings to give efficient algorithms for computing a localized version of discrepancy distance, a key metric from the domain adaptation literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Answering real-world complex queries, such as complex product search, often requires accurate retrieval from semi-structured knowledge bases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, previous works have mostly studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational K nowledge Bases. Our benchmark covers three domains/datasets: product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, together with their ground-truth answers (items). We conduct rigorous human evaluation to validate the quality of our synthesized queries. We further enhance the benchmark with high-quality human-generated queries to provide an authentic reference. STARK serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that STARK presents significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, indicating the demand for building more capable retrieval systems.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently discussed in academia and the general public as support tools for virtually any use case that relies on the production of text, including software engineering. Currently there is much debate, but little empirical evidence, regarding the practical usefulness of LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT for engineers in industry. We conduct an observational study of 24 professional software engineers who have been using ChatGPT over a period of one week in their jobs, and qualitatively analyse their dialogues with the chatbot as well as their overall experience (as captured by an exit survey). We find that, rather than expecting ChatGPT to generate ready-to-use software artifacts (e.g., code), practitioners more often use ChatGPT to receive guidance on how to solve their tasks or learn about a topic in more abstract terms. We also propose a theoretical framework for how (i) purpose of the interaction, (ii) internal factors (e.g., the user's personality), and (iii) external factors (e.g., company policy) together shape the experience (in terms of perceived usefulness and trust). We envision that our framework can be used by future research to further the academic discussion on LLM usage by software engineering practitioners, and to serve as a reference point for the design of future empirical LLM research in this domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the RetinaRegNet model, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various retinal image registration tasks. RetinaRegNet does not require training on any retinal images. It begins by establishing point correspondences between two retinal images using image features derived from diffusion models. This process involves the selection of feature points from the moving image using the SIFT algorithm alongside random point sampling. For each selected feature point, a 2D correlation map is computed by assessing the similarity between the feature vector at that point and the feature vectors of all pixels in the fixed image. The pixel with the highest similarity score in the correlation map corresponds to the feature point in the moving image. To remove outliers in the estimated point correspondences, we first applied an inverse consistency constraint, followed by a transformation-based outlier detector. This method proved to outperform the widely used random sample consensus (RANSAC) outlier detector by a significant margin. To handle large deformations, we utilized a two-stage image registration framework. A homography transformation was used in the first stage and a more accurate third-order polynomial transformation was used in the second stage. The model's effectiveness was demonstrated across three retinal image datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. RetinaRegNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in all three datasets. It was especially effective for registering image pairs with large displacement and scaling deformations. This innovation holds promise for various applications in retinal image analysis. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nian Liu, Shen Fan, Ting Bai, Peng Wang, Mingwei Sun, Yanhu Mo, Xiaoxiao Xu, Hong Liu, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem. However, raw social relations don't always benefit recommendation due to their inferior quality and insufficient quantity, especially for inactive users, whose interacted items are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called LSIR (\textbf{L}earning \textbf{S}ocial Graph for \textbf{I}nactive User \textbf{R}ecommendation) that learns an optimal social graph structure for social recommendation, especially for inactive users. LSIR recursively aggregates user and item embeddings to collaboratively encode item and user features. Then, graph structure learning (GSL) is employed to refine the raw user-user social graph, by removing noisy edges and adding new edges based on the enhanced embeddings. Meanwhile, mimic learning is implemented to guide active users in mimicking inactive users during model training, which improves the construction of new edges for inactive users. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LSIR achieves significant improvements of up to 129.58\% on NDCG in inactive user recommendation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jake Roth, Ying Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Superquantiles have recently gained significant interest as a risk-aware metric for addressing fairness and distribution shifts in statistical learning and decision making problems. This paper introduces a fast, scalable and robust second-order computational framework to solve large-scale optimization problems with superquantile-based constraints. Unlike empirical risk minimization, superquantile-based optimization requires ranking random functions evaluated across all scenarios to compute the tail conditional expectation. While this tail-based feature might seem computationally unfriendly, it provides an advantageous setting for a semismooth-Newton-based augmented Lagrangian method. The superquantile operator effectively reduces the dimensions of the Newton systems since the tail expectation involves considerably fewer scenarios. Notably, the extra cost of obtaining relevant second-order information and performing matrix inversions is often comparable to, and sometimes even less than, the effort required for gradient computation. Our developed solver is particularly effective when the number of scenarios substantially exceeds the number of decision variables. In synthetic problems with linear and convex diagonal quadratic objectives, numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by a large margin: It achieves speeds more than 750 times faster for linear and quadratic objectives than the alternating direction method of multipliers as implemented by OSQP for computing low-accuracy solutions. Additionally, it is up to 25 times faster for linear objectives and 70 times faster for quadratic objectives than the commercial solver Gurobi, and 20 times faster for linear objectives and 30 times faster for quadratic objectives than the Portfolio Safeguard optimization suite for high-accuracy solution computations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xirui Peng, Qiming Xu, Zheng Feng, Haopeng Zhao, Lianghao Tan, Yan Zhou, Zecheng Zhang, Chenwei Gong, Yingqiao Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores an automatic news generation and fact-checking system based on language processing, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and quality of news production while ensuring the authenticity and reliability of the news content. With the rapid development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning technologies, automatic news generation systems are capable of extracting key information from massive data and generating well-structured, fluent news articles. Meanwhile, by integrating fact-checking technology, the system can effectively prevent the spread of false news and improve the accuracy and credibility of news. This study details the key technologies involved in automatic news generation and factchecking, including text generation, information extraction, and the application of knowledge graphs, and validates the effectiveness of these technologies through experiments. Additionally, the paper discusses the future development directions of automatic news generation and fact-checking systems, emphasizing the importance of further integration and innovation of technologies. The results show that with continuous technological optimization and practical application, these systems will play an increasingly important role in the future news industry, providing more efficient and reliable news services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Du, Lixin Xiu, Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii</p>
<p>Abstract: We apply an information-theoretic perspective to reconsider generative document retrieval (GDR), in which a document $x \in X$ is indexed by $t \in T$, and a neural autoregressive model is trained to map queries $Q$ to $T$. GDR can be considered to involve information transmission from documents $X$ to queries $Q$, with the requirement to transmit more bits via the indexes $T$. By applying Shannon's rate-distortion theory, the optimality of indexing can be analyzed in terms of the mutual information, and the design of the indexes $T$ can then be regarded as a {\em bottleneck} in GDR. After reformulating GDR from this perspective, we empirically quantify the bottleneck underlying GDR. Finally, using the NQ320K and MARCO datasets, we evaluate our proposed bottleneck-minimal indexing method in comparison with various previous indexing methods, and we show that it outperforms those methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Jiang, Yusen Wu, Junwu Xiong, Jingqing Ruan, Yichuan Ding, Qingpei Guo, Zujie Wen, Jun Zhou, Xiaotie Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for incorporating human preferences into pre-trained language models, playing a key role in the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, these datasets often demonstrate conflicting alignment objectives, leading to increased vulnerability to jailbreak attacks and challenges in adapting downstream tasks to prioritize specific alignment objectives without negatively impacting others. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical metric, Alignment Dimension Conflict, to quantify the degree of conflict within preference datasets. We then present \texttt{Hummer} and its fine-grained variant, \texttt{Hummer-F}, as innovative pairwise preference datasets with reduced-conflict alignment objectives. \texttt{Hummer} is built based on UltraFeedback and is enhanced by AI feedback from GPT-4, marking as the first preference dataset aimed at reducing the competition between alignment objectives. Furthermore, we develop reward models, HummerRM and HummerRM-F, which employ a hybrid sampling approach to balance diverse alignment objectives effectively. This sampling method positions HummerRM as an ideal model for domain-specific further fine-tuning and reducing vulnerabilities to attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Poesina, Cornelia Caragea, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography. Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Maor Lotan, Inbal Talgam-Cohen, Yaniv Romano</p>
<p>Abstract: Auctions are key for maximizing sellers' revenue and ensuring truthful bidding among buyers. Recently, an approach known as differentiable economics based on deep learning shows promise in learning optimal auction mechanisms for multiple items and participants. However, this approach has no guarantee of strategy-proofness at test time. Strategy-proofness is crucial as it ensures that buyers are incentivized to bid their true valuations, leading to optimal and fair auction outcomes without the risk of manipulation. Building on conformal prediction, we introduce a novel approach to achieve strategy-proofness with rigorous statistical guarantees. The key novelties of our method are: (i) the formulation of a regret prediction model, used to quantify at test time violations of strategy-proofness; and (ii) an auction acceptance rule that leverages the predicted regret to ensure that for a new auction, the data-driven mechanism meets the strategy-proofness requirement with high probability (e.g., 99\%). Numerical experiments demonstrate the necessity for rigorous guarantees, the validity of our theoretical results, and the applicability of our proposed method.</p>
