<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chu, Linjuan Rita Men, Sixiao Liu, Shupei Yuan, Yuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This study builds on person perception and human AI interaction (HAII) theories to investigate how content and source cues, specifically race, ethnicity, and nationality, affect judgments of AI-generated content in a high-stakes self-presentation context: college applications. Results of a pre-registered experiment with a nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 644) show that content heuristics, such as linguistic style, played a dominant role in AI detection. Source heuristics, such as nationality, also emerged as a significant factor, with international students more likely to be perceived as using AI, especially when their statements included AI-sounding features. Interestingly, Asian and Hispanic applicants were more likely to be judged as AI users when labeled as domestic students, suggesting interactions between racial stereotypes and AI detection. AI attribution led to lower perceptions of personal statement quality and authenticity, as well as negative evaluations of the applicant's competence, sociability, morality, and future success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have shown remarkable performance but remain largely opaque in their decision making processes. The interpretability of these models, especially their internal attention mechanisms, is critical for building trust and verifying that these systems behave as intended. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to quantitatively evaluate the explainability of an NMT model attention patterns by comparing them against statistical alignments and correlating them with standard machine translation quality metrics. We present a set of metrics attention entropy and alignment agreement and validate them on an English-German test subset from WMT14 using a pre trained mT5 model. Our results indicate that sharper attention distributions correlate with improved interpretability but do not always guarantee better translation quality. These findings advance our understanding of NMT explainability and guide future efforts toward building more transparent and reliable machine translation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan P\"otsch</p>
<p>Abstract: The EU AI Act (AIA) mandates the implementation of a risk management system (RMS) and a quality management system (QMS) for high-risk AI systems. The ISO/IEC 42001 standard provides a foundation for fulfilling these requirements but does not cover all EU-specific regulatory stipulations. To enhance the implementation of the AIA in Germany, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) could introduce the national standard BSI 200-5, which specifies AIA requirements and integrates existing ISMS standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001. This paper examines the interfaces between an information security management system (ISMS) and an AI management system (AIMS), demonstrating that incorporating existing ISMS controls with specific AI extensions presents an effective strategy for complying with Article 15 of the AIA. Four new AI modules are introduced, proposed for inclusion in the BSI IT Grundschutz framework to comprehensively ensure the security of AI systems. Additionally, an approach for adapting BSI's qualification and certification systems is outlined to ensure that expertise in secure AI handling is continuously developed. Finally, the paper discusses how the BSI could bridge international standards and the specific requirements of the AIA through the nationalization of ISO/IEC 42001, creating synergies and bolstering the competitiveness of the German AI landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Zhang, Ziyang Xiong, Shixuan Liu, Yutong Xie, Tolga Ergen, Dongsub Shim, Hua Xu, Honglak Lee, Qiaozhu Me</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-dimensional visualizations, or "projection maps" of datasets, are widely used across scientific research and creative industries as effective tools for interpreting large-scale and complex information. These visualizations not only support understanding existing knowledge spaces but are often used implicitly to guide exploration into unknown areas. While powerful methods like TSNE or UMAP can create such visual maps, there is currently no systematic way to leverage them for generating new content. To bridge this gap, we introduce Map2Text, a novel task that translates spatial coordinates within low-dimensional visualizations into new, coherent, and accurately aligned textual content. This allows users to explore and navigate undiscovered information embedded in these spatial layouts interactively and intuitively. To evaluate the performance of Map2Text methods, we propose Atometric, an evaluation metric that provides a granular assessment of logical coherence and alignment of the atomic statements in the generated texts. Experiments conducted across various datasets demonstrate the versatility of Map2Text in generating scientific research hypotheses, crafting synthetic personas, and devising strategies for testing large language models. Our findings highlight the potential of Map2Text to unlock new pathways for interacting with and navigating large-scale textual datasets, offering a novel framework for spatially guided content generation and discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Jiang, Xiaolei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The justice system has increasingly employed AI techniques to enhance efficiency, yet limitations remain in improving the quality of decision-making, particularly regarding transparency and explainability needed to uphold public trust in legal AI. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model based multi-agent framework named AgentsBench, which aims to simultaneously improve both efficiency and quality in judicial decision-making. Our approach leverages multiple LLM-driven agents that simulate the collaborative deliberation and decision making process of a judicial bench. We conducted experiments on legal judgment prediction task, and the results show that our framework outperforms existing LLM based methods in terms of performance and decision quality. By incorporating these elements, our framework reflects real-world judicial processes more closely, enhancing accuracy, fairness, and society consideration. AgentsBench provides a more nuanced and realistic methods of trustworthy AI decision-making, with strong potential for application across various case types and legal scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Chunked Augmented Generation (CAG), an architecture specifically designed to overcome the context window limitations of Google Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model. While Chrome's integration of Gemini Nano represents a significant advancement in bringing AI capabilities directly to the browser, its restricted context window poses challenges for processing large inputs. CAG addresses this limitation through intelligent input chunking and processing strategies, enabling efficient handling of extensive content while maintaining the model's performance within browser constraints. Our implementation demonstrates particular efficacy in processing large documents and datasets directly within Chrome, making sophisticated AI capabilities accessible through the browser without external API dependencies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueting Lin, Zhan Cheng, Longfei Yun, Qingyi Lu, Yuanshuai Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of the information explosion era, the importance of recommendation systems in various applications is increasingly significant. Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms are widely used due to their effectiveness in capturing user behavior patterns, but they encounter limitations when dealing with cold start problems and data sparsity. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities, provide a new breakthrough for recommendation systems. This study proposes an enhanced recommendation method that combines collaborative filtering and LLMs, aiming to leverage collaborative filtering's advantage in modeling user preferences while enhancing the understanding of textual information about users and items through LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity. This paper first introduces the fundamental theories of collaborative filtering and LLMs, then designs a recommendation system architecture that integrates both, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments. The results show that the hybrid model based on collaborative filtering and LLMs significantly improves precision, recall, and user satisfaction, demonstrating its potential in complex recommendation scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18715">Optimization and Scalability of Collaborative Filtering Algorithms in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Yang, Longfei Yun, Jinghan Cao, Qingyi Lu, Yuming Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and the growing demand for personalized content, recommendation systems have become critical in enhancing user experience and driving engagement. Collaborative filtering algorithms, being core to many recommendation systems, have garnered significant attention for their efficiency and interpretability. However, traditional collaborative filtering approaches face numerous challenges when integrated into large-scale LLM-based systems, including high computational costs, severe data sparsity, cold start problems, and lack of scalability. This paper investigates the optimization and scalability of collaborative filtering algorithms in large language models, addressing these limitations through advanced optimization strategies. Firstly, we analyze the fundamental principles of collaborative filtering algorithms and their limitations when applied in LLM-based contexts. Next, several optimization techniques such as matrix factorization, approximate nearest neighbor search, and parallel computing are proposed to enhance computational efficiency and model accuracy. Additionally, strategies such as distributed architecture and model compression are explored to facilitate dynamic updates and scalability in data-intensive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Riyadh, Muqi Li, Felix Haryanto Lie, Jia Long Loh, Haotian Mi, Sayam Bohra</p>
<p>Abstract: As data retrieval demands become increasingly complex, traditional search methods often fall short in addressing nuanced and conceptual queries. Vector similarity search has emerged as a promising technique for finding semantically similar information efficiently. However, its effectiveness diminishes when handling intricate queries with contextual nuances. This paper explores a hybrid approach combining vector similarity search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The proposed two-step solution first employs vector similarity search to shortlist potential matches, followed by an LLM for context-aware ranking of the results. Experiments on structured datasets demonstrate that while vector similarity search alone performs well for straightforward queries, the LLM-assisted approach excels in processing complex queries involving constraints, negations, or conceptual requirements. By leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, this method improves the accuracy of search results for complex tasks without sacrificing efficiency. We also discuss real-world applications and propose directions for future research to refine and scale this technique for diverse datasets and use cases.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18890">CoEvo: Continual Evolution of Symbolic Solutions Using Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Guo, Qingfu Zhang, Xi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in artificial intelligence, capable of processing and understanding extensive human knowledge to enhance problem-solving across various domains. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to drive the discovery of symbolic solutions within scientific and engineering disciplines, where such solutions are crucial for advancing theoretical and practical applications. We propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs in an evolutionary search methodology, augmented by a dynamic knowledge library that integrates and refines insights in an \textit{open-ended manner}. This approach aims to tackle the dual challenges of efficiently navigating complex symbolic representation spaces and leveraging both existing and newly generated knowledge to foster open-ended innovation. By enabling LLMs to interact with and expand upon a knowledge library, we facilitate the continuous generation of novel solutions in diverse forms such as language, code, and mathematical expressions. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative process, marking a significant step towards harnessing AI in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines whether collective reasoning among generative agents can facilitate novel and coherent thinking that leads to innovation. To achieve this, it proposes GAI, a new LLM-empowered framework designed for reflection and interaction among multiple generative agents to replicate the process of innovation. The core of the GAI framework lies in an architecture that dynamically processes the internal states of agents and a dialogue scheme specifically tailored to facilitate analogy-driven innovation. The framework's functionality is evaluated using Dyson's invention of the bladeless fan as a case study, assessing the extent to which the core ideas of the innovation can be replicated through a set of fictional technical documents. The experimental results demonstrate that models with internal states significantly outperformed those without, achieving higher average scores and lower variance. Notably, the model with five heterogeneous agents equipped with internal states successfully replicated the key ideas underlying the Dyson's invention. This indicates that the internal state enables agents to refine their ideas, resulting in the construction and sharing of more coherent and comprehensive concepts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18907">EC-Diffuser: Multi-Object Manipulation via Entity-Centric Behavior Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Carl Qi, Dan Haramati, Tal Daniel, Aviv Tamar, Amy Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object manipulation is a common component of everyday tasks, but learning to manipulate objects from high-dimensional observations presents significant challenges. These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to the combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired behaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to train models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through scaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen object configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that leverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with diffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image data. Our method first decomposes observations into an object-centric representation, which is then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that computes attention at the object level, simultaneously predicting object dynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models to capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial performance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables compositional generalization. We present BC agents capable of zero-shot generalization to tasks with novel compositions of objects and goals, including larger numbers of objects than seen during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Situo Zhang, Hankun Wang, Da Ma, Zichen Zhu, Lu Chen, Kunyao Lan, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a popular lossless technique for accelerating the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that the decoding speed of SD frameworks with static draft structures can be significantly improved by incorporating context-aware adaptive draft structures. However, current studies on adaptive draft structures are limited by their performance, modeling approaches, and applicability. In this paper, we introduce AdaEAGLE, the first SD framework that explicitly models adaptive draft structures. AdaEAGLE leverages the Lightweight Draft Length Predictor (LDLP) module to explicitly predict the optimal number of draft tokens during inference to guide the draft model. It achieves comparable speedup results without manual thresholds and allows for deeper, more specialized optimizations. Moreover, together with threshold-based strategies, AdaEAGLE achieves a $1.62\times$ speedup over the vanilla AR decoding and outperforms fixed-length SotA baseline while maintaining output quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-range tasks require reasoning over long inputs. Existing solutions either need large compute budgets, training data, access to model weights, or use complex, task-specific approaches. We present PRISM, which alleviates these concerns by processing information as a stream of chunks, maintaining a structured in-context memory specified by a typed hierarchy schema. This approach demonstrates superior performance to baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x smaller contexts than long-context models. Moreover, PRISM is token-efficient. By producing short outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches, it achieves up to 54% cost reduction when compared to alternative short-context approaches. The method also scales down to tiny information chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) without increasing the number of tokens encoded or sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generate schemas to generalize our approach to new tasks with minimal effort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Noyman, Kai Hu, Kent Larson</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human behavior in built environments is critical for designing functional, user centered urban spaces. Traditional approaches, such as manual observations, surveys, and simplified simulations, often fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of real world behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce TravelAgent, a novel simulation platform that models pedestrian navigation and activity patterns across diverse indoor and outdoor environments under varying contextual and environmental conditions. TravelAgent leverages generative agents integrated into 3D virtual environments, enabling agents to process multimodal sensory inputs and exhibit human-like decision-making, behavior, and adaptation. Through experiments, including navigation, wayfinding, and free exploration, we analyze data from 100 simulations comprising 1898 agent steps across diverse spatial layouts and agent archetypes, achieving an overall task completion rate of 76%. Using spatial, linguistic, and sentiment analyses, we show how agents perceive, adapt to, or struggle with their surroundings and assigned tasks. Our findings highlight the potential of TravelAgent as a tool for urban design, spatial cognition research, and agent-based modeling. We discuss key challenges and opportunities in deploying generative agents for the evaluation and refinement of spatial designs, proposing TravelAgent as a new paradigm for simulating and understanding human experiences in built environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: What is appropriateness? Humans navigate a multi-scale mosaic of interlocking notions of what is appropriate for different situations. We act one way with our friends, another with our family, and yet another in the office. Likewise for AI, appropriate behavior for a comedy-writing assistant is not the same as appropriate behavior for a customer-service representative. What determines which actions are appropriate in which contexts? And what causes these standards to change over time? Since all judgments of AI appropriateness are ultimately made by humans, we need to understand how appropriateness guides human decision making in order to properly evaluate AI decision making and improve it. This paper presents a theory of appropriateness: how it functions in human society, how it may be implemented in the brain, and what it means for responsible deployment of generative AI technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghong He, Chao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time bidding (RTB) plays a pivotal role in online advertising ecosystems. Advertisers employ strategic bidding to optimize their advertising impact while adhering to various financial constraints, such as the return-on-investment (ROI) and cost-per-click (CPC). Primarily focusing on bidding with fixed budget constraints, traditional approaches cannot effectively manage the dynamic budget allocation problem where the goal is to achieve global optimization of bidding performance across multiple channels with a shared budget. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for multi-channel bidding optimization. In this framework, the top-level strategy applies a CPC constrained diffusion model to dynamically allocate budgets among the channels according to their distinct features and complex interdependencies, while the bottom-level strategy adopts a state-action decoupled actor-critic method to address the problem of extrapolation errors in offline learning caused by out-of-distribution actions and a context-based meta-channel knowledge learning method to improve the state representation capability of the policy based on the shared knowledge among different channels. Comprehensive experiments conducted on a large scale real-world industrial dataset from the Meituan ad bidding platform demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoping Hu, Zongyuan Huang, Jinming Yang, Tao Yang, Yaohui Jin, Yanyan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Baheti, Debanjana Chakraborty, Faeze Brahman, Ronan Le Bras, Ximing Lu, Nouha Dziri, Yejin Choi, Mark Riedl, Maarten Sap</p>
<p>Abstract: Obeying precise constraints on top of multiple external attributes is a common computational problem underlying seemingly different domains, from controlled text generation to protein engineering. Existing language model (LM) controllability methods for multi-attribute constraint satisfaction often rely on specialized architectures or gradient-based classifiers, limiting their flexibility to work with arbitrary black-box evaluators and pretrained models. Current general-purpose large language models, while capable, cannot achieve fine-grained multi-attribute control over external attributes. Thus, we create Multi-Attribute Constraint Satisfaction (MACS), a generalized method capable of finetuning language models on any sequential domain to satisfy user-specified constraints on multiple external real-value attributes. Our method trains LMs as editors by sampling diverse multi-attribute edit pairs from an initial set of paraphrased outputs. During inference, LM iteratively improves upon its previous solution to satisfy constraints for all attributes by leveraging our designed constraint satisfaction reward. We additionally experiment with reward-weighted behavior cloning to further improve the constraint satisfaction rate of LMs. To evaluate our approach, we present a new Fine-grained Constraint Satisfaction (FineCS) benchmark, featuring two challenging tasks: (1) Text Style Transfer, where the goal is to simultaneously modify the sentiment and complexity of reviews, and (2) Protein Design, focusing on modulating fluorescence and stability of Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP). Our empirical results show that MACS achieves the highest threshold satisfaction in both FineCS tasks, outperforming strong domain-specific baselines. Our work opens new avenues for generalized and real-value multi-attribute control, with implications for diverse applications spanning NLP and bioinformatics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shamik Bhattacharjee, Kamlesh Marathe, Hitesh Kapoor, Nilesh Patil</p>
<p>Abstract: Fantasy sports, particularly fantasy cricket, have garnered immense popularity in India in recent years, offering enthusiasts the opportunity to engage in strategic team-building and compete based on the real-world performance of professional athletes. In this paper, we address the challenge of optimizing fantasy cricket team selection using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. By framing the team creation process as a sequential decision-making problem, we aim to develop a model that can adaptively select players to maximize the team's potential performance. Our approach leverages historical player data to train RL algorithms, which then predict future performance and optimize team composition. This not only represents a huge business opportunity by enabling more accurate predictions of high-performing teams but also enhances the overall user experience. Through empirical evaluation and comparison with traditional fantasy team drafting methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in constructing competitive fantasy teams. Our results show that RL-based strategies provide valuable insights into player selection in fantasy sports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abeer Badawi, Somayya Elmoghazy, Samira Choudhury, Khalid Elgazzar, Amer Burhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder that has been growing among elder people over the past decades. This growth profoundly impacts the quality of life for patients and caregivers due to the symptoms arising from it. Agitation and aggression (AA) are some of the symptoms of people with severe dementia (PwD) in long-term care or hospitals. AA not only causes discomfort but also puts the patients or others at potential risk. Existing monitoring solutions utilizing different wearable sensors integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer a way to detect AA early enough for timely and adequate medical intervention. However, most studies are limited by the availability of accurately labeled datasets, which significantly affects the efficacy of such solutions in real-world scenarios. This study presents a novel comprehensive approach to detect AA in PwD using physiological data from the Empatica E4 wristbands. The research creates a diverse dataset, consisting of three distinct datasets gathered from 14 participants across multiple hospitals in Canada. These datasets have not been extensively explored due to their limited labeling. We propose a novel approach employing self-training and a variational autoencoder (VAE) to detect AA in PwD effectively. The proposed approach aims to learn the representation of the features extracted using the VAE and then uses a semi-supervised block to generate labels, classify events, and detect AA. We demonstrate that combining Self-Training and Variational Autoencoder mechanism significantly improves model performance in classifying AA in PwD. Among the tested techniques, the XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 90.16\%. By effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeled data, the proposed system not only learns new labels but also proves its superiority in detecting AA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Risal Shahriar Shefin, Md Asifur Rahman, Thai Le, Sarra Alqahtani</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in simulated environments, such as games, where failures have minimal consequences. However, the deployment of RL agents in real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, UAVs, and medical devices demands a higher level of safety and transparency, particularly when facing adversarial threats. Safe RL algorithms have been developed to address these concerns by optimizing both task performance and safety constraints. However, errors are inevitable, and when they occur, it is essential that the RL agents can also explain their actions to human operators. This makes trust in the safety mechanisms of RL systems crucial for effective deployment. Explainability plays a key role in building this trust by providing clear, actionable insights into the agent's decision-making process, ensuring that safety-critical decisions are well understood. While machine learning (ML) has seen significant advances in interpretability and visualization, explainability methods for RL remain limited. Current tools fail to address the dynamic, sequential nature of RL and its needs to balance task performance with safety constraints over time. The re-purposing of traditional ML methods, such as saliency maps, is inadequate for safety-critical RL applications where mistakes can result in severe consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose xSRL, a framework that integrates both local and global explanations to provide a comprehensive understanding of RL agents' behavior. xSRL also enables developers to identify policy vulnerabilities through adversarial attacks, offering tools to debug and patch agents without retraining. Our experiments and user studies demonstrate xSRL's effectiveness in increasing safety in RL systems, making them more reliable and trustworthy for real-world deployment.

<p>Abstract: The optimization on the structure of process of information management under uncertain environment has attracted lots of attention from researchers around the world. Nevertheless, how to obtain accurate and rational evaluation from assessments produced by experts is still an open problem. Specially, intuitionistic fuzzy set provides an effective solution in handling indeterminate information. And Yager proposes a novel method for fusion of probabilistic evidence to handle uncertain and conflicting information lately which is called soft likelihood function. This paper devises a novel framework of soft likelihood function based on information volume of fuzzy membership and credibility measure for extracting truly useful and valuable information from uncertainty. An application is provided to verify the validity and correctness of the proposed framework. Besides, the comparisons with other existing methods further demonstrate the superiority of the novel framework of soft likelihood function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxin Wang (Naveen Jindal School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas), Dennis J. Zhang (Olin School of Business, Washington University in St. Louis), Heng Zhang (W. P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9\% to 79.8\%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chathura Rajapakse, Wathsala Ariyarathna, Shanmugalingam Selvakan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates Sri Lankan ICT teachers' readiness to teach AI in schools, focusing on self-efficacy. A survey of over 1,300 teachers assessed their self-efficacy using a scale developed based on Bandura's theory. PLS-SEM analysis revealed that teachers' self-efficacy was low, primarily influenced by emotional and physiological states and imaginary experiences related to AI instruction. Mastery experiences had a lesser impact, and vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion showed no significant effect. The study highlights the need for a systemic approach to teacher professional development, considering the limitations in teachers' AI expertise and social capital. Further research is recommended to explore a socio-technical systems perspective for effective AI teacher training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Seungyoon Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions. This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions. However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs' capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the proposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the several strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaolong Ling, Honghui Peng, Yiwen Zhang, Peng Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Kui Yu, Xindong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Local causal discovery aims to learn and distinguish the direct causes and effects of a target variable from observed data. Existing constraint-based local causal discovery methods use AND or OR rules in constructing the local causal skeleton, but using either rule alone is prone to produce cascading errors in the learned local causal skeleton, and thus impacting the inference of local causal relationships. On the other hand, directly applying score-based global causal discovery methods to local causal discovery may randomly return incorrect results due to the existence of local equivalence classes. To address the above issues, we propose a Hybrid Local Causal Discovery algorithm, called HLCD. Specifically, HLCD initially utilizes a constraint-based approach combined with the OR rule to obtain a candidate skeleton and then employs a score-based method to eliminate redundant portions in the candidate skeleton. Furthermore, during the local causal orientation phase, HLCD distinguishes between V-structures and equivalence classes by comparing the local structure scores between the two, thereby avoiding orientation interference caused by local equivalence classes. We conducted extensive experiments with seven state-of-the-art competitors on 14 benchmark Bayesian network datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that HLCD significantly outperforms existing local causal discovery algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: The interpretability of deep neural networks is crucial for understanding model decisions in various applications, including computer vision. AttEXplore++, an advanced framework built upon AttEXplore, enhances attribution by incorporating transferable adversarial attack methods such as MIG and GRA, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of model explanations. We conduct extensive experiments on five models, including CNNs (Inception-v3, ResNet-50, VGG16) and vision transformers (MaxViT-T, ViT-B/16), using the ImageNet dataset. Our method achieves an average performance improvement of 7.57\% over AttEXplore and 32.62\% compared to other state-of-the-art interpretability algorithms. Using insertion and deletion scores as evaluation metrics, we show that adversarial transferability plays a vital role in enhancing attribution results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of randomness, perturbation rate, noise amplitude, and diversity probability on attribution performance, demonstrating that AttEXplore++ provides more stable and reliable explanations across various models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Goertzel</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide a comparative analysis of the deduction, induction, and abduction formulas used in Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN) and the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), two uncertain reasoning frameworks aimed at AGI. One difference between the two systems is that, at the level of individual inference rules, PLN directly leverages both term and relationship probabilities, whereas NARS only leverages relationship frequencies and has no simple analogue of term probabilities. Thus we focus here on scenarios where there is high uncertainty about term probabilities, and explore how this uncertainty influences the comparative inferential conclusions of the two systems. We compare the product of strength and confidence ($s\times c$) in PLN against the product of frequency and confidence ($f\times c$) in NARS (quantities we refer to as measuring the "power" of an uncertain statement) in cases of high term probability uncertainty, using heuristic analyses and elementary numerical computations. We find that in many practical situations with high term probability uncertainty, PLN and NARS formulas give very similar results for the power of an inference conclusion, even though they sometimes come to these similar numbers in quite different ways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Wang, Xueying Zhang, Keyang Wang, Xun Yang, Xingyi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task focuses on predicting a learner's future performance based on the historical interactions. The knowledge state plays a key role in learning process. However, considering that the knowledge state is influenced by various learning factors in the interaction process, such as the exercises similarities, responses reliability and the learner's learning state. Previous models still face two major limitations. First, due to the exercises differences caused by various complex reasons and the unreliability of responses caused by guessing behavior, it is hard to locate the historical interaction which is most relevant to the current answered exercise. Second, the learning state is also a key factor to influence the knowledge state, which is always ignored by previous methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method named Learning State Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (LSKT). Firstly, to simulate the potential differences in interactions, inspired by Item Response Theory~(IRT) paradigm, we designed three different embedding methods ranging from coarse-grained to fine-grained views and conduct comparative analysis on them. Secondly, we design a learning state extraction module to capture the changing learning state during the learning process of the learner. In turn, with the help of the extracted learning state, a more detailed knowledge state could be captured. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our LSKT method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Yang, Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Huaxiu Yao, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work focuses on building a task planner for Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works typically train a planner to imitate expert trajectories, treating this as a supervised task. While these methods achieve competitive performance, they often lack sufficient robustness. When a suboptimal action is taken, the planner may encounter an out-of-distribution state, which can lead to task failure. In contrast, we frame the task as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and aim to develop a robust planner under a few-shot assumption. Thus, we propose a closed-loop planner with an adaptation module and a novel hindsight method, aiming to use as much information as possible to assist the planner. Our experiments on the ALFRED dataset indicate that our planner achieves competitive performance under a few-shot assumption. For the first time, our few-shot agent's performance approaches and even surpasses that of the full-shot supervised agent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient multimodal large language models (EMLLMs), in contrast to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reduce model size and computational costs and are often deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, due to data privacy concerns, existing open-source EMLLMs rarely have access to private domain-specific data during the pre-training process, making them difficult to directly apply in device-specific domains, such as certain business scenarios. To address this weakness, this paper focuses on the efficient adaptation of EMLLMs to private domains, specifically in two areas: 1) how to reduce data requirements, and 2) how to avoid parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, we propose a tun\textbf{\underline{I}}ng-free, a\textbf{\underline{D}}aptiv\textbf{\underline{E}}, univers\textbf{\underline{AL}} \textbf{\underline{Prompt}} Optimization Framework, abbreviated as \textit{\textbf{\ourmethod{}}} which consists of two stages: 1) Predefined Prompt, based on the reinforcement searching strategy, generate a prompt optimization strategy tree to acquire optimization priors; 2) Prompt Reflection initializes the prompt based on optimization priors, followed by self-reflection to further search and refine the prompt. By doing so, \ourmethod{} elegantly generates the ``ideal prompts'' for processing private domain-specific data. Note that our method requires no parameter fine-tuning and only a small amount of data to quickly adapt to the data distribution of private data. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that our proposed \ourmethod{} significantly improves both efficiency and performance compared to baselines.</p>

This study develops a robust artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline aimed at predicting live birth outcomes in IVF treatments. The pipeline uses anonymized data from 2010 to 2018, obtained from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA). We evaluated the prediction performance of live birth success as a binary outcome (success/failure) by integrating different feature selection methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), with different traditional machine learning-based classifiers including random forest (RF) and decision tree, as well as deep learning-based classifiers including custom transformer-based model and a tab transformer model with an attention mechanism. Our research demonstrated that the best performance was achieved by combining PSO for feature selection with the TabTransformer-based deep learning model, yielding an accuracy of 99.50% and an AUC of 99.96%, highlighting its significant performance to predict live births. This study establishes a highly accurate AI pipeline for predicting live birth outcomes in IVF, demonstrating its potential to enhance personalized fertility treatments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijia Chen, Baochun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pradeep Sain</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for dynamic, user-centric data analysis and visualization is evident across domains like healthcare, finance, and research. Traditional visualization tools often fail to meet individual user needs due to their static and predefined nature. To address this gap, Text2Insight is introduced as an innovative solution that delivers customized data analysis and visualizations based on user-defined natural language requirements. Leveraging a multi-model architecture, Text2Insight transforms user inputs into actionable insights and dynamic visualizations.
  The methodology begins with analyzing the input dataset to extract structural details such as columns and values. A pre-trained Llama3 model converts the user's natural language query into an SQL query, which is further refined using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for accuracy. A chart predictor determines the most suitable visualization type, while the Llama3 model generates insights based on the SQL query's results. The output is a user-friendly and visually informative chart. To enhance analysis capabilities, the system integrates a question-answering model and a predictive model using the BERT framework. These models provide insights into historical data and predict future trends.
  Performance evaluation of Text2Insight demonstrates its effectiveness, achieving high accuracy (99%), precision (100%), recall (99%), and F1-score (99%), with a BLEU score of 0.5. The question-answering model attained an accuracy of 89% and the predictive model achieved 70% accuracy. These results validate Text2Insight as a robust and viable solution for transforming natural language text into dynamic, user-specific data analysis and visualizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Riemer, Zahra Ashktorab, Djallel Bouneffouf, Payel Das, Miao Liu, Justin D. Weisz, Murray Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized feedback plays a vital role in a student's learning process. While existing systems are adept at providing feedback over MCQ-based evaluation, this work focuses more on subjective and open-ended questions, which is similar to the problem of Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) with feedback. Additionally, we introduce the Multimodal Short Answer grading with Feedback (MMSAF) problem over the traditional ASAG feedback problem to address the scenario where the student answer and reference answer might contain images. Moreover, we introduce the MMSAF dataset with 2197 data points along with an automated framework for generating such data sets. Our evaluations on existing LLMs over this dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 55\% on Level of Correctness labels, 75\% on Image Relevance labels and a score of 4.27 out of 5 in correctness level of LLM generated feedback as rated by experts. As per experts, Pixtral achieved a rating of above 4 out of all metrics, indicating that it is more aligned to human judgement, and that it is the best solution for assisting students.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifu Chen, Hengnian Gu, Jin Peng Zhou, Dongdai Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis represents a fundamental research area within intelligent education, with the objective of measuring the cognitive status of individuals. Theoretically, an individual's cognitive state is essentially equivalent to their cognitive structure state. Cognitive structure state comprises two key components: knowledge state (KS) and knowledge structure state (KUS). The knowledge state reflects the learner's mastery of individual concepts, a widely studied focus within cognitive diagnosis. In contrast, the knowledge structure state-representing the learner's understanding of the relationships between concepts-remains inadequately modeled. A learner's cognitive structure is essential for promoting meaningful learning and shaping academic performance. Although various methods have been proposed, most focus on assessing KS and fail to assess KUS. To bridge this gap, we propose an innovative and effective framework-CSCD (Cognitive Structure State-based Cognitive Diagnosis)-which introduces a novel framework to modeling learners' cognitive structures in diagnostic assessments, thereby offering new insights into cognitive structure modeling. Specifically, we employ an edge-feature-based graph attention network to represent the learner's cognitive structure state, effectively integrating KS and KUS. Extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this framework in terms of diagnostic accuracy and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oudom Hean, Utsha Saha, Binita Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</p>

<p>Abstract: Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries (i.e., NL2SQL, a.k.a., Text-to-SQL) can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for developing NL2SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of NL2SQL in the LLMs era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Mert R. Sabuncu</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant causal prediction (ICP) is a popular technique for finding causal parents (direct causes) of a target via exploiting distribution shifts and invariance testing (Peters et al., 2016). However, since ICP needs to run an exponential number of tests and fails to identify parents when distribution shifts only affect a few variables, applying ICP to practical large scale problems is challenging. We propose MMSE-ICP and fastICP, two approaches which employ an error inequality to address the identifiability problem of ICP. The inequality states that the minimum prediction error of the predictor using causal parents is the smallest among all predictors which do not use descendants. fastICP is an efficient approximation tailored for large problems as it exploits the inequality and a heuristic to run fewer tests. MMSE-ICP and fastICP not only outperform competitive baselines in many simulations but also achieve state-of-the-art result on a large scale real data benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongfeng Su, Changqing Xu, Xinyi Wu, Feng Xu, Xie Chen, Lan Wangt, Nan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that emotional features from a single acoustic sentiment label can enhance depression diagnosis accuracy. Additionally, according to the Emotion Context-Insensitivity theory and our pilot study, individuals with depression might convey negative emotional content in an unexpectedly calm manner, showing a high degree of inconsistency in emotional expressions during natural conversations. So far, few studies have recognized and leveraged the emotional expression inconsistency for depression detection. In this paper, a multimodal cross-attention method is presented to capture the Acoustic-Textual Emotional Inconsistency (ATEI) information. This is achieved by analyzing the intricate local and long-term dependencies of emotional expressions across acoustic and textual domains, as well as the mismatch between the emotional content within both domains. A Transformer-based model is then proposed to integrate this ATEI information with various fusion strategies for detecting depression. Furthermore, a scaling technique is employed to adjust the ATEI feature degree during the fusion process, thereby enhancing the model's ability to discern patients with depression across varying levels of severity. To best of our knowledge, this work is the first to incorporate emotional expression inconsistency information into depression detection. Experimental results on a counseling conversational dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges.

<p>Abstract: As foundation models increasingly permeate sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and mental health, ensuring their behavior meets desired outcomes and social expectations becomes critical. Given the complexities of these high-dimensional models, traditional techniques for constraining agent behavior, which typically rely on low-dimensional, discrete state and action spaces, cannot be directly applied. Drawing inspiration from robotic action selection techniques, we propose the grounded observer framework for constraining foundation model behavior that offers both behavioral guarantees and real-time variability. This method leverages real-time assessment of low-level behavioral characteristics to dynamically adjust model actions and provide contextual feedback. To demonstrate this, we develop a system capable of sustaining contextually appropriate, casual conversations ("small talk"), which we then apply to a robot for novel, unscripted interactions with humans. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the framework for other social contexts and areas for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karishma Thakrar</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GRAG framework, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ratnesh Kumar Joshi, Sagnik Sengupta, Asif Ekbal</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination, a persistent challenge plaguing language models, undermines their efficacy and trustworthiness in various natural language processing endeavors by generating responses that deviate from factual accuracy or coherence. This paper addresses language model hallucination by integrating curated knowledge graph (KG) triples to anchor responses in empirical data. We meticulously select and integrate relevant KG triples tailored to specific contexts, enhancing factual grounding and alignment with input. Our contribution involves constructing a comprehensive KG repository from Wikipedia and refining data to spotlight essential information for model training. By imbuing language models with access to this curated knowledge, we aim to generate both linguistically fluent responses and deeply rooted in factual accuracy and context relevance. This integration mitigates hallucinations by providing a robust foundation of information, enabling models to draw upon a rich reservoir of factual data during response generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple approaches in reducing hallucinatory responses, underscoring the role of curated knowledge graphs in improving the reliability and trustworthiness of language model outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: An image may convey a thousand words, but a video composed of hundreds or thousands of image frames tells a more intricate story. Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Beutel, Kai Xiao, Johannes Heidecke, Lilian Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated red teaming can discover rare model failures and generate challenging examples that can be used for training or evaluation. However, a core challenge in automated red teaming is ensuring that the attacks are both diverse and effective. Prior methods typically succeed in optimizing either for diversity or for effectiveness, but rarely both. In this paper, we provide methods that enable automated red teaming to generate a large number of diverse and successful attacks.
  Our approach decomposes the task into two steps: (1) automated methods for generating diverse attack goals and (2) generating effective attacks for those goals. While we provide multiple straightforward methods for generating diverse goals, our key contributions are to train an RL attacker that both follows those goals and generates diverse attacks for those goals. First, we demonstrate that it is easy to use a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse attacker goals with per-goal prompts and rewards, including rule-based rewards (RBRs) to grade whether the attacks are successful for the particular goal. Second, we demonstrate how training the attacker model with multi-step RL, where the model is rewarded for generating attacks that are different from past attempts further increases diversity while remaining effective. We use our approach to generate both prompt injection attacks and prompts that elicit unsafe responses. In both cases, we find that our approach is able to generate highly-effective and considerably more diverse attacks than past general red-teaming approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlin Feng, Simone Papicchio, Sajjadur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (edge et al., 2024). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi, Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam, Bin Liu, Mei Liu, Zijun Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival analysis (SA) models have been widely studied in mining electronic health records (EHRs), particularly in forecasting the risk of critical conditions for prioritizing high-risk patients. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks is much less explored in the literature. Developing black-box perturbation algorithms and evaluating their impact on state-of-the-art survival models brings two benefits to medical applications. First, it can effectively evaluate the robustness of models in pre-deployment testing. Also, exploring how subtle perturbations would result in significantly different outcomes can provide counterfactual insights into the clinical interpretation of model prediction. In this work, we introduce SurvAttack, a novel black-box adversarial attack framework leveraging subtle clinically compatible, and semantically consistent perturbations on longitudinal EHRs to degrade survival models' predictive performance. We specifically develop a greedy algorithm to manipulate medical codes with various adversarial actions throughout a patient's medical history. Then, these adversarial actions are prioritized using a composite scoring strategy based on multi-aspect perturbation quality, including saliency, perturbation stealthiness, and clinical meaningfulness. The proposed adversarial EHR perturbation algorithm is then used in an efficient SA-specific strategy to attack a survival model when estimating the temporal ranking of survival urgency for patients. To demonstrate the significance of our work, we conduct extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons, explainability analysis, and case studies. The experimental results affirm our research's effectiveness in illustrating the vulnerabilities of patient survival models, model interpretation, and ultimately contributing to healthcare quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taohong Zhu, Adrians Skapars, Fardeen Mackenzie, Declan Kehoe, William Newton, Suzanne Embury, Youcheng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Fuzz testing effectively uncovers software vulnerabilities; however, it faces challenges with Autonomous Systems (AS) due to their vast search spaces and complex state spaces, which reflect the unpredictability and complexity of real-world environments. This paper presents a universal framework aimed at improving the efficiency of fuzz testing for AS. At its core is SaFliTe, a predictive component that evaluates whether a test case meets predefined safety criteria. By leveraging the large language model (LLM) with information about the test objective and the AS state, SaFliTe assesses the relevance of each test case. We evaluated SaFliTe by instantiating it with various LLMs, including GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-7B, and integrating it into four fuzz testing tools: PGFuzz, DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB. These tools are designed specifically for testing autonomous drone control systems, such as ArduPilot, PX4, and PX4-Avoidance. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to PGFuzz, SaFliTe increased the likelihood of selecting operations that triggered bug occurrences in each fuzzing iteration by an average of 93.1\%. Additionally, after integrating SaFliTe, the ability of DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB to generate test cases that caused system violations increased by 234.5\%, 33.3\%, and 17.8\%, respectively. The benchmark for this evaluation was sourced from a UAV Testing Competition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanna Ding, Zijie Huang, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Jianxi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world complex systems, such as epidemic spreading networks and ecosystems, can be modeled as networked dynamical systems that produce multivariate time series. Learning the intrinsic dynamics from observational data is pivotal for forecasting system behaviors and making informed decisions. However, existing methods for modeling networked time series often assume known topologies, whereas real-world networks are typically incomplete or inaccurate, with missing or spurious links that hinder precise predictions. Moreover, while networked time series often originate from diverse topologies, the ability of models to generalize across topologies has not been systematically evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for learning network dynamics directly from observed time-series data, when prior knowledge of graph topology or governing dynamical equations is absent. Our approach leverages continuous graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to construct a latent topology, enabling accurate reconstruction of future trajectories for network states. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that our model not only captures dynamics effectively without topology knowledge but also generalizes to unseen time series originating from diverse topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milton L. Montero, Jeffrey S. Bowers, Gaurav Malhotra</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, it has been shown empirically that standard disentangled latent variable models do not support robust compositional learning in the visual domain. Indeed, in spite of being designed with the goal of factorising datasets into their constituent factors of variations, disentangled models show extremely limited compositional generalisation capabilities. On the other hand, object-centric architectures have shown promising compositional skills, albeit these have 1) not been extensively tested and 2) experiments have been limited to scene composition -- where models must generalise to novel combinations of objects in a visual scene instead of novel combinations of object properties. In this work, we show that these compositional generalisation skills extend to this later setting. Furthermore, we present evidence pointing to the source of these skills and how they can be improved through careful training. Finally, we point to one important limitation that still exists which suggests new directions of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Nakhla Rafi, Dong Jae Kim, Tse-Hsun Chen, Shaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in software engineering tasks like Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study examines how input order and context size affect LLM performance in FL, a key step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We test different orders for methods using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths come first) and "worst" (where ground truths come last). Our results show a strong bias in order, with Top-1 accuracy falling from 57\% to 20\% when we reverse the code order. Breaking down inputs into smaller contexts helps reduce this bias, narrowing the performance gap between perfect and worst orders from 22\% to just 1\%. We also look at ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics. Ordering using DepGraph's ranking achieves 48\% Top-1 accuracy, better than more straightforward ordering approaches like CallGraph. These findings underscore the importance of how we structure inputs, manage contexts, and choose ordering methods to improve LLM performance in FL and other software engineering tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan Nguyen, Coy D. Heldermon, Corey Toler-Franklin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method that extends the self-attention mechanism of a vision transformer (ViT) for more accurate object detection across diverse datasets. ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to their ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual tokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they do not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with neighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic because tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other tokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is further compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from different semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these limitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention framework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature mixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction and feature exchange between semantic concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that local and global information exchange among visual features before self-attention significantly improves performance on challenging object detection tasks and generalizes across multiple benchmark datasets and challenging medical datasets. We publish source code and a novel dataset of cancerous tumors (chimeric cell clusters).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human skeleton-based action recognition has long been an indispensable aspect of artificial intelligence. Current state-of-the-art methods tend to consider only the dependencies between connected skeletal joints, limiting their ability to capture non-linear dependencies between physically distant joints. Moreover, most existing approaches distinguish action classes by estimating the probability density of motion representations, yet the high-dimensional nature of human motions invokes inherent difficulties in accomplishing such measurements. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from two directions: (1) We propose a novel dependency refinement approach that explicitly models dependencies between any pair of joints, effectively transcending the limitations imposed by joint distance. (2) We further propose a framework that utilizes the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to differentiate action classes without being affected by data dimensionality, and mathematically derive learning objectives guaranteeing precise recognition. Empirically, our approach sets the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently exploring complex loss landscapes is key to the performance of deep neural networks. While momentum-based optimizers are widely used in state-of-the-art setups, classical momentum can still struggle with large, misaligned gradients, leading to oscillations. To address this, we propose Torque-Aware Momentum (TAM), which introduces a damping factor based on the angle between the new gradients and previous momentum, stabilizing the update direction during training. Empirical results show that TAM, which can be combined with both SGD and Adam, enhances exploration, handles distribution shifts more effectively, and improves generalization performance across various tasks, including image classification and large language model fine-tuning, when compared to classical momentum-based optimizers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanpu Cao, Shu Yang, Zhengjian Chen, Ye Liu, Laizhong Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting, Transformer-based models have achieved great success, due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing transformer-based methods face challenges in accurately identifying which variables play a pivotal role in the prediction process and tend to overemphasize noisy channels, thereby limiting the interpretability and practical effectiveness of the models. Besides, it faces scalability issues due to quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this paper, we propose a new model named Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), which addresses these challenges in long-term multivariate time series forecasting by designing an improved Transformer-based structure. Ister firstly decomposes original time series into seasonal and trend components. Then we propose a new Dot-attention mechanism to process the seasonal component, which improves both accuracy, computation complexity and interpretability. Upon completion of the training phase, it allows users to intuitively visualize the significance of each feature in the overall prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that Ister achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, surpassing existing models in long-term prediction tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern autonomous vehicle simulators feature an ever-growing library of assets, including vehicles, buildings, roads, pedestrians, and more. While this level of customization proves beneficial when creating virtual urban environments, this process becomes cumbersome when intending to train within a digital twin or a duplicate of a real scene. Gaussian splatting emerged as a powerful technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, boasting high fidelity and rendering speeds. In this paper, we introduce GSAVS, an autonomous vehicle simulator that supports the creation and development of autonomous vehicle models. Every asset within the simulator is a 3D Gaussian splat, including the vehicles and the environment. However, the simulator runs within a classical 3D engine, rendering 3D Gaussian splats in real-time. This allows the simulator to utilize the photorealism that 3D Gaussian splatting boasts while providing the customization and ease of use of a classical 3D engine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ChenRui Duan, Zelin Zang, Siyuan Li, Yongjie Xu, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Phylogenetic trees elucidate evolutionary relationships among species, but phylogenetic inference remains challenging due to the complexity of combining continuous (branch lengths) and discrete parameters (tree topology). Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods face slow convergence and computational burdens. Existing Variational Inference methods, which require pre-generated topologies and typically treat tree structures and branch lengths independently, may overlook critical sequence features, limiting their accuracy and flexibility. We propose PhyloGen, a novel method leveraging a pre-trained genomic language model to generate and optimize phylogenetic trees without dependence on evolutionary models or aligned sequence constraints. PhyloGen views phylogenetic inference as a conditionally constrained tree structure generation problem, jointly optimizing tree topology and branch lengths through three core modules: (i) Feature Extraction, (ii) PhyloTree Construction, and (iii) PhyloTree Structure Modeling. Meanwhile, we introduce a Scoring Function to guide the model towards a more stable gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PhyloGen on eight real-world benchmark datasets. Visualization results confirm PhyloGen provides deeper insights into phylogenetic relationships.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous real-time MRI (rtMRI)-based speech synthesis models depend heavily on noisy ground-truth speech. Applying loss directly over ground truth mel-spectrograms entangles speech content with MRI noise, resulting in poor intelligibility. We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. We assess our framework's performance by masking parts of the rtMRI video to evaluate the impact of different articulators on text prediction. Our method achieves a $15.18\%$ Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

<p>Abstract: Current Non-Audible Murmur (NAM)-to-speech techniques rely on voice cloning to simulate ground-truth speech from paired whispers. However, the simulated speech often lacks intelligibility and fails to generalize well across different speakers. To address this issue, we focus on learning phoneme-level alignments from paired whispers and text and employ a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to simulate the ground-truth. To reduce dependence on whispers, we learn phoneme alignments directly from NAMs, though the quality is constrained by the available training data. To further mitigate reliance on NAM/whisper data for ground-truth simulation, we propose incorporating the lip modality to infer speech and introduce a novel diffusion-based method that leverages recent advancements in lip-to-speech technology. Additionally, we release the MultiNAM dataset with over $7.96$ hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers and benchmark all methods on this dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyu Yang, Yunpeng Wang, Jianchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer neural operators have recently become an effective approach for surrogate modeling of nonlinear systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we introduce a modified implicit factorized transformer (IFactFormer-m) model which replaces the original chained factorized attention with parallel factorized attention. The IFactFormer-m model successfully performs long-term predictions for turbulent channel flow, whereas the original IFactFormer (IFactFormer-o), Fourier neural operator (FNO), and implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) exhibit a poor performance. Turbulent channel flows are simulated by direct numerical simulation using fine grids at friction Reynolds numbers $\text{Re}_{\tau}\approx 180,395,590$, and filtered to coarse grids for training neural operator. The neural operator takes the current flow field as input and predicts the flow field at the next time step, and long-term prediction is achieved in the posterior through an autoregressive approach. The prediction results show that IFactFormer-m, compared to other neural operators and the traditional large eddy simulation (LES) methods including dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, reduces prediction errors in the short term, and achieves stable and accurate long-term prediction of various statistical properties and flow structures, including the energy spectrum, mean streamwise velocity, root mean square (rms) values of fluctuating velocities, Reynolds shear stress, and spatial structures of instantaneous velocity. Moreover, the trained IFactFormer-m is much faster than traditional LES methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihao Cheng, Da Yan, Tianhao Wu, Zhongyi Huang, Qin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a graph pair $(G^1, G^2)$, graph edit distance (GED) is defined as the minimum number of edit operations converting $G^1$ to $G^2$. GED is a fundamental operation widely used in many applications, but its exact computation is NP-hard, so the approximation of GED has gained a lot of attention. Data-driven learning-based methods have been found to provide superior results compared to classical approximate algorithms, but they directly fit the coupling relationship between a pair of vertices from their vertex features. We argue that while pairwise vertex features can capture the coupling cost (discrepancy) of a pair of vertices, the vertex coupling matrix should be derived from the vertex-pair cost matrix through a more well-established method that is aware of the global context of the graph pair, such as optimal transport. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach that integrates a supervised learning-based method and an unsupervised method, both based on optimal transport. Our learning method, GEDIOT, is based on inverse optimal transport that leverages a learnable Sinkhorn algorithm to generate the coupling matrix. Our unsupervised method, GEDGW, models GED computation as a linear combination of optimal transport and its variant, Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy, for node and edge operations, respectively, which can be solved efficiently without needing the ground truth. Our ensemble method, GEDHOT, combines GEDIOT and GEDGW to further boost the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform the existing methods in terms of the performance of GED computation, edit path generation, and model generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Qian, Yuhu Guo, Wenjing Li, Gustav Markkula</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tools in diverse domains, yet their moral reasoning capabilities across cultural and linguistic contexts remain underexplored. This study investigates whether multilingual LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and MistralNeMo, reflect culturally specific moral values or impose dominant moral norms, particularly those rooted in English. Using the updated Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-2) in eight languages, Arabic, Farsi, English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, French, and Russian, the study analyzes the models' adherence to six core moral foundations: care, equality, proportionality, loyalty, authority, and purity. The results reveal significant cultural and linguistic variability, challenging the assumption of universal moral consistency in LLMs. Although some models demonstrate adaptability to diverse contexts, others exhibit biases influenced by the composition of the training data. These findings underscore the need for culturally inclusive model development to improve fairness and trust in multilingual AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lumbar disk segmentation is essential for diagnosing and curing spinal disorders by enabling precise detection of disk boundaries in medical imaging. The advent of deep learning has resulted in the development of many segmentation methods, offering differing levels of accuracy and effectiveness. This study assesses the effectiveness of several sophisticated deep learning architectures, including ResUnext, Ef3 Net, UNet, and TransUNet, for lumbar disk segmentation, highlighting key metrics like as Pixel Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU), and Dice Coefficient. The findings indicate that ResUnext achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, with a Pixel Accuracy of 0.9492 and a Dice Coefficient of 0.8425, with TransUNet following closely after. Filtering techniques somewhat enhanced the performance of most models, particularly Dense UNet, improving stability and segmentation quality. The findings underscore the efficacy of these models in lumbar disk segmentation and highlight potential areas for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Zou, Evelyn Zhang, Runlin Guo, Haohang Xu, Conghui He, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation remains a challenging problem. One of the biggest difficulties lies in training models to generalize to an unlimited number of classes using limited categorized training data. Recent popular methods involve large-scale vision-language pre-trained foundation models, such as CLIP. In this paper, we propose OMTSeg for open-vocabulary segmentation using another large-scale vision-language pre-trained model called BEiT-3 and leveraging the cross-modal attention between visual and linguistic features in BEiT-3 to achieve better performance. Experiments result demonstrates that OMTSeg performs favorably against state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junying Chen, Zhenyang Cai, Ke Ji, Xidong Wang, Wanlong Liu, Rongsheng Wang, Jianye Hou, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The breakthrough of OpenAI o1 highlights the potential of enhancing reasoning to improve LLM. Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Exemplar-Condensed federated class-incremental learning (ECoral) to distil the training characteristics of real images from streaming data into informative rehearsal exemplars. The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassine Chemingui, Aryan Deshwal, Honghao Wei, Alan Fern, Janardhan Rao Doppa</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (OSRL) involves learning a decision-making policy to maximize rewards from a fixed batch of training data to satisfy pre-defined safety constraints. However, adapting to varying safety constraints during deployment without retraining remains an under-explored challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce constraint-adaptive policy switching (CAPS), a wrapper framework around existing offline RL algorithms. During training, CAPS uses offline data to learn multiple policies with a shared representation that optimize different reward and cost trade-offs. During testing, CAPS switches between those policies by selecting at each state the policy that maximizes future rewards among those that satisfy the current cost constraint. Our experiments on 38 tasks from the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that CAPS consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong wrapper-based baseline for OSRL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zuo, Yirui Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating medically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks to patient care. This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Nayyem, Abdullah Rakin, Longwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the intricate relationship between interpretability and robustness in deep learning models. Despite their remarkable performance across various tasks, deep learning models often exhibit critical vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks, over-reliance on spurious correlations, and a lack of transparency in their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to systematically enhance model robustness. By identifying and mitigating the influence of irrelevant or misleading features, our approach iteratively refines the model, penalizing reliance on these features during training. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that LIME-guided refinement not only improves interpretability but also significantly enhances resistance to adversarial perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhefan Rao, Liya Ji, Yazhou Xing, Runtao Liu, Zhaoyang Liu, Jiaxin Xie, Ziqiao Peng, Yingqing He, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has gained significant attention recently. However, the costs of training a T2V model from scratch remain persistently high, and there is considerable room for improving the generation performance, especially under limited computation resources. This work explores the continual general pre-training of text-to-video models, enabling the model to "grow" its abilities based on a pre-trained foundation, analogous to how humans acquire new knowledge based on past experiences. There is a lack of extensive study of the continual pre-training techniques in T2V generation. In this work, we take the initial step toward exploring this task systematically and propose ModelGrow. Specifically, we break this task into two key aspects: increasing model capacity and improving semantic understanding. For model capacity, we introduce several novel techniques to expand the model size, enabling it to store new knowledge and improve generation performance. For semantic understanding, we propose a method that leverages large language models as advanced text encoders, integrating them into T2V models to enhance language comprehension and guide generation results according to detailed prompts. This approach enables the model to achieve better semantic alignment, particularly in response to complex user prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various metrics. The source code and the model of ModelGrow will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The availability of pre-trained models (PTMs) has enabled faster deployment of machine learning across applications by reducing the need for extensive training. Techniques like quantization and distillation have further expanded PTM applicability to resource-constrained IoT hardware. Given the many PTM options for any given task, engineers often find it too costly to evaluate each model's suitability. Approaches such as LogME, LEEP, and ModelSpider help streamline model selection by estimating task relevance without exhaustive tuning. However, these methods largely leave hardware constraints as future work-a significant limitation in IoT settings. In this paper, we identify the limitations of current model recommendation approaches regarding hardware constraints and introduce a novel, hardware-aware method for PTM selection. We also propose a research agenda to guide the development of effective, hardware-conscious model recommendation systems for IoT applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Dilara Yavuz, M. Emre Gursoy</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of natural language processing (NLP) and pre-trained language models have enabled accurate text classification in a variety of settings. However, text classification models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where an attacker embeds a trigger into the victim model to make the model predict attacker-desired labels in targeted scenarios. In this paper, we propose to utilize backdoor attacks for a new purpose: bias injection. We develop a backdoor attack in which a subset of the training dataset is poisoned to associate strong male actors with negative sentiment. We execute our attack on two popular text classification datasets (IMDb and SST) and seven different models ranging from traditional Doc2Vec-based models to LSTM networks and modern transformer-based BERT and RoBERTa models. Our results show that the reduction in backdoored models' benign classification accuracy is limited, implying that our attacks remain stealthy, whereas the models successfully learn to associate strong male actors with negative sentiment (100% attack success rate with >= 3% poison rate). Attacks on BERT and RoBERTa are particularly more stealthy and effective, demonstrating an increased risk of using modern and larger models. We also measure the generalizability of our bias injection by proposing two metrics: (i) U-BBSR which uses previously unseen words when measuring attack success, and (ii) P-BBSR which measures attack success using paraphrased test samples. U-BBSR and P-BBSR results show that the bias injected by our attack can go beyond memorizing a trigger phrase.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating software engineering tasks, particularly in code generation. However, current evaluation benchmarks, which primarily focus on accuracy, fall short in assessing the quality of the code generated by these models, specifically their tendency to produce code smells. To address this limitation, we introduce CodeSmellEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate the propensity of LLMs for generating code smells. Our benchmark includes a novel metric: Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), and a curated dataset of method-level code smells: CodeSmellData. To demonstrate the use of CodeSmellEval, we conducted a case study with two state-of-the-art LLMs, CodeLlama and Mistral. The results reveal that both models tend to generate code smells, such as simplifiable-condition and consider-merging-isinstance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our benchmark in evaluating LLMs, providing valuable insights into their reliability and their propensity to introduce code smells in code generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the integration of Lidar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery through advanced artificial intelligence techniques for enhanced urban mapping. By fusing these diverse geospatial datasets, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with single-sensor data, achieving a more comprehensive representation of urban environments. The research employs Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) as the primary deep learning model for urban feature extraction, enabling precise pixel-wise classification of essential urban elements, including buildings, roads, and vegetation. To optimize the performance of the FCN model, we utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning, significantly enhancing model accuracy. Key findings indicate that the FCN-PSO model achieved a pixel accuracy of 92.3% and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 87.6%, surpassing traditional single-sensor approaches. These results underscore the potential of fused geospatial data and AI-driven methodologies in urban mapping, providing valuable insights for urban planning and management.

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) poses significant challenges for edge inference deployment due to resource and power constraints of edge devices. Recent works on unary-based matrix multiplication hardware aim to leverage data sparsity and low-precision values to enhance hardware efficiency. However, the adoption and integration of such unary hardware into commercial deep learning accelerators (DLA) remain limited due to processing element (PE) array dataflow differences. This work presents Tempus Core, a convolution core with highly scalable unary-based PE array comprising of tub (temporal-unary-binary) multipliers that seamlessly integrates with the NVDLA (NVIDIA's open-source DLA for accelerating CNNs) while maintaining dataflow compliance and boosting hardware efficiency. Analysis across various datapath granularities shows that for INT8 precision in 45nm CMOS, Tempus Core's PE cell unit (PCU) yields 59.3% and 15.3% reductions in area and power consumption, respectively, over NVDLA's CMAC unit. Considering a 16x16 PE array in Tempus Core, area and power improves by 75% and 62%, respectively, while delivering 5x and 4x iso-area throughput improvements for INT8 and INT4 precisions. Post-place and route analysis of Tempus Core's PCU shows that the 16x4 PE array for INT4 precision in 45nm CMOS requires only 0.017 mm^2 die area and consumes only 6.2mW of total power. We demonstrate that area-power efficient unary-based hardware can be seamlessly integrated into conventional DLAs, paving the path for efficient unary hardware for edge AI inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audiovisual Automatic Speech Recognition (AV-ASR) aims to improve speech recognition accuracy by leveraging visual signals. It is particularly challenging in unconstrained real-world scenarios across various domains due to noisy acoustic environments, spontaneous speech, and the uncertain use of visual information. Most previous works fine-tune audio-only ASR models on audiovisual datasets, optimizing them for conventional ASR objectives. However, they often neglect visual features and common errors in unconstrained video scenarios. In this paper, we propose using a preference optimization strategy to improve speech recognition accuracy for real-world videos. First, we create preference data via simulating common errors that occurred in AV-ASR from two focals: manipulating the audio or vision input and rewriting the output transcript. Second, we propose BPO-AVASR, a Bifocal Preference Optimization method to improve AV-ASR models by leveraging both input-side and output-side preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves speech recognition accuracy across various domains, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models on real-world video speech recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain aging is a complex and dynamic process, leading to functional and structural changes in the brain. These changes could lead to the increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. Accurate brain-age estimation utilizing neuroimaging data has become necessary for detecting initial signs of neurodegeneration. Here, we propose a novel deep learning approach using the Residual Neural Network 101 Version 2 (ResNet101V2) model to predict brain age from MRI scans. To train, validate and test our proposed model, we used a large dataset of 2102 images which were selected randomly from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM). Next, we applied data preprocessing techniques, including normalizing the images and using outlier detection via Isolation Forest method. Then, we evaluated various pre-trained approaches (namely: MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, Xception). The results demonstrated that the ResNet101V2 model has higher performance compared with the other models, attaining MAEs of 0.9136 and 0.8242 years for before and after using Isolation Forest process. Our method achieved a high accuracy in brain age estimation in ICBM dataset and it provides a reliable brain age prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Liu, Rongjie Li, Chongyu Wang, Xuming He</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (OV-SGG) overcomes the limitations of the closed-set assumption by aligning visual relationship representations with open-vocabulary textual representations. This enables the identification of novel visual relationships, making it applicable to real-world scenarios with diverse relationships. However, existing OV-SGG methods are constrained by fixed text representations, limiting diversity and accuracy in image-text alignment. To address these challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Hierarchical Prompting (RAHP) framework, which enhances text representation by integrating subject-object and region-specific relation information. Our approach utilizes entity clustering to address the complexity of relation triplet categories, enabling the effective integration of subject-object information. Additionally, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed region-aware prompts, capturing fine-grained visual interactions and improving alignment between visual and textual modalities. RAHP also introduces a dynamic selection mechanism within Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which adaptively selects relevant text prompts based on the visual content, reducing noise from irrelevant prompts. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary scene graph generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models have been applied to various software development tasks, but the performance varies according to the scale of the models. Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform Small Language Models (SLMs) in complex tasks like repository-level issue resolving, but raise concerns about privacy and cost. In contrast, SLMs are more accessible but under-perform in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce ReSAT (Repository Structure-Aware Training), construct training data based on a large number of issues and corresponding pull requests from open-source communities to enhance the model's understanding of repository structure and issue resolving ability. We construct two types of training data: (1) localization training data, a multi-level progressive localization data to improve code understanding and localization capability; (2) code edit training data, which improves context-based code editing capability. The evaluation results on SWE-Bench-verified and RepoQA demonstrate that ReSAT effectively enhances SLMs' issue-resolving and repository-level long-context understanding capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Zheng, Tianyi Hu, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks significantly compromise the security of large language models by triggering them to output specific and controlled content. Currently, triggers for textual backdoor attacks fall into two categories: fixed-token triggers and sentence-pattern triggers. However, the former are typically easy to identify and filter, while the latter, such as syntax and style, do not apply to all original samples and may lead to semantic shifts. In this paper, inspired by cross-lingual (CL) prompts of LLMs in real-world scenarios, we propose a higher-dimensional trigger method at the paragraph level, namely CL-attack. CL-attack injects the backdoor by using texts with specific structures that incorporate multiple languages, thereby offering greater stealthiness and universality compared to existing backdoor attack techniques. Extensive experiments on different tasks and model architectures demonstrate that CL-attack can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate with a low poisoning rate in both classification and generation tasks. We also empirically show that the CL-attack is more robust against current major defense methods compared to baseline backdoor attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Alfani Handoyo, Chung Tran, Dessi Puji Lestari, Sakriani Sakti</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual text-to-speech systems convert text into speech across multiple languages. In many cases, text sentences may contain segments in different languages, a phenomenon known as code-switching. This is particularly common in Indonesia, especially between Indonesian and English. Despite its significance, no research has yet developed a multilingual TTS system capable of handling code-switching between these two languages. This study addresses Indonesian-English code-switching in STEN-TTS. Key modifications include adding a language identification component to the text-to-phoneme conversion using finetuned BERT for per-word language identification, as well as removing language embedding from the base model. Experimental results demonstrate that the code-switching model achieves superior naturalness and improved speech intelligibility compared to the Indonesian and English baseline STEN-TTS models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Huang, Weidong Chen, Bo Hu, Zhendong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying abnormal patterns or events in data that consist of multiple interrelated time series. In order to better model the complex interdependence between entities and the various inherent characteristics of each entity, the GNN based methods are widely adopted by existing methods. In each layer of GNN, node features aggregate information from their neighboring nodes to update their information. In doing so, from shallow layer to deep layer in GNN, original individual node features continue to be weakened and more structural information,i.e., from short-distance neighborhood to long-distance neighborhood, continues to be enhanced. However, research to date has largely ignored the understanding of how hierarchical graph information is represented and their characteristics that can benefit anomaly detection. Existing methods simply leverage the output from the last layer of GNN for anomaly estimation while neglecting the essential information contained in the intermediate GNN layers. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a Graph Mixture of Experts (Graph-MoE) network for multivariate time series anomaly detection, which incorporates the mixture of experts (MoE) module to adaptively represent and integrate hierarchical multi-layer graph information into entity representations. It is worth noting that our Graph-MoE can be integrated into any GNN-based MTS anomaly detection method in a plug-and-play manner. In addition, the memory-augmented routers are proposed in this paper to capture the correlation temporal information in terms of the global historical features of MTS to adaptively weigh the obtained entity representations to achieve successful anomaly estimation. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets prove the superiority of our approach and each proposed module.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work explores the theoretical and practical foundations of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models, which leverage stochastic processes and Brownian motion to model complex data distributions. These models employ forward and reverse diffusion processes defined through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to iteratively add and remove noise, enabling high-quality data generation. By analyzing the performance bounds of these models, we demonstrate how score estimation errors propagate through the reverse process and bound the total variation distance using discrete Girsanov transformations, Pinsker's inequality, and the data processing inequality (DPI) for an information theoretic lens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical imaging, addressing the chronic challenge of limited labeled data in healthcare settings. While SSL has shown impressive results, existing studies in the medical domain are often limited in scope, focusing on specific datasets or modalities, or evaluating only isolated aspects of model performance. This fragmented evaluation approach poses a significant challenge, as models deployed in critical medical settings must not only achieve high accuracy but also demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse datasets and varying conditions. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive evaluation of SSL methods within the medical domain, with a particular focus on robustness and generalizability. Using the MedMNIST dataset collection as a standardized benchmark, we evaluate 8 major SSL methods across 11 different medical datasets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of model performance in both in-domain scenarios and the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, while exploring the effect of various initialization strategies, model architectures, and multi-domain pre-training. We further assess the generalizability of SSL methods through cross-dataset evaluations and the in-domain performance with varying label proportions (1%, 10%, and 100%) to simulate real-world scenarios with limited supervision. We hope this comprehensive benchmark helps practitioners and researchers make more informed decisions when applying SSL methods to medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azze-Eddine Maredj, Madjid Sadallah</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital content, the task of summarizing multimedia documents, which encompass textual, visual, and auditory elements, presents intricate challenges. These challenges include extracting pertinent information from diverse formats, maintaining the structural integrity and semantic coherence of the original content, and generating concise yet informative summaries. This paper introduces a novel framework for multimedia document summarization that capitalizes on the inherent structure of the document to craft coherent and succinct summaries. Central to this framework is the incorporation of a rhetorical structure for structural analysis, augmented by a graph-based representation to facilitate the extraction of pivotal information. Weighting algorithms are employed to assign significance values to document units, thereby enabling effective ranking and selection of relevant content. Furthermore, the framework is designed to accommodate user preferences and time constraints, ensuring the production of personalized and contextually relevant summaries. The summarization process is elaborately delineated, encompassing document specification, graph construction, unit weighting, and summary extraction, supported by illustrative examples and algorithmic elucidation. This proposed framework represents a significant advancement in automatic summarization, with broad potential applications across multimedia document processing, promising transformative impacts in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dejie Yang, Zijing Zhao,  YangLiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, fine-grained sentiment analysis in finance has gained significant attention, but the scarcity of entity-level datasets remains a key challenge. To address this, we have constructed the largest English and Chinese financial entity-level sentiment analysis datasets to date. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel two-stage sentiment analysis approach called Self-aware In-context Learning Correction (SILC). The first stage involves fine-tuning a base large language model to generate pseudo-labeled data specific to our task. In the second stage, we train a correction model using a GNN-based example retriever, which is informed by the pseudo-labeled data. This two-stage strategy has allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the newly constructed datasets, advancing the field of financial sentiment analysis. In a case study, we demonstrate the enhanced practical utility of our data and methods in monitoring the cryptocurrency market.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Yang, Yifan Wu, Yizhang Zhu, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart understanding tasks such as ChartQA and Chart-to-Text involve automatically extracting and interpreting key information from charts, enabling users to query or convert visual data into structured formats. State-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on visual cues from chart images, failing to explicitly incorporate rich textual information (e.g., data labels and axis labels) embedded within the charts. This textual information is vital for intuitive human comprehension and interpretation of charts. Moreover, existing models are often large and computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce AskChart, a universal model that explicitly integrates both textual and visual cues from charts using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. AskChart facilitates the learning of enhanced visual-textual representations of charts for effectively handling multiple chart understanding tasks, while maintaining a smaller model size. To capture the synergy between visual and textual modalities, we curate a large-scale dataset named ChartBank with about 7.5M data samples, which helps align textual and visual information and facilitates the extraction of visual entities and text. To effectively train AskChart, we design a three-stage training strategy to align visual and textual modalities for learning robust visual-textual representations and optimizing the learning of the MoE layer. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains of AskChart in four chart understanding tasks. Remarkably, AskChart with 4.6B parameters outperforms state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters by 68.3% in Open-ended ChartQA and 49.2% in Chart-to-Text tasks, while achieving comparable performance in ChartQA and Chart-to-Table tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungkyu Kim, Kibok Lee, Taeyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have recently demonstrated effectiveness in tabular data imputation. However, due to the inherent heterogeneity of tabular data, the uniform random masking strategy commonly used in MAEs can disrupt the distribution of missingness, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a proportional masking strategy for MAEs. Specifically, we first compute the statistics of missingness based on the observed proportions in the dataset, and then generate masks that align with these statistics, ensuring that the distribution of missingness is preserved after masking. Furthermore, we argue that simple MLP-based token mixing offers competitive or often superior performance compared to attention mechanisms while being more computationally efficient, especially in the tabular domain with the inherent heterogeneity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed proportional masking strategy across various missing data patterns in tabular datasets.

We explore the principles of DRL and its synergy with ICL, demonstrating how this combination not only improves training efficiency but also equips mobile robots with the generalization capability required for navigating through dynamic indoor environments. Empirical results indicate that robots trained with our ICL-enhanced DRL framework outperform those trained without curriculum learning, highlighting the benefits of structured learning progressions in robotic training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun K. Sharma, Shubhobrata Bhattacharya, Motahar Reza</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional biometric systems, like face and fingerprint recognition, have encountered significant setbacks due to wearing face masks and hygiene concerns. To meet the challenges of the partially covered face due to face masks and hygiene concerns of fingerprint recognition, this paper proposes a novel dual-channel multi-attention Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for biometric authentication using forehead subcutaneous vein patterns and periocular patterns, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch. The proposed framework leverages a dual-channel ViT architecture, designed to handle two distinct biometric traits. It can capture long-range dependencies of independent features from the vein and periocular patterns. A custom classifier is then designed to integrate the independently extracted features, producing a final class prediction. The performance of the proposed algorithm was rigorously evaluated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database. The results demonstrated the superiority of the algorithm over state-of-the-art methods, achieving remarkable classification accuracy of $99.3 \pm 0.02\%$ with the combined vein and periocular patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synchronization is an emergent phenomenon in coupled dynamical networks. The Master Stability Function (MSF) is a highly elegant and powerful tool for characterizing the stability of synchronization states. However, a significant challenge lies in determining the MSF for complex dynamical networks driven by nonlinear interaction mechanisms. These mechanisms introduce additional complexity through the intricate connectivity of interacting elements within the network and the intrinsic dynamics, which are governed by nonlinear processes with diverse parameters and higher dimensionality of systems. Over the past 25 years, extensive research has focused on determining the MSF for pairwise coupled identical systems with diffusive coupling. Our literature survey highlights two significant advancements in recent years: the consideration of multilayer networks instead of single-layer networks and the extension of MSF analysis to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions.
  In this review article, we revisit the analysis of the MSF for diffusively pairwise coupled dynamical systems and extend this framework to more general coupling schemes. Furthermore, we systematically derive the MSF for multilayer dynamical networks and single-layer coupled systems by incorporating higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. The primary focus of our review is on the analytical derivation and numerical computation of the MSF for complex dynamical networks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the MSF in data science, emphasizing its relevance and potential in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Du, Yuqi Liu, Qin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time}} to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image change description, as a novel multimodal task in the field of remote sensing processing, not only enables the detection of changes in surface conditions but also provides detailed descriptions of these changes, thereby enhancing human interpretability and interactivity. However, previous methods mainly employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to extract bitemporal image features. This approach often leads to an overemphasis on designing specific network architectures and limits the captured feature distributions to the current dataset, resulting in poor generalizability and robustness when applied to other datasets or real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach for remote sensing image change detection and description that integrates diffusion models, aiming to shift the focus from conventional feature learning paradigms to data distribution learning. The proposed method primarily includes a simple multi-scale change detection module, whose output features are subsequently refined using a diffusion model. Additionally, we introduce a frequency-guided complex filter module to handle high-frequency noise during the diffusion process, which helps to maintain model performance. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on several remote sensing change detection description datasets, demonstrating its superior performance.

We consider probabilistic reward machines with initially unknown dynamics, and investigate RL under the average-reward criterion, where the learning performance is assessed through the notion of regret. Our main algorithmic contribution is a model-based RL algorithm for decision processes involving probabilistic reward machines that is capable of exploiting the structure induced by such machines. We further derive high-probability and non-asymptotic bounds on its regret and demonstrate the gain in terms of regret over existing algorithms that could be applied, but obliviously to the structure. We also present a regret lower bound for the studied setting. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm constitutes the first attempt to tailor and analyze regret specifically for RL with probabilistic reward machines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phenotypic drug discovery has attracted widespread attention because of its potential to identify bioactive molecules. Transcriptomic profiling provides a comprehensive reflection of phenotypic changes in cellular responses to external perturbations. In this paper, we propose XTransferCDR, a novel generative framework designed for feature decoupling and transferable representation learning across domains. Given a pair of perturbed expression profiles, our approach decouples the perturbation representations from basal states through domain separation encoders and then cross-transfers them in the latent space. The transferred representations are then used to reconstruct the corresponding perturbed expression profiles via a shared decoder. This cross-transfer constraint effectively promotes the learning of transferable drug perturbation representations. We conducted extensive evaluations of our model on multiple datasets, including single-cell transcriptional responses to drugs and single- and combinatorial genetic perturbations. The experimental results show that XTransferCDR achieved better performance than current state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential to advance phenotypic drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasiliy A. Es'kin, Alexey O. Malkhanov, Mikhail E. Smorkalov</p>
<p>Abstract: The article discusses the development of various methods and techniques for initializing and training neural networks with a single hidden layer, as well as training a separable physics-informed neural network consisting of neural networks with a single hidden layer to solve physical problems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). A method for strictly deterministic initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer for solving physical problems described by an ODE is proposed. Modifications to existing methods for weighting the loss function are given, as well as new methods developed for training strictly deterministic-initialized neural networks to solve ODEs (detaching, additional weighting based on the second derivative, predicted solution-based weighting, relative residuals). An algorithm for physics-informed data-driven initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer is proposed. A neural network with pronounced generalizing properties is presented, whose generalizing abilities of which can be precisely controlled by adjusting network parameters. A metric for measuring the generalization of such neural network has been introduced. A gradient-free neuron-by-neuron fitting method has been developed for adjusting the parameters of a single-hidden-layer neural network, which does not require the use of an optimizer or solver for its implementation. The proposed methods have been extended to 2D problems using the separable physics-informed neural networks approach. Numerous experiments have been carried out to develop the above methods and approaches. Experiments on physical problems, such as solving various ODEs and PDEs, have demonstrated that these methods for initializing and training neural networks with one or two hidden layers (SPINN) achieve competitive accuracy and, in some cases, state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason M. Pittman</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems increasingly drive innovation across scientific fields and industry, yet challenges in compute overhead, specifically during inference, limit their scalability and sustainability. Responsible AI guardrails, essential for ensuring fairness, transparency, and privacy, further exacerbate these computational demands. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature, chiefly the lack of generalized predictive techniques for latency and energy consumption, limited cross-comparisons of classifiers, and unquantified impacts of RAI guardrails on inference performance. Using Theory Construction Methodology, this work constructed a model-agnostic theoretical framework for predicting latency and energy consumption in binary classification models during inference. The framework synthesizes classifier characteristics, dataset properties, and RAI guardrails into a unified analytical instrument. Two predictive equations are derived that capture the interplay between these factors while offering generalizability across diverse classifiers. The proposed framework provides foundational insights for designing efficient, responsible ML systems. It enables researchers to benchmark and optimize inference performance and assists practitioners in deploying scalable solutions. Finally, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for balancing computational efficiency with ethical AI principles, paving the way for future empirical validation and broader applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Bezick, Blake A. Wilson, Vaishnavi Iyer, Yuheng Chen, Vladimir M. Shalaev, Sabre Kais, Alexander V. Kildishev, Alexandra Boltasseva, Brad Lackey</p>
<p>Abstract: PearSAN is a machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm applicable to inverse design problems with large design spaces, where traditional optimizers struggle. The algorithm leverages the latent space of a generative model for rapid sampling and employs a Pearson correlated surrogate model to predict the figure of merit of the true design metric. As a showcase example, PearSAN is applied to thermophotovoltaic (TPV) metasurface design by matching the working bands between a thermal radiator and a photovoltaic cell. PearSAN can work with any pretrained generative model with a discretized latent space, making it easy to integrate with VQ-VAEs and binary autoencoders. Its novel Pearson correlational loss can be used as both a latent regularization method, similar to batch and layer normalization, and as a surrogate training loss. We compare both to previous energy matching losses, which are shown to enforce poor regularization and performance, even with upgraded affine parameters. PearSAN achieves a state-of-the-art maximum design efficiency of 97%, and is at least an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, with an improved maximum figure-of-merit gain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chathurangi Shyalika, Harleen Kaur Bagga, Ahan Bhatt, Renjith Prasad, Alaa Al Ghazo, Amit Sheth</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series foundational models (TSFM) have gained prominence in time series forecasting, promising state-of-the-art performance across various applications. However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/smtmnfg/TSFM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewhan Kim, Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Dong-Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent lightweight image captioning models using retrieved data mainly focus on text prompts. However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Grislain</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide *Large Language Models* (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows *differentially private token generation* is a viable approach to private RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugh Van Deventer, Mark Mills, August Evrard</p>
<p>Abstract: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrnaz Mofakhami, Reza Bayat, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Joao Monteiro, Valentina Zantedeschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Early Exiting (EE) is a promising technique for speeding up inference by adaptively allocating compute resources to data points based on their difficulty. The approach enables predictions to exit at earlier layers for simpler samples while reserving more computation for challenging ones. In this study, we first present a novel perspective on the EE approach, showing that larger models deployed with EE can achieve higher performance than smaller models while maintaining similar computational costs. As existing EE approaches rely on confidence estimation at each exit point, we further study the impact of overconfidence on the controllability of the compute-performance trade-off. We introduce Performance Control Early Exiting (PCEE), a method that enables accuracy thresholding by basing decisions not on a data point's confidence but on the average accuracy of samples with similar confidence levels from a held-out validation set. In our experiments, we show that PCEE offers a simple yet computationally efficient approach that provides better control over performance than standard confidence-based approaches, and allows us to scale up model sizes to yield performance gain while reducing the computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiet A. Nguyen, Adheesh Juvekar, Tianjiao Yu, Muntasir Wahed, Ismini Lourentzou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have sparked significant progress in general-purpose vision tasks through visual instruction tuning. While some works have demonstrated the capability of LVLMs to generate segmentation masks that align phrases with natural language descriptions in a single image, they struggle with segmentation-grounded comparisons across multiple images, particularly at finer granularities such as object parts. In this paper, we introduce the new task of part-focused semantic co-segmentation, which seeks to identify and segment common and unique objects and parts across images. To address this task, we present CALICO, the first LVLM that can segment and reason over multiple masks across images, enabling object comparison based on their constituent parts. CALICO features two proposed components, a novel Correspondence Extraction Module, which captures semantic-rich information to identify part-level correspondences between objects, and a Correspondence Adaptation Module, which embeds this information into the LVLM to facilitate multi-image understanding in a parameter-efficient manner. To support training and evaluation, we curate MixedParts, a comprehensive multi-image segmentation dataset containing $\sim$2.4M samples across $\sim$44K images with diverse object and part categories. Experimental results show CALICO, finetuned on only 0.3% of its architecture, achieves robust performance in part-focused semantic co-segmentation.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19340">A Reinforcement Learning-Based Task Mapping Method to Improve the Reliability of Clustered Manycores</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Hossein-Khani, Omid Akbari</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing scale of manycore systems poses significant challenges in managing reliability while meeting performance demands. Simultaneously, these systems become more susceptible to different aging mechanisms such as negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), and thermal cycling (TC), as well as the electromigration (EM) phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based task mapping method to improve the reliability of manycore systems considering the aforementioned aging mechanisms, which consists of three steps including bin packing, task-to-bin mapping, and task-to-core mapping. In the initial step, a density-based spatial application with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method is employed to compose some clusters (bins) based on the cores temperature. Then, the Q-learning algorithm is used for the two latter steps, to map the arrived task on a core such that the minimum thermal variation is occurred among all the bins. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, the proposed method is performed during runtime without requiring any parameter to be calculated offline. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated on 16, 32, and 64 cores systems using SPLASH2 and PARSEC benchmark suite applications. The results demonstrate up to 27% increase in the mean time to failure (MTTF) compared to the state-of-the-art task mapping techniques.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19346">Semi-Supervised Learning from Small Annotated Data and Large Unlabeled Data for Fine-grained PICO Entity Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyi Chen, Gongbo Zhang, Yilu Fang, Yifan Peng, Chunhua Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Extracting PICO elements -- Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes -- from clinical trial literature is essential for clinical evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Existing approaches do not distinguish the attributes of PICO entities. This study aims to develop a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract PICO entities with fine granularities.
  Materials and Methods: Using a corpus of 2,511 abstracts with PICO mentions from 4 public datasets, we developed a semi-supervised method to facilitate the training of a NER model, FinePICO, by combining limited annotated data of PICO entities and abundant unlabeled data. For evaluation, we divided the entire dataset into two subsets: a smaller group with annotations and a larger group without annotations. We then established the theoretical lower and upper performance bounds based on the performance of supervised learning models trained solely on the small, annotated subset and on the entire set with complete annotations, respectively. Finally, we evaluated FinePICO on both the smaller annotated subset and the larger, initially unannotated subset. We measured the performance of FinePICO using precision, recall, and F1.
  Results: Our method achieved precision/recall/F1 of 0.567/0.636/0.60, respectively, using a small set of annotated samples, outperforming the baseline model (F1: 0.437) by more than 16\%. The model demonstrates generalizability to a different PICO framework and to another corpus, which consistently outperforms the benchmark in diverse experimental settings (p-value \textless0.001).
  Conclusion: This study contributes a generalizable and effective semi-supervised approach to named entity recognition leveraging large unlabeled data together with small, annotated data. It also initially supports fine-grained PICO extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Terzi\'c, Michael Hersche, Giacomo Camposampiero, Thomas Hofmann, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective state-space models (SSMs) are an emerging alternative to the Transformer, offering the unique advantage of parallel training and sequential inference. Although these models have shown promising performance on a variety of tasks, their formal expressiveness and length generalization properties remain underexplored. In this work, we provide insight into the workings of selective SSMs by analyzing their expressiveness and length generalization performance on regular language tasks, i.e., finite-state automaton (FSA) emulation. We address certain limitations of modern SSM-based architectures by introducing the Selective Dense State-Space Model (SD-SSM), the first selective SSM that exhibits perfect length generalization on a set of various regular language tasks using a single layer. It utilizes a dictionary of dense transition matrices, a softmax selection mechanism that creates a convex combination of dictionary matrices at each time step, and a readout consisting of layer normalization followed by a linear map. We then proceed to evaluate variants of diagonal selective SSMs by considering their empirical performance on commutative and non-commutative automata. We explain the experimental results with theoretical considerations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/selective-dense-state-space-model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The network traffic classification allows improving the management, and the network services offer taking into account the kind of application. The future network architectures, mainly mobile networks, foresee intelligent mechanisms in their architectural frameworks to deliver application-aware network requirements. The potential of convolutional neural networks capabilities, widely exploited in several contexts, can be used in network traffic classification. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods based on the content of packets transforming it into a suitable input for CNN technologies. Hence, we implemented and evaluated the Packet Vision, a method capable of building images from packets raw-data, considering both header and payload. Our approach excels those found in state-of-the-art by delivering security and privacy by transforming the raw-data packet into images. Therefore, we built a dataset with four traffic classes evaluating the performance of three CNNs architectures: AlexNet, ResNet-18, and SqueezeNet. Experiments showcase the Packet Vision combined with CNNs applicability and suitability as a promising approach to deliver outstanding performance in classifying network traffic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts.

<p>Abstract: Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources.

<p>Abstract: We study learning of human preferences from a limited comparison feedback. This task is ubiquitous in machine learning. Its applications such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been transformational. We formulate this problem as learning a Plackett-Luce model over a universe of $N$ choices from $K$-way comparison feedback, where typically $K \ll N$. Our solution is the D-optimal design for the Plackett-Luce objective. The design defines a data logging policy that elicits comparison feedback for a small collection of optimally chosen points from all ${N \choose K}$ feasible subsets. The main algorithmic challenge in this work is that even fast methods for solving D-optimal designs would have $O({N \choose K})$ time complexity. To address this issue, we propose a randomized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm that solves the linear maximization sub-problems in the FW method on randomly chosen variables. We analyze the algorithm, and evaluate it empirically on synthetic and open-source NLP datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fumiyasu Makinoshima, Tatsuya Mitomi, Fumiya Makihara, Eigo Segawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete choice models are essential for modelling various decision-making processes in human behaviour. However, the specification of these models has depended heavily on domain knowledge from experts, and the fully automated but interpretable modelling of complex human behaviours has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we introduce the differentiable discrete choice model (Diff-DCM), a fully data-driven method for the interpretable modelling, learning, prediction, and control of complex human behaviours, which is realised by differentiable programming. Solely from input features and choice outcomes without any prior knowledge, Diff-DCM can estimate interpretable closed-form utility functions that reproduce observed behaviours. Comprehensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that Diff-DCM can be applied to various types of data and requires only a small amount of computational resources for the estimations, which can be completed within tens of seconds on a laptop without any accelerators. In these experiments, we also demonstrate that, using its differentiability, Diff-DCM can provide useful insights into human behaviours, such as an optimal intervention path for effective behavioural changes. This study provides a strong basis for the fully automated and reliable modelling, prediction, and control of human behaviours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanpeng He, Lijian Li, Tianxiang Zhan, Wenpin Jiao, Chi-Man Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a task of targeting at localizing complete action instances and categorizing them with video-level labels. Action-background ambiguity, primarily caused by background noise resulting from aggregation and intra-action variation, is a significant challenge for existing WS-TAL methods. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid multi-head attention (HMHA) module and generalized uncertainty-based evidential fusion (GUEF) module to address the problem. The proposed HMHA effectively enhances RGB and optical flow features by filtering redundant information and adjusting their feature distribution to better align with the WS-TAL task. Additionally, the proposed GUEF adaptively eliminates the interference of background noise by fusing snippet-level evidences to refine uncertainty measurement and select superior foreground feature information, which enables the model to concentrate on integral action instances to achieve better action localization and classification performance. Experimental results conducted on the THUMOS14 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Yuki Matsukiyo, Yoshihiro Yamanishi</p>
<p>Abstract: De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Revisiting PCA for Time Series Reduction in Temporal Dimension; Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen; Deep learning has significantly advanced time series analysis (TSA), enabling the extraction of complex patterns for tasks like classification, forecasting, and regression. Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanpeng He, Wenjie Song, Lijian Li, Tianxiang Zhan, Wenpin Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Capturing feature information effectively is of great importance in the field of computer vision. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), concepts like residual connection and multiple scales promote continual performance gains in diverse deep learning vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture that it consists of residual feature-reutilization inceptions (ResFRI) or split-residual feature-reutilization inceptions (Split-ResFRI). And it is composed of four convolutional combinations of different structures connected by specially designed information interaction passages, which are utilized to extract multi-scale feature information and effectively increase the receptive field of the model. Moreover, according to the network structure designed above, Split-ResFRI can adjust the segmentation ratio of the input information, thereby reducing the number of parameters and guaranteeing the model performance. Specifically, in experiments based on popular vision datasets, such as CIFAR10 ($97.94$\%), CIFAR100 ($85.91$\%) and Tiny Imagenet ($70.54$\%), we obtain state-of-the-art results compared with other modern models under the premise that the model size is approximate and no additional data is used.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks.

<p>Abstract: Helmet detection is crucial for advancing protection levels in public road traffic dynamics. This problem statement translates to an object detection task. Therefore, this paper compares recent You Only Look Once (YOLO) models in the context of helmet detection in terms of reliability and computational load. Specifically, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and the newly released YOLOv11 have been used. Besides, a modified architectural pipeline that remarkably improves the overall performance has been proposed in this manuscript. This hybridized YOLO model (h-YOLO) has been pitted against the independent models for analysis that proves h-YOLO is preferable for helmet detection over plain YOLO models. The models were tested using a range of standard object detection benchmarks such as recall, precision, and mAP (Mean Average Precision). In addition, training and testing times were recorded to provide the overall scope of the models in a real-time detection scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Bilionis, Ricardo C. Berrios, Luis Fernandez-Luque, Carlos Castillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are vital for supporting clinical decision-making in biomedical informatics. However, their predictive performance can vary across demographic groups, often due to the underrepresentation of historically marginalized populations in training datasets. The investigation reveals widespread sex- and age-related inequities in chronic disease datasets and their derived ML models. Thus, a novel analytical framework is introduced, combining systematic arbitrariness with traditional metrics like accuracy and data complexity. The analysis of data from over 25,000 individuals with chronic diseases revealed mild sex-related disparities, favoring predictive accuracy for males, and significant age-related differences, with better accuracy for younger patients. Notably, older patients showed inconsistent predictive accuracy across seven datasets, linked to higher data complexity and lower model performance. This highlights that representativeness in training data alone does not guarantee equitable outcomes, and model arbitrariness must be addressed before deploying models in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Xiangkui Cao, Zhouyu Han, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive potential across various tasks but also face significant privacy risks, limiting their practical applications. Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy awareness and leakage. Privacy awareness measures the model's ability to recognize the privacy sensitivity of input data, while privacy leakage assesses the risk of the model unintentionally disclosing privacy information in its output. We design a range of sub-tasks to thoroughly evaluate the model's privacy protection offered by LVLMs. Multi-P$^2$A covers 26 categories of personal privacy, 15 categories of trade secrets, and 18 categories of state secrets, totaling 31,962 samples. Based on Multi-P$^2$A, we evaluate the privacy preservation capabilities of 21 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs. Our results reveal that current LVLMs generally pose a high risk of facilitating privacy breaches, with vulnerabilities varying across personal privacy, trade secret, and state secret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyao Li, Yingchun Hu, Xuefei Ning, Xihui Liu, Ke Hong, Xiaotao Jia, Xiuhong Li, Yaqi Yan, Pei Ran, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Cho, Sung Woong Cho, Hyeontae Jo, Hyung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential equations (DEs) are crucial for modeling the evolution of natural or engineered systems. Traditionally, the parameters in DEs are adjusted to fit data from system observations. However, in fields such as politics, economics, and biology, available data are often independently collected at distinct time points from different subjects (i.e., repeated cross-sectional (RCS) data). Conventional optimization techniques struggle to accurately estimate DE parameters when RCS data exhibit various heterogeneities, leading to a significant loss of information. To address this issue, we propose a new estimation method called the emulator-informed deep-generative model (EIDGM), designed to handle RCS data. Specifically, EIDGM integrates a physics-informed neural network-based emulator that immediately generates DE solutions and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based parameter generator that can effectively mimic the RCS data. We evaluated EIDGM on exponential growth, logistic population models, and the Lorenz system, demonstrating its superior ability to accurately capture parameter distributions. Additionally, we applied EIDGM to an experimental dataset of Amyloid beta 40 and beta 42, successfully capturing diverse parameter distribution shapes. This shows that EIDGM can be applied to model a wide range of systems and extended to uncover the operating principles of systems based on limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichen Yu, Ziyan Yang, Shanchuan Lin, Qi Zhao, Jianyi Wang, Liangke Gui, Matt Fredrikson, Lu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, a prevalent training technique involves utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) for image re-captioning. Even though VLMs are known to exhibit hallucination, generating descriptive content that deviates from the visual reality, the ramifications of such caption hallucinations on T2I generation performance remain under-explored. Through our empirical investigation, we first establish a comprehensive dataset comprising VLM-generated captions, and then systematically analyze how caption hallucination influences generation outcomes. Our findings reveal that (1) the disparities in caption quality persistently impact model outputs during fine-tuning. (2) VLMs confidence scores serve as reliable indicators for detecting and characterizing noise-related patterns in the data distribution. (3) even subtle variations in caption fidelity have significant effects on the quality of learned representations. These findings collectively emphasize the profound impact of caption quality on model performance and highlight the need for more sophisticated robust training algorithm in T2I. In response to these observations, we propose a approach leveraging VLM confidence score to mitigate caption noise, thereby enhancing the robustness of T2I models against hallucination in caption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research in subject-driven generation increasingly emphasizes the importance of selective subject features. Nevertheless, accurately selecting the content in a given reference image still poses challenges, especially when selecting the similar subjects in an image (e.g., two different dogs). Some methods attempt to use text prompts or pixel masks to isolate specific elements. However, text prompts often fall short in precisely describing specific content, and pixel masks are often expensive. To address this, we introduce P3S-Diffusion, a novel architecture designed for context-selected subject-driven generation via point supervision. P3S-Diffusion leverages minimal cost label (e.g., points) to generate subject-driven images. During fine-tuning, it can generate an expanded base mask from these points, obviating the need for additional segmentation models. The mask is employed for inpainting and aligning with subject representation. The P3S-Diffusion preserves fine features of the subjects through Multi-layers Condition Injection. Enhanced by the Attention Consistency Loss for improved training, extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent feature preservation and image generation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: To improve the efficiency of warehousing system and meet huge customer orders, we aim to solve the challenges of dimension disaster and dynamic properties in hyper scale multi-robot task planning (MRTP) for robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS). Existing research indicates that hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is an effective method to reduce these challenges. Based on that, we construct an efficient multi-stage HRL-based multi-robot task planner for hyper scale MRTP in RMFS, and the planning process is represented with a special temporal graph topology. To ensure optimality, the planner is designed with a centralized architecture, but it also brings the challenges of scaling up and generalization that require policies to maintain performance for various unlearned scales and maps. To tackle these difficulties, we first construct a hierarchical temporal attention network (HTAN) to ensure basic ability of handling inputs with unfixed lengths, and then design multi-stage curricula for hierarchical policy learning to further improve the scaling up and generalization ability while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we notice that policies with hierarchical structure suffer from unfair credit assignment that is similar to that in multi-agent reinforcement learning, inspired of which, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm with counterfactual rollout baseline to improve learning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our planner outperform other state-of-the-art methods on various MRTP instances in both simulated and real-world RMFS. Also, our planner can successfully scale up to hyper scale MRTP instances in RMFS with up to 200 robots and 1000 retrieval racks on unlearned maps while keeping superior performance over other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) understanding aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines. Data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic parsing, which converts natural language questions into logic forms, plays a crucial role in reasoning within structured environments. However, existing methods encounter two significant challenges: reliance on extensive manually annotated datasets and limited generalization capability to unseen examples. To tackle these issues, we propose Targeted Synthetic Data Generation (TARGA), a practical framework that dynamically generates high-relevance synthetic data without manual annotation. Starting from the pertinent entities and relations of a given question, we probe for the potential relevant queries through layer-wise expansion and cross-layer combination. Then we generate corresponding natural language questions for these constructed queries to jointly serve as the synthetic demonstrations for in-context learning. Experiments on multiple knowledge base question answering (KBQA) datasets demonstrate that TARGA, using only a 7B-parameter model, substantially outperforms existing non-fine-tuned methods that utilize close-sourced model, achieving notable improvements in F1 scores on GrailQA(+7.7) and KBQA-Agent(+12.2). Furthermore, TARGA also exhibits superior sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities under non-I.I.D. settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shixuan Liu, Yanghe Feng, Keyu Wu, Guangquan Cheng, Jincai Huang, Zhong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In many domains of empirical sciences, discovering the causal structure within variables remains an indispensable task. Recently, to tackle with unoriented edges or latent assumptions violation suffered by conventional methods, researchers formulated a reinforcement learning (RL) procedure for causal discovery, and equipped REINFORCE algorithm to search for the best-rewarded directed acyclic graph. The two keys to the overall performance of the procedure are the robustness of RL methods and the efficient encoding of variables. However, on the one hand, REINFORCE is prone to local convergence and unstable performance during training. Neither trust region policy optimization, being computationally-expensive, nor proximal policy optimization (PPO), suffering from aggregate constraint deviation, is decent alternative for combinatory optimization problems with considerable individual subactions. We propose a trust region-navigated clipping policy optimization method for causal discovery that guarantees both better search efficiency and steadiness in policy optimization, in comparison with REINFORCE, PPO and our prioritized sampling-guided REINFORCE implementation. On the other hand, to boost the efficient encoding of variables, we propose a refined graph attention encoder called SDGAT that can grasp more feature information without priori neighbourhood information. With these improvements, the proposed method outperforms former RL method in both synthetic and benchmark datasets in terms of output results and optimization robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drug-target interaction is fundamental in understanding how drugs affect biological systems, and accurately predicting drug-target affinity (DTA) is vital for drug discovery. Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a significant approach for estimating the binding strength between drugs and target proteins. However, existing methods simply utilize the drug's local information from molecular topology rather than global information. Additionally, the features of drugs and proteins are usually fused with a simple concatenation operation, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we proposed ViDTA, an enhanced DTA prediction framework. We introduce virtual nodes into the Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based drug feature extraction network, which acts as a global memory to exchange messages more efficiently. By incorporating virtual graph nodes, we seamlessly integrate local and global features of drug molecular structures, expanding the GNN's receptive field. Additionally, we propose an attention-based linear feature fusion network for better capturing the interaction information between drugs and proteins. Experimental results evaluated on various benchmarks including Davis, Metz, and KIBA demonstrate that our proposed ViDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Rao Marpally, Pranav Goyal, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: Current social navigation methods and benchmarks primarily focus on proxemics and task efficiency. While these factors are important, qualitative aspects such as perceptions of a robot's social competence are equally crucial for successful adoption and integration into human environments. We propose a more comprehensive evaluation of social navigation through scenario-based testing, where specific human-robot interaction scenarios can reveal key robot behaviors. However, creating such scenarios is often labor-intensive and complex. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a pipeline that automates the generation of context-, and location-appropriate social navigation scenarios, ready for simulation. Our pipeline transforms simple scenario metadata into detailed textual scenarios, infers pedestrian and robot trajectories, and simulates pedestrian behaviors, which enables more controlled evaluation. We leverage the social reasoning and code-generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline scenario generation and translation. Our experiments show that our pipeline produces realistic scenarios and significantly improves scenario translation over naive LLM prompting. Additionally, we present initial feedback from a usability study with social navigation experts and a case-study demonstrating a scenario-based evaluation of three navigation algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Avni, Martin Kure\v{c}ka, Kaushik Mallik, Petr Novotn\'y, Suman Sadhukhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph games are fundamental in strategic reasoning of multi-agent systems and their environments. We study a new family of graph games which combine stochastic environmental uncertainties and auction-based interactions among the agents, formalized as bidding games on (finite) Markov decision processes (MDP). Normally, on MDPs, a single decision-maker chooses a sequence of actions, producing a probability distribution over infinite paths. In bidding games on MDPs, two players -- called the reachability and safety players -- bid for the privilege of choosing the next action at each step. The reachability player's goal is to maximize the probability of reaching a target vertex, whereas the safety player's goal is to minimize it. These games generalize traditional bidding games on graphs, and the existing analysis techniques do not extend. For instance, the central property of traditional bidding games is the existence of a threshold budget, which is a necessary and sufficient budget to guarantee winning for the reachability player. For MDPs, the threshold becomes a relation between the budgets and probabilities of reaching the target. We devise value-iteration algorithms that approximate thresholds and optimal policies for general MDPs, and compute the exact solutions for acyclic MDPs, and show that finding thresholds is at least as hard as solving simple-stochastic games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-Hong Huang, Yixian Shen, Hongyi Zhu, Stevan Rudinac, Evangelos Kanoulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, but the escalating demands on computational resources pose significant challenges, particularly in the extensive utilization of full fine-tuning for downstream tasks. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full fine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce Gradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach that enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to improve gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during optimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight and gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer memory usage by up to 89.5% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional inference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods in fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all GLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65, surpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a promising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning.

<p>Abstract: Event-based cameras are sensors that simulate the human eye, offering advantages such as high-speed robustness and low power consumption. Established Deep Learning techniques have shown effectiveness in processing event data. Chimera is a Block-Based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework specifically designed for Event-Based Object Detection, aiming to create a systematic approach for adapting RGB-domain processing methods to the event domain. The Chimera design space is constructed from various macroblocks, including Attention blocks, Convolutions, State Space Models, and MLP-mixer-based architectures, which provide a valuable trade-off between local and global processing capabilities, as well as varying levels of complexity. The results on the PErson Detection in Robotics (PEDRo) dataset demonstrated performance levels comparable to leading state-of-the-art models, alongside an average parameter reduction of 1.6 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Wang, Cailian Chen, Xinyi Le, Qimin Xu, Lei Xu, Yanzhou Zhang, Jie Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingchun Lian, Lingyu Liu, Yaxiong Wang, Yujiao Wu, Li Zhu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jana Zakall, Birgit Pohn, Antonia Graf, Daniel Kovatchki, Arezoo Borji, Ragib Shahriar Islam, Hossam Haick, Heinz Strohmer, Sepideh Hatamikia</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance decision-making and optimize treatment protocols in in vitro fertilization (IVF). In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting decision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This review evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with medical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and current limitations. Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that, reveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting optimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the medical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size and number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image analysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced image analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper insights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key factors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on single-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of their findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced imaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the importance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets. Addressing these gaps has the potential to enhance ovarian stimulation management, paving the way for efficient, personalized, and data-driven treatment pathways that improve IVF outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploit the vulnerabilities of convolutional neural networks by introducing imperceptible perturbations that lead to misclassifications, exposing weaknesses in feature representations and decision boundaries. This paper presents a novel framework combining supervised contrastive learning and margin-based contrastive loss to enhance adversarial robustness. Supervised contrastive learning improves the structure of the feature space by clustering embeddings of samples within the same class and separating those from different classes. Margin-based contrastive loss, inspired by support vector machines, enforces explicit constraints to create robust decision boundaries with well-defined margins. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset with a ResNet-18 backbone demonstrate robustness performance improvements in adversarial accuracy under Fast Gradient Sign Method attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Kneip, Martin Lefebvre, Pol Maistriaux, David Bol</p>
<p>Abstract: Charge-domain compute-in-memory (CIM) SRAMs have recently become an enticing compromise between computing efficiency and accuracy to process sub-8b convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the edge. Yet, they commonly make use of a fixed dot-product (DP) voltage swing, which leads to a loss in effective ADC bits due to data-dependent clipping or truncation effects that waste precious conversion energy and computing accuracy. To overcome this, we present IMAGINE, a workload-adaptive 1-to-8b CIM-CNN accelerator in 22nm FD-SOI. It introduces a 1152x256 end-to-end charge-based macro with a multi-bit DP based on an input-serial, weight-parallel accumulation that avoids power-hungry DACs. An adaptive swing is achieved by combining a channel-wise DP array split with a linear in-ADC implementation of analog batch-normalization (ABN), obtaining a distribution-aware data reshaping. Critical design constraints are relaxed by including the post-silicon equivalent noise within a CIM-aware CNN training framework. Measurement results showcase an 8b system-level energy efficiency of 40TOPS/W at 0.3/0.6V, with competitive accuracies on MNIST and CIFAR-10. Moreover, the peak energy and area efficiencies of the 187kB/mm2 macro respectively reach up to 0.15-8POPS/W and 2.6-154TOPS/mm2, scaling with the 8-to-1b computing precision. These results exceed previous charge-based designs by 3-to-5x while being the first work to provide linear in-memory rescaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elina M\"akel\"a, Fabian Stephany</p>
<p>Abstract: The question of whether AI substitutes or complements human work is central to debates on the future of work. This paper examines the impact of AI on skill demand and compensation in the U.S. economy, analysing 12 million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2023. It investigates internal effects (within-job substitution and complementation) and external effects (across occupations, industries, and regions). Our findings reveal a significant increase in demand for AI-complementary skills, such as digital literacy, teamwork, and resilience, alongside rising wage premiums for these skills in AI roles like Data Scientist. Conversely, substitute skills, including customer service and text review, have declined in both demand and value within AI-related positions. Examining external effects, we find a notable rise in demand for complementary skills in non-AI roles linked to the growth of AI-related jobs in specific industries or regions. At the same time, there is a moderate decline in non-AI roles requiring substitute skills. Overall, AI's complementary effect is up to 50% larger than its substitution effect, resulting in net positive demand for skills. These results, replicated for the UK and Australia, highlight AI's transformative impact on workforce skill requirements. They suggest reskilling efforts should prioritise not only technical AI skills but also complementary skills like ethics and digital literacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noel Brindise, Cedric Langbort</p>
<p>Abstract: The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data augmentation methods are commonly integrated into the training of anomaly detection models. Previous approaches have primarily focused on replicating real-world anomalies or enhancing diversity, without considering that the standard of anomaly varies across different classes, potentially leading to a biased training distribution. This paper analyzes crucial traits of simulated anomalies that contribute to the training of reconstructive networks and condenses them into several methods, thus creating a comprehensive framework by selectively utilizing appropriate combinations. Furthermore, we integrate this framework with a reconstruction-based approach and concurrently propose a split training strategy that alleviates the issue of overfitting while avoiding introducing interference to the reconstruction process. The evaluations conducted on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of object classes. To evaluate generalizability, we generate a simulated dataset comprising anomalies with diverse characteristics since the original test samples only include specific types of anomalies and may lead to biased evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits promising potential for generalizing effectively to various unforeseen anomalies encountered in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling and control of the human musculoskeletal system is important for understanding human motor functions, developing embodied intelligence, and optimizing human-robot interaction systems. However, current human musculoskeletal models are restricted to a limited range of body parts and often with a reduced number of muscles. There is also a lack of algorithms capable of controlling over 600 muscles to generate reasonable human movements. To fill this gap, we build a musculoskeletal model (MS-Human-700) with 90 body segments, 206 joints, and 700 muscle-tendon units, allowing simulation of full-body dynamics and interaction with various devices. We develop a new algorithm using low-dimensional representation and hierarchical deep reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art full-body control. We validate the effectiveness of our model and algorithm in simulations with real human locomotion data. The musculoskeletal model, along with its control algorithm, will be made available to the research community to promote a deeper understanding of human motion control and better design of interactive robots.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital that simulates the entire process of treating illness. All patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the key challenges in current Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Automated Driving (AD) agents is achieving flexible, precise, and human-like behavior cost-effectively. This paper introduces an innovative approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to intuitively and effectively optimize RL reward functions in a human-centric way. We developed a framework where instructions and dynamic environment descriptions are input into the LLM. The LLM then utilizes this information to assist in generating rewards, thereby steering the behavior of RL agents towards patterns that more closely resemble human driving. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only makes RL agents more anthropomorphic but also achieves better performance. Additionally, various strategies for reward-proxy and reward-shaping are investigated, revealing the significant impact of prompt design on shaping an AD vehicle's behavior. These findings offer a promising direction for the development of more advanced, human-like automated driving systems. Our experimental data and source code can be found here</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhee Cho, Jihoon Kim, Daseul Bae, Jinho Choo, Youngjune Gwon, Yeong-Dae Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Software robots have long been used in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate mundane and repetitive computer tasks. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their advanced reasoning capabilities, these agents are now able to handle more complex or previously unseen tasks. However, LLM-based automation techniques in recent literature frequently rely on HTML source code for input or application-specific API calls for actions, limiting their applicability to specific environments. We propose an LLM-based agent that mimics human behavior in solving computer tasks. It perceives its environment solely through screenshot images, which are then converted into text for an LLM to process. By leveraging the reasoning capability of the LLM, we eliminate the need for large-scale human demonstration data typically required for model training. The agent only executes keyboard and mouse operations on Graphical User Interface (GUI), removing the need for pre-provided APIs to function. To further enhance the agent's performance in this setting, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Context-Aware Action Planning (CAAP) prompting, which enables the agent to thoroughly examine the task context from multiple perspectives. Our agent achieves an average success rate of 94.5% on MiniWoB++ and an average task score of 62.3 on WebShop, outperforming all previous studies of agents that rely solely on screen images. This method demonstrates potential for broader applications, particularly for tasks requiring coordination across multiple applications on desktops or smartphones, marking a significant advancement in the field of automation agents.

<p>Abstract: The problem of using structured methods to represent knowledge is well-known in conceptual modeling and has been studied for many years. It has been proven that adopting modeling patterns represents an effective structural method. Patterns are, indeed, generalizable recurrent structures that can be exploited as solutions to design problems. They aid in understanding and improving the process of creating models. The undeniable value of using patterns in conceptual modeling was demonstrated in several experimental studies. However, discovering patterns in conceptual models is widely recognized as a highly complex task and a systematic solution to pattern identification is currently lacking. In this paper, we propose a general approach to the problem of discovering frequent structures, as they occur in conceptual modeling languages. As proof of concept, we implement our approach by focusing on two widely-used conceptual modeling languages. This implementation includes an exploratory tool that integrates a frequent subgraph mining algorithm with graph manipulation techniques. The tool processes multiple conceptual models and identifies recurrent structures based on various criteria. We validate the tool using two state-of-the-art curated datasets: one consisting of models encoded in OntoUML and the other in ArchiMate. The primary objective of our approach is to provide a support tool for language engineers. This tool can be used to identify both effective and ineffective modeling practices, enabling the refinement and evolution of conceptual modeling languages. Furthermore, it facilitates the reuse of accumulated expertise, ultimately supporting the creation of higher-quality models in a given language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maayan Orner, Oleg Maksimov, Akiva Kleinerman, Charles Ortiz, Sarit Kraus</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, agents have become capable of communicating seamlessly via natural language and navigating in environments that involve cooperation and competition, a fact that can introduce social dilemmas. Due to the interleaving of cooperation and competition, understanding agents' decision-making in such environments is challenging, and humans can benefit from obtaining explanations. However, such environments and scenarios have rarely been explored in the context of explainable AI. While some explanation methods for cooperative environments can be applied in mixed-motive setups, they do not address inter-agent competition, cheap-talk, or implicit communication by actions. In this work, we design explanation methods to address these issues. Then, we proceed to establish generality and demonstrate the applicability of the methods to three games with vastly different properties. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the methods for humans in two mixed-motive games. The first is a challenging 7-player game called no-press Diplomacy. The second is a 3-player game inspired by the prisoner's dilemma, featuring communication in natural language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanhu Wang, Muhammad Muzammil Afzal, Zhengyang Li, Jie Zhou, Chenyuan Feng, Shuaishuai Guo, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. Furthermore, our proposed framework incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the system's ability to acquire domain-specific knowledge and generate solutions, thereby enabling the customization and optimization of the BSS process. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. This research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes three different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Kosuke Nishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent concept-based interpretable models have succeeded in providing meaningful explanations by pre-defined concept sets. However, the dependency on the pre-defined concepts restricts the application because of the limited number of concepts for explanations. This paper proposes a novel interpretable deep neural network called explanation bottleneck models (XBMs). XBMs generate a text explanation from the input without pre-defined concepts and then predict a final task prediction based on the generated explanation by leveraging pre-trained vision-language encoder-decoder models. To achieve both the target task performance and the explanation quality, we train XBMs through the target task loss with the regularization penalizing the explanation decoder via the distillation from the frozen pre-trained decoder. Our experiments, including a comparison to state-of-the-art concept bottleneck models, confirm that XBMs provide accurate and fluent natural language explanations without pre-defined concept sets.

<p>Abstract: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Baichuan-omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muzhi Li, Cehao Yang, Chengjin Xu, Zixing Song, Xuhui Jiang, Jian Guo, Ho-fung Leung, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples with unseen entities. Recent works focus on modeling reasoning paths between the head and tail entity as direct supporting evidence. However, these methods depend heavily on the existence and quality of reasoning paths, which limits their general applicability in different scenarios. In addition, we observe that latent type constraints and neighboring facts inherent in KGs are also vital in inferring missing triples. To effectively utilize all useful information in KGs, we introduce CATS, a novel context-aware inductive KGC solution. With sufficient guidance from proper prompts and supervised fine-tuning, CATS activates the strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models to assess the existence of query triples, which consist of two modules. First, the type-aware reasoning module evaluates whether the candidate entity matches the latent entity type as required by the query relation. Then, the subgraph reasoning module selects relevant reasoning paths and neighboring facts, and evaluates their correlation to the query triple. Experiment results on three widely used datasets demonstrate that CATS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 16 out of 18 transductive, inductive, and few-shot settings with an average absolute MRR improvement of 7.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Ang Cheng, Ivan Felipe Rodriguez, Sixuan Chen, Kohitij Kar, Takeo Watanabe, Thomas Serre</p>
<p>Abstract: Current neural network models of primate vision focus on replicating overall levels of behavioral accuracy, often neglecting perceptual decisions' rich, dynamic nature. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework to model the dynamics of human behavioral choices by learning to align the temporal dynamics of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to human reaction times (RTs). We describe an approximation that allows us to constrain the number of time steps an RNN takes to solve a task with human RTs. The approach is extensively evaluated against various psychophysics experiments. We also show that the approximation can be used to optimize an "ideal-observer" RNN model to achieve an optimal tradeoff between speed and accuracy without human data. The resulting model is found to account well for human RT data. Finally, we use the approximation to train a deep learning implementation of the popular Wong-Wang decision-making model. The model is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model of visual processing and evaluated using both artificial and natural image stimuli. Overall, we present a novel framework that helps align current vision models with human behavior, bringing us closer to an integrated model of human vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaeyun Jang, Hyungi Lee, Jungtaek Kim, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a widely adopted technique known for its adaptability and reliability across various domains. Despite its conceptual simplicity, fine-tuning entails several troublesome engineering choices, such as selecting hyperparameters and determining checkpoints from an optimization trajectory. To tackle the difficulty of choosing the best model, one effective solution is model fusion, which combines multiple models in a parameter space. However, we observe a large discrepancy between loss and metric landscapes during the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. Building on this observation, we introduce a novel model fusion technique that optimizes both the desired metric and loss through multi-objective Bayesian optimization. In addition, to effectively select hyperparameters, we establish a two-stage procedure by integrating Bayesian optimization processes into our framework. Experiments across various downstream tasks show considerable performance improvements using our Bayesian optimization-guided method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyi Wang, Jianheng Liu, Bryan Lee, Zhihao Wu, Yu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanxiang Hu, Qiyu Li, Anze Xie, Nan Jiang, Ion Stoica, Haojian Jin, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhe Liang, Wei Zhang, Tianyang Zhong, Tianming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview on the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in mathematical research, highlighting the transformative role AI has begun to play in this domain. Traditionally, AI advancements have heavily relied on theoretical foundations provided by mathematics and statistics. However, recent developments in AI, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential for AI to contribute back to mathematics by offering flexible algorithmic frameworks and powerful inductive reasoning capabilities that support various aspects of mathematical research. This survey aims to establish a bridge between AI and mathematics, providing insights into the mutual benefits and fostering deeper interdisciplinary understanding.
  In particular, we argue that while current AI and LLMs may struggle with complex deductive reasoning, their "inherent creativity", the ability to generate outputs at high throughput based on recognition of shallow patterns, holds significant potential to support and inspire mathematical research. This creative capability, often overlooked, could be the key to unlocking new perspectives and methodologies in mathematics. Furthermore, we address the lack of cross-disciplinary communication: mathematicians may not fully comprehend the latest advances in AI, while AI researchers frequently prioritize benchmark performance over real-world applications in frontier mathematical research. This paper seeks to close that gap, offering a detailed exploration of AI fundamentals, its strengths, and its emerging applications in the mathematical sciences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Systems thinking provides us with a way to model the algorithmic fairness problem by allowing us to encode prior knowledge and assumptions about where we believe bias might exist in the data generating process. We can then model this using a series of causal graphs, enabling us to link AI/ML systems to politics and the law. By treating the fairness problem as a complex system, we can combine techniques from machine learning, causal inference, and system dynamics. Each of these analytical techniques is designed to capture different emergent aspects of fairness, allowing us to develop a deeper and more holistic view of the problem. This can help policymakers on both sides of the political aisle to understand the complex trade-offs that exist from different types of fairness policies, providing a blueprint for designing AI policy that is aligned to their political agendas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes M\"akelburg, Yiwen Peng, Mehwish Alam, Tobias Weller, Maribel Acosta</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the vast amount of information encoded in Knowledge Graphs (KGs), information about the class affiliation of entities remains often incomplete. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been shown to be effective predictors of complete information about the class affiliation of entities in KGs. However, these models do not learn the class affiliation of entities in KGs incorporating the complexity of the task, which negatively affects the models prediction capabilities. To address this problem, we introduce a Markov process-based architecture into well-known GCN architectures. This end-to-end network learns the prediction of class affiliation of entities in KGs within a Markov process. The number of computational steps is learned during training using a geometric distribution. At the same time, the loss function combines insights from the field of evidential learning. The experiments show a performance improvement over existing models in several studied architectures and datasets. Based on the chosen hyperparameters for the geometric distribution, the expected number of computation steps can be adjusted to improve efficiency and accuracy during training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption. Code will be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Hyeon-Woo, Kim Yu-Ji, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han, Seong Joon Oh, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: The favorable performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is often attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA). The MSA enables global interactions at each layer of a ViT model, which is a contrasting feature against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that gradually increase the range of interaction across multiple layers. We study the role of the density of the attention. Our preliminary analyses suggest that the spatial interactions of attention maps are close to dense interactions rather than sparse ones. This is a curious phenomenon, as dense attention maps are harder for the model to learn due to steeper softmax gradients around them. We interpret this as a strong preference for ViT models to include dense interaction. We thus manually insert the uniform attention to each layer of ViT models to supply the much needed dense interactions. We call this method Context Broadcasting, CB. We observe that the inclusion of CB reduces the degree of density in the original attention maps and increases both the capacity and generalizability of the ViT models. CB incurs negligible costs: 1 line in your model code, no additional parameters, and minimal extra operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Chen, Chenghua Guo, Rufeng Chen, Guixiang Ma, Ming Zeng, Xiangwen Liao, Xi Zhang, Sihong Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: To foster trust in machine learning models, explanations must be faithful and stable for consistent insights. Existing relevant works rely on the $\ell_p$ distance for stability assessment, which diverges from human perception. Besides, existing adversarial training (AT) associated with intensive computations may lead to an arms race. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel metric to assess the stability of top-$k$ salient features. We introduce R2ET which trains for stable explanation by efficient and effective regularizer, and analyze R2ET by multi-objective optimization to prove numerical and statistical stability of explanations. Moreover, theoretical connections between R2ET and certified robustness justify R2ET's stability in all attacks. Extensive experiments across various data modalities and model architectures show that R2ET achieves superior stability against stealthy attacks, and generalizes effectively across different explanation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Zhu, Xiaohan Wang, Jing Chen, Shuofei Qiao, Yixin Ou, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for training generalisable models on large-scale data in the fields of vision, text, and speech. Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation - Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiao Ma, Jiayi Pan, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to connect language units to their referents in the physical world, referred to as grounding, is crucial to learning and understanding grounded meanings of words. While humans demonstrate fast mapping in new word learning, it remains unclear whether modern vision-language models can truly represent language with their grounded meanings and how grounding may further bootstrap new word learning. To this end, we introduce Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition (GOVA) to examine grounding and bootstrapping in open-world language learning. As an initial attempt, we propose object-oriented BERT (OctoBERT), a novel visually-grounded language model by pre-training on image-text pairs highlighting grounding as an objective. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that OctoBERT is a more coherent and fast grounded word learner, and that the grounding ability acquired during pre-training helps the model to learn unseen words more rapidly and robustly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Liyuan Zhang, Chen Gao, Yong Li, Tao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Membership Inference Attack (MIA) identifies whether a record exists in a machine learning model's training set by querying the model. MIAs on the classic classification models have been well-studied, and recent works have started to explore how to transplant MIA onto generative models. Our investigation indicates that existing MIAs designed for generative models mainly depend on the overfitting in target models. However, overfitting can be avoided by employing various regularization techniques, whereas existing MIAs demonstrate poor performance in practice. Unlike overfitting, memorization is essential for deep learning models to attain optimal performance, making it a more prevalent phenomenon. Memorization in generative models leads to an increasing trend in the probability distribution of generating records around the member record. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Fluctuation Assessing Membership Inference Attack (PFAMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by detecting these trends via analyzing the overall probabilistic fluctuations around given records. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple generative models and datasets, which demonstrate PFAMI can improve the attack success rate (ASR) by about 27.9% when compared with the best baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfredo Petrella, Marco Miozzo, Paolo Dini</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic prediction represents one of the crucial tasks for smartly optimizing the mobile network. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attracted attention to solve this problem thanks to its ability in cognizing the state of the mobile network and make intelligent decisions. Research on this topic has concentrated on making predictions in a centralized fashion, i.e., by collecting data from the different network elements and process them in a cloud center. This translates into inefficiencies due to the large amount of data transmissions and computations required, leading to high energy consumption. In this work, we investigate a fully decentralized AI solution for mobile traffic prediction that allows data to be kept locally, reducing energy consumption through collaboration among the base station sites. To do so, we propose a novel prediction framework based on edge computing and Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) techniques, using datasets obtained at the edge through a large measurement campaign. Two main Deep Learning architectures are designed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and tested under different training conditions. Simulation results show that the CNN architectures outperform the RNNs in accuracy and consume less energy. In both scenarios, DTL contributes to an accuracy enhancement in 85% of the examined cases compared to their stand-alone counterparts. Additionally, DTL significantly reduces computational complexity and energy consumption during training, resulting in a reduction of the energy footprint by 60% for CNNs and 90% for RNNs. Finally, two cutting-edge eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques are employed to interpret the derived learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiao Ma, Jacob Sansom, Run Peng, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated considerable interest and debate regarding their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM). Several recent inquiries reveal a lack of robust ToM in these models and pose a pressing demand to develop new benchmarks, as current ones primarily focus on different aspects of ToM and are prone to shortcuts and data leakage. In this position paper, we seek to answer two road-blocking questions: (1) How can we taxonomize a holistic landscape of machine ToM? (2) What is a more effective evaluation protocol for machine ToM? Following psychological studies, we taxonomize machine ToM into 7 mental state categories and delineate existing benchmarks to identify under-explored aspects of ToM. We argue for a holistic and situated evaluation of ToM to break ToM into individual components and treat LLMs as an agent who is physically situated in environments and socially situated in interactions with humans. Such situated evaluation provides a more comprehensive assessment of mental states and potentially mitigates the risk of shortcuts and data leakage. We further present a pilot study in a grid world setup as a proof of concept. We hope this position paper can facilitate future research to integrate ToM with LLMs and offer an intuitive means for researchers to better position their work in the landscape of ToM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Kirilenko, Vitaliy Vorobyov, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric architectures usually apply a differentiable module to the entire feature map to decompose it into sets of entity representations called slots. Some of these methods structurally resemble clustering algorithms, where the cluster's center in latent space serves as a slot representation. Slot Attention is an example of such a method, acting as a learnable analog of the soft k-means algorithm. Our work employs a learnable clustering method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model. Unlike other approaches, we represent slots not only as centers of clusters but also incorporate information about the distance between clusters and assigned vectors, leading to more expressive slot representations. Our experiments demonstrate that using this approach instead of Slot Attention improves performance in object-centric scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results in the set property prediction task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their powerful ability in natural language understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Limoyo, Abhisek Konar, Trevor Ablett, Jonathan Kelly, Francois R. Hogan, Gregory Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: We present placing via picking (PvP), a method to autonomously collect real-world demonstrations for a family of placing tasks in which objects must be manipulated to specific, contact-constrained locations. With PvP, we approach the collection of robotic object placement demonstrations by reversing the grasping process and exploiting the inherent symmetry of the pick and place problems. Specifically, we obtain placing demonstrations from a set of grasp sequences of objects initially located at their target placement locations. Our system can collect hundreds of demonstrations in contact-constrained environments without human intervention using two modules: compliant control for grasping and tactile regrasping. We train a policy directly from visual observations through behavioural cloning, using the autonomously-collected demonstrations. By doing so, the policy can generalize to object placement scenarios outside of the training environment without privileged information (e.g., placing a plate picked up from a table). We validate our approach in home robot scenarios that include dishwasher loading and table setting. Our approach yields robotic placing policies that outperform policies trained with kinesthetic teaching, both in terms of success rate and data efficiency, while requiring no human supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Xiu Su, Yu Han, Shan You, Tao Huang, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various generative tasks with the predictive prowess of denoising model. Currently, diffusion models employ a uniform denoising model across all timesteps. However, the inherent variations in data distributions at different timesteps lead to conflicts during training, constraining the potential of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage divide-and-conquer training strategy termed TDC Training. It groups timesteps based on task similarity and difficulty, assigning highly customized denoising models to each group, thereby enhancing the performance of diffusion models. While two-stage training avoids the need to train each model separately, the total training cost is even lower than training a single unified denoising model. Additionally, we introduce Proxy-based Pruning to further customize the denoising models. This method transforms the pruning problem of diffusion models into a multi-round decision-making problem, enabling precise pruning of diffusion models. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of TDC Training, demonstrating improvements in FID of 1.5 on ImageNet64 compared to original IDDPM, while saving about 20\% of computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Limoyo, Jimmy Li, Dmitriy Rivkin, Jonathan Kelly, Gregory Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Holistic and Multi-Granular Surgical Scene Understanding of Prostatectomies (GraSP) dataset, a curated benchmark that models surgical scene understanding as a hierarchy of complementary tasks with varying levels of granularity. Our approach encompasses long-term tasks, such as surgical phase and step recognition, and short-term tasks, including surgical instrument segmentation and atomic visual actions detection. To exploit our proposed benchmark, we introduce the Transformers for Actions, Phases, Steps, and Instrument Segmentation (TAPIS) model, a general architecture that combines a global video feature extractor with localized region proposals from an instrument segmentation model to tackle the multi-granularity of our benchmark. Through extensive experimentation in ours and alternative benchmarks, we demonstrate TAPIS's versatility and state-of-the-art performance across different tasks. This work represents a foundational step forward in Endoscopic Vision, offering a novel framework for future research towards holistic surgical scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimrod Berman, Eitan Kosman, Dotan Di Castro, Omri Azencot</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph generation is integral to various engineering and scientific disciplines. Nevertheless, existing methodologies tend to overlook the generation of edge attributes. However, we identify critical applications where edge attributes are essential, making prior methods potentially unsuitable in such contexts. Moreover, while trivial adaptations are available, empirical investigations reveal their limited efficacy as they do not properly model the interplay among graph components. To address this, we propose a joint score-based model of nodes and edges for graph generation that considers all graph components. Our approach offers three key novelties: \textbf{(1)} node and edge attributes are combined in an attention module that generates samples based on the two ingredients, \textbf{(2)} node, edge and adjacency information are mutually dependent during the graph diffusion process, and \textbf{(3)} the framework enables the generation of graphs with rich attributes along the edges, providing a more expressive formulation for generative tasks than existing works. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks involving real-world and synthetic datasets in which edge features are crucial. Additionally, we introduce a new synthetic dataset that incorporates edge values. Furthermore, we propose a novel application that greatly benefits from the method due to its nature: the generation of traffic scenes represented as graphs. Our method outperforms other graph generation methods, demonstrating a significant advantage in edge-related measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradip Chakraborty, Jiahao Qiu, Hui Yuan, Alec Koppel, Furong Huang, Dinesh Manocha, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models to human preferences by employing a singular reward model derived from preference data. However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an average improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33% without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the robustness and fairness of our approach. We remark that our findings in this work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement learning in general.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper considers the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use BLInD to find out the limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning. In addition, we present several prompting strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset. Our empirical results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for multiple LLMs.</p>

Using data sourced from Google Vizier, one of the largest proprietary blackbox optimization databases in the world, our extensive experiments demonstrate that language models are capable of very precise numerical regression using only textual representations of mathematical parameters and values, and if given the opportunity to train at scale over multiple tasks, can significantly outperform traditional regression models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Metagenomic data, comprising mixed multi-species genomes, are prevalent in diverse environments like oceans and soils, significantly impacting human health and ecological functions. However, current research relies on K-mer, which limits the capture of structurally and functionally relevant gene contexts. Moreover, these approaches struggle with encoding biologically meaningful genes and fail to address the One-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships inherent in metagenomic data. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FGBERT, a novel metagenomic pre-trained model that employs a protein-based gene representation as a context-aware and structure-relevant tokenizer. FGBERT incorporates Masked Gene Modeling (MGM) to enhance the understanding of inter-gene contextual relationships and Triplet Enhanced Metagenomic Contrastive Learning (TMC) to elucidate gene sequence-function relationships. Pre-trained on over 100 million metagenomic sequences, FGBERT demonstrates superior performance on metagenomic datasets at four levels, spanning gene, functional, bacterial, and environmental levels and ranging from 1k to 213k input sequences. Case studies of ATP Synthase and Gene Operons highlight FGBERT's capability for functional recognition and its biological relevance in metagenomic research.</p>

<p>Abstract: An interactive social robotic assistant must provide services in complex and crowded spaces while adapting its behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Xiang Liu, Shizhe Diao, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Chi Han, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models are an integral part of AI applications, but their high computational cost for training limits accessibility. Initiatives such as Bloom and StarCoder aim to democratize access to pretrained models for collaborative community development. Despite these efforts, such models encounter challenges such as limited multilingual capabilities, risks of catastrophic forgetting during continual pretraining, and the high costs of training models from scratch, alongside the need to align with AI safety standards and regulatory frameworks.
  This paper presents Aurora-M, a 15B parameter multilingual open-source model trained on English, Finnish, Hindi, Japanese, Vietnamese, and code. Continually pretrained from StarCoderPlus on 435B additional tokens, Aurora-M surpasses 2T tokens in total training token count. It is the first open-source multilingual model fine-tuned on human-reviewed safety instructions, thus aligning its development not only with conventional red-teaming considerations, but also with the specific concerns articulated in the Biden-Harris Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.
  We evaluate Aurora-M across a wide range of tasks and languages, showcasing its robustness against catastrophic forgetting and its superior performance in multilingual settings, particularly in safety evaluations. We open-source Aurora-M and its variants to encourage responsible open-source development of large language models at https://huggingface.co/aurora-m.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Amin Mansour, Ozan Unal, Suman Saha, Benjamin Bejar, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing relevance of panoptic segmentation is tied to the advancements in autonomous driving and AR/VR applications. However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunxi Li, Tianyu Zhan, Kairui Fu, Shengyu Zhang, Kun Kuang, Jiwei Li, Zhou Zhao, Fan Wu, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we focus on heterogeneous knowledge transfer across entirely different model architectures, tasks, and modalities. Existing knowledge transfer methods (e.g., backbone sharing, knowledge distillation) often hinge on shared elements within model structures or task-specific features/labels, limiting transfers to complex model types or tasks. To overcome these challenges, we present MergeNet, which learns to bridge the gap of parameter spaces of heterogeneous models, facilitating the direct interaction, extraction, and application of knowledge within these parameter spaces. The core mechanism of MergeNet lies in the parameter adapter, which operates by querying the source model's low-rank parameters and adeptly learning to identify and map parameters into the target model. MergeNet is learned alongside both models, allowing our framework to dynamically transfer and adapt knowledge relevant to the current stage, including the training trajectory knowledge of the source model. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous knowledge transfer demonstrate significant improvements in challenging settings, where representative approaches may falter or prove less applicable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Jia, Yipei Wang, Yan Li, Honggang Chen, Xuehan Bai, Zhaocheng Liu, Jian Liang, Quan Chen, Han Li, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems predominantly rely on ID embedding to capture latent associations among users and items. However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalizations. Leveraging the capability of large language models to comprehend and reason about textual content presents a promising avenue for advancing recommendation systems. To achieve this, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through experiments on the real large-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in industry application. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on six Amazon Review datasets to verify the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuankun Xie, Yi Lu, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Zhiyong Wang, Jianhua Tao, Xin Qi, Xiaopeng Wang, Yukun Liu, Haonan Cheng, Long Ye, Yi Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: With the proliferation of Audio Language Model (ALM) based deepfake audio, there is an urgent need for generalized detection methods. ALM-based deepfake audio currently exhibits widespread, high deception, and type versatility, posing a significant challenge to current audio deepfake detection (ADD) models trained solely on vocoded data. To effectively detect ALM-based deepfake audio, we focus on the mechanism of the ALM-based audio generation method, the conversion from neural codec to waveform. We initially constructed the Codecfake dataset, an open-source, large-scale collection comprising over 1 million audio samples in both English and Chinese, focus on ALM-based audio detection. As countermeasure, to achieve universal detection of deepfake audio and tackle domain ascent bias issue of original sharpness aware minimization (SAM), we propose the CSAM strategy to learn a domain balanced and generalized minima. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that ADD model training with the Codecfake dataset can effectively detects ALM-based audio. Furthermore, our proposed generalization countermeasure yields the lowest average equal error rate (EER) of 0.616% across all test conditions compared to baseline models. The dataset and associated code are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiwang Tang, Weitai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based MLP (PatchMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PatchMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dinghuai Zhang, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, Ruixiang Zhang, Josh Susskind, Navdeep Jaitly, Shuangfei Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the Diffusion Alignment with GFlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqian Zeng, Jianwei Wang, Junyao Yang, Zhengdong Lu, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread usage of online Large Language Models (LLMs) inference services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure of private information in user inputs to malicious eavesdroppers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Wang, Xiangkui Cao, Jie Zhang, Zheng Yuan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen, Wen Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) marks significant strides towards achieving general artificial intelligence. However, these advancements are accompanied by concerns about biased outputs, a challenge that has yet to be thoroughly explored. Existing benchmarks are not sufficiently comprehensive in evaluating biases due to their limited data scale, single questioning format and narrow sources of bias. To address this problem, we introduce VLBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases in LVLMs. VLBiasBench, features a dataset that covers nine distinct categories of social biases, including age, disability status, gender, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, profession, social economic status, as well as two intersectional bias categories: race x gender and race x social economic status. To build a large-scale dataset, we use Stable Diffusion XL model to generate 46,848 high-quality images, which are combined with various questions to creat 128,342 samples. These questions are divided into open-ended and close-ended types, ensuring thorough consideration of bias sources and a comprehensive evaluation of LVLM biases from multiple perspectives. We conduct extensive evaluations on 15 open-source models as well as two advanced closed-source models, yielding new insights into the biases present in these models.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15473">Intertwining CP and NLP: The Generation of Unreasonably Constrained Sentences</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Bonlarron, Jean-Charles R\'egin</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained text generation remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with hard constraints. Traditional NLP approaches prioritize generating meaningful and coherent output. Also, the current state-of-the-art methods often lack the expressiveness and constraint satisfaction capabilities to handle such tasks effectively. Recently, an approach for generating constrained sentences in CP has been proposed in (Bonlarron et al, 2023). This ad-hoc model to solve the sentences generation problem under MNREAD rules proved neithertheless to be computationaly and structuraly unsuitable to deal with other more constrained problems. In this paper, a novel more generic approach is introduced to tackle many of these previously untractable problems, and illustrated here with the quite untractable sentences generation problem following RADNER rules.
  More precisely, this paper presents the CPTextGen Framework. This framework considers a constrained text generation problem as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem. It is solved by a constraint programming method that combines linguistic properties (e.g., n-grams or language level) with other more classical constraints (e.g., the number of characters, syllables). Eventually, a curation phase allows for selecting the best-generated sentences according to perplexity using an LLM.
  The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by tackling a new, more tediously constrained text generation problem: the iconic RADNER sentences problem. This problem aims to generate sentences respecting a set of quite strict rules defined by their use in vision and clinical research. Thanks to our CP-based approach, many new strongly constrained sentences have been successfully generated. This highlights our approach's potential to handle unreasonably constrained text generation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Ciotola, Giuseppe Guarino, Gemine Vivone, Giovanni Poggi, Jocelyn Chanussot, Antonio Plaza, Giuseppe Scarpa</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening consists of fusing a high-resolution panchromatic band and a low-resolution hyperspectral image to obtain a new image with high resolution in both the spatial and spectral domains. These remote sensing products are valuable for a wide range of applications, driving ever growing research efforts. Nonetheless, results still do not meet application demands. In part, this comes from the technical complexity of the task: compared to multispectral pansharpening, many more bands are involved, in a spectral range only partially covered by the panchromatic component and with overwhelming noise. However, another major limiting factor is the absence of a comprehensive framework for the rapid development and accurate evaluation of new methods. This paper attempts to address this issue.
  We started by designing a dataset large and diverse enough to allow reliable training (for data-driven methods) and testing of new methods. Then, we selected a set of state-of-the-art methods, following different approaches, characterized by promising performance, and reimplemented them in a single PyTorch framework. Finally, we carried out a critical comparative analysis of all methods, using the most accredited quality indicators. The analysis highlights the main limitations of current solutions in terms of spectral/spatial quality and computational efficiency, and suggests promising research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sundesh Donthi, Maximilian Spencer, Om Patel, Joon Doh, Eid Rodan</p>
<p>Abstract: For large language models (LLMs) like NLLB and GPT, translating idioms remains a challenge. Our goal is to enhance translation fidelity by improving LLM processing of idiomatic language while preserving the original linguistic style. This has a significant social impact, as it preserves cultural nuances and ensures translated texts retain their intent and emotional resonance, fostering better cross-cultural communication. Previous work has utilized knowledge bases like IdiomKB by providing the LLM with the meaning of an idiom to use in translation. Although this method yielded better results than a direct translation, it is still limited in its ability to preserve idiomatic writing style across languages. In this research, we expand upon the knowledge base to find corresponding idioms in the target language. Our research performs translations using two methods: The first method employs the SentenceTransformers model to semantically generate cosine similarity scores between the meanings of the original and target language idioms, selecting the best idiom (Cosine Similarity method). The second method uses an LLM to find a corresponding idiom in the target language for use in the translation (LLM-generated idiom method). As a baseline, we performed a direct translation without providing additional information. Human evaluations on the English -> Chinese, and Chinese -> English show the Cosine Similarity Lookup method out-performed others in all GPT4o translations. To further build upon IdiomKB, we developed a low-resource Urdu dataset containing Urdu idioms and their translations. Despite dataset limitations, the Cosine Similarity Lookup method shows promise, potentially overcoming language barriers and enabling the exploration of diverse literary works in Chinese and Urdu.(LoResLM @ COLING Preprint)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Si, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of large foundation models within the pre-training and fine-tuning framework has underscored that larger models often yield better results. However, the scaling up of large foundation models has led to soaring costs in fine-tuning and parameter storage, rendering extensive adaptations impractical. This challenge has sparked the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on optimizing a select subset of parameters while keeping the rest fixed, significantly lowering computational and storage overheads. While recent years have witnessed a significant success in PEFT, a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind these methods remains unexplored. To this end, here we take the first step to unify all approaches by dissecting them from a decomposition perspective. We initiate a comprehensive mathematical analysis of these methods, allowing us to delve deeply into their underlying mechanisms, and we explore the reasons behind the variations in performance among different techniques. Furthermore, inspired by our theoretical analysis, we introduce two novel PEFT methods alongside a simple yet effective framework designed to enhance the performance of PEFT techniques across various applications. Our empirical validations, conducted across multiple datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of these methods, showcasing both theoretical validity and practical performance improvements under the guidance of our analytical findings. We believe our work will deepen researchers' understanding of PEFT and other techniques, prompting further contemplation and advancing the research across the whole community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning an effective policy to control high-dimensional, overactuated systems is a significant challenge for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Such control scenarios are often observed in the neural control of vertebrate musculoskeletal systems. The study of these control mechanisms will provide insights into the control of high-dimensional, overactuated systems. The coordination of actuators, known as muscle synergies in neuromechanics, is considered a presumptive mechanism that simplifies the generation of motor commands. The dynamical structure of a system is the basis of its function, allowing us to derive a synergistic representation of actuators. Motivated by this theory, we propose the Dynamical Synergistic Representation (DynSyn) algorithm. DynSyn aims to generate synergistic representations from dynamical structures and perform task-specific, state-dependent adaptation to the representations to improve motor control. We demonstrate DynSyn's efficiency across various tasks involving different musculoskeletal models, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency and robustness compared to baseline algorithms. DynSyn generates interpretable synergistic representations that capture the essential features of dynamical structures and demonstrates generalizability across diverse motor tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haishuo Fang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents' behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a "buy-now" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyeong Kwon, Taegyeong Lee, Taehwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing and generation methods have diverse real-world applications. However, text-guided infinite image synthesis faces several challenges. First, there is a lack of text-image paired datasets with high-resolution and contextual diversity. Second, expanding images based on text requires global coherence and rich local context understanding. Previous studies have mainly focused on limited categories, such as natural landscapes, and also required to train on high-resolution images with paired text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for both global coherence and local context understanding, without any high-resolution text-image paired training dataset. We train the diffusion model to expand an image conditioned on global and local captions generated from the LLM and visual feature. At the inference stage, given an image and a global caption, we use the LLM to generate a next local caption to expand the input image. Then, we expand the image using the global caption, generated local caption and the visual feature to consider global consistency and spatial local context. In experiments, our model outperforms the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the capability of text-guided arbitrary-sized image generation in zero-shot manner with LLM guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mahshad Lotfinia, Keno Bressem, Robert Siepmann, Lisa Adams, Dyke Ferber, Christiane Kuhl, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Sven Nebelung, Daniel Truhn</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. For radiology, RadioRAG establishes a robust framework that substantially improves diagnostic accuracy and factuality in radiological question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Wang, Lizhi Chen, Zhong Qian, Peifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: News media, especially video news media, have penetrated into every aspect of daily life, which also brings the risk of fake news. Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing datasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of superfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process. To address this issue, we construct a dataset named Official-NV, comprising officially published news videos. The crawl officially published videos are augmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification, thereby expanding the dataset. We also propose a new baseline model called OFNVD, which captures key information from multimodal features through a GLU attention mechanism and performs feature enhancement and modal aggregation via a cross-modal Transformer. Benchmarking the dataset and baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in multimodal news detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shican Wu, Xiao Ma, Dehui Luo, Lulu Li, Xiangcheng Shi, Xin Chang, Xiaoyun Lin, Ran Luo, Chunlei Pei, Zhi-Jian Zhao, Jinlong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of the surging torrent of information in the vast ocean of literature exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. To address this issue, we present an automated review generation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs), aimed at overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in literature processing and reducing cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields due to minimal domain knowledge requirements. In a case study on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics. Extended analysis of 1041 articles provided deep insights into catalysts' composition, structure, and performance. Recognizing LLMs' hallucinations, we implemented a multi-layered quality control strategy, effectively mitigating risks and ensuring reliability, as quantitatively demonstrated through manual verification. Expert verification confirms the accuracy and citation integrity of generated reviews, demonstrating LLM hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with over 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, aiding researchers in tracking advancements and recommending literature. This approach showcases LLMs' role in enhancing scientific research productivity and sets the stage for further exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Ren, Steven Basart, Adam Khoja, Alice Gatti, Long Phan, Xuwang Yin, Mantas Mazeika, Alexander Pan, Gabriel Mukobi, Ryan H. Kim, Stephen Fitz, Dan Hendrycks</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with both upstream model capabilities and training compute, potentially enabling "safetywashing"--where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Liu, Roger Proksch, Jason Bemis, Utkarsh Pratiush, Astita Dubey, Mahshid Ahmadi, Reece Emery, Philip D. Rack, Yu-Chen Liu, Jan-Chi Yang, Sergei V. Kalinin</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bi'an Du, Lingbei Meng, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is a major challenge in computer vision, aiming to create complete three-dimensional models from limited viewing angles. Key obstacles include: 1) a small number of input images with inconsistent information; 2) dependence on input image quality; and 3) large model parameter sizes. To tackle these issues, we propose a self-augmented two-stage Gaussian splatting framework enhanced with structural masks for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Initially, our method generates a basic 3D Gaussian representation from sparse inputs and renders multi-view images. We then fine-tune a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to enhance these images, using them as augmented data to further optimize the 3D Gaussians.Additionally, a structural masking strategy during training enhances the model's robustness to sparse inputs and noise. Experiments on benchmarks like MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, and OpenIllumination demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and multi-view consistency with sparse inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, JinYi Yoon, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Bo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate an excessive number of visual tokens due to the need to encode multiple partitions of a high-resolution image input. Processing such a large number of visual tokens through multiple transformer networks poses significant computational challenges, particularly for resource-constrained commodity GPUs. To address this challenge, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a plug-and-play token-dropping method designed to operate within a fixed token budget. HiRED leverages the attention of CLS token in the vision transformer (ViT) to assess the visual content of the image partitions and allocate an optimal token budget for each partition accordingly. The most informative visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget are then selected and passed to the subsequent Large Language Model (LLM). We showed that HiRED achieves superior accuracy and performance, compared to existing token-dropping methods. Empirically, HiRED-20% (i.e., a 20% token budget) on LLaVA-Next-7B achieves a 4.7x increase in token generation throughput, reduces response latency by 78%, and saves 14% of GPU memory for single inference on an NVIDIA TESLA P40 (24 GB). For larger batch sizes (e.g., 4), HiRED-20% prevents out-of-memory errors by cutting memory usage by 30%, while preserving throughput and latency benefits.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congchi Yin, Feng Li, Shu Zhang, Zike Wang, Jun Shao, Piji Li, Jianhua Chen, Xun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The clinical diagnosis of most mental disorders primarily relies on the conversations between psychiatrist and patient. The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymized patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and generates conversations under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k. This dataset is built upon 1000 real, anonymized patient cases by cooperating with Shanghai Mental Health Center and comprises 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results and treatment opinions as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labeled dataset for Chinese mental disorders diagnosis. Human evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic process of mental disorders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaihui Cheng, Ce Liu, Qingkun Su, Jun Wang, Liwei Zhang, Yining Tang, Yao Yao, Siyu Zhu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein structure prediction is pivotal for understanding the structure-function relationship of proteins, advancing biological research, and facilitating pharmaceutical development and experimental design. While deep learning methods and the expanded availability of experimental 3D protein structures have accelerated structure prediction, the dynamic nature of protein structures has received limited attention. This study introduces an innovative 4D diffusion model incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data to learn dynamic protein structures. Our approach is distinguished by the following components: (1) a unified diffusion model capable of generating dynamic protein structures, including both the backbone and side chains, utilizing atomic grouping and side-chain dihedral angle predictions; (2) a reference network that enhances structural consistency by integrating the latent embeddings of the initial 3D protein structures; and (3) a motion alignment module aimed at improving temporal structural coherence across multiple time steps. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based model aimed at predicting protein trajectories across multiple time steps simultaneously. Validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our model exhibits high accuracy in predicting dynamic 3D structures of proteins containing up to 256 amino acids over 32 time steps, effectively capturing both local flexibility in stable states and significant conformational changes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiong Wang, Daniele Paliotta, Avner May, Alexander M. Rush, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to the substantial computational overhead and memory requirements. Activation sparsification can mitigate these resource challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, they do not model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, resulting in suboptimal performance degradation. To address the limitations, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem to explicitly capture the relationship between activation sparsity and model performance. Then, this paper proposes CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective sparsification involves applying thresholding-based activation sparsification to specific layers within the attention modules. Finally, we detail the implementation of sparse kernels to accelerate LLM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHESS achieves lower performance degradation over eight downstream tasks while activating fewer parameters than existing methods, thus speeding up the LLM inference by up to 1.27x.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cyber timeline analysis, or forensic timeline analysis, is crucial in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). It examines artefacts and events particularly timestamps and metadata to detect anomalies, establish correlations, and reconstruct incident timelines. Traditional methods rely on structured artefacts, such as logs and filesystem metadata, using specialised tools for evidence identification and feature extraction. This paper introduces GenDFIR, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama 3.1 8B in zero shot mode, integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. Incident data is preprocessed into a structured knowledge base, enabling the RAG agent to retrieve relevant events based on user prompts. The LLM interprets this context, offering semantic enrichment. Tested on synthetic data in a controlled environment, results demonstrate GenDFIR's reliability and robustness, showcasing LLMs potential to automate timeline analysis and advance threat detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Maheshwari, Manxi Wu, Shankar Sastry</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</p>

<p>Abstract: The complexities of table structures and question logic make table-based question answering (TQA) tasks challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring task simplification before solving. This paper reveals that the reasoning process during task simplification may be more valuable than the simplified tasks themselves and aims to improve TQA performance by leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities. We propose a Seek-and-Solve pipeline that instructs the LLM to first seek relevant information and then answer questions, integrating these two stages at the reasoning level into a coherent Seek-and-Solve Chain of Thought (SS-CoT). Additionally, we distill a single-step TQA-solving prompt from this pipeline, using demonstrations with SS-CoT paths to guide the LLM in solving complex TQA tasks under In-Context Learning settings. Our experiments show that our approaches result in improved performance and reliability while being efficient. Our findings emphasize the importance of eliciting LLMs' reasoning capabilities to handle complex TQA tasks effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning user preferences from implicit feedback is one of the core challenges in recommendation. The difficulty lies in the potential noise within implicit feedback. Therefore, various denoising recommendation methods have been proposed recently. However, most of them overly rely on the hyperparameter configurations, inevitably leading to inadequacies in model adaptability and generalization performance. In this study, we propose a novel Adaptive Ensemble Learning (AEL) for denoising recommendation, which employs a sparse gating network as a brain, selecting suitable experts to synthesize appropriate denoising capacities for different data samples. To address the ensemble learning shortcoming of model complexity and ensure sub-recommender diversity, we also proposed a novel method that stacks components to create sub-recommenders instead of directly constructing them. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that AEL outperforms others in kinds of popular metrics, even in the presence of substantial and dynamic noise.

<p>Abstract: Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life. While deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these disorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although differential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its application in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite the equally critical privacy concerns. This study is the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with high privacy levels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we demonstrated the vulnerability of non-private models to explicit gradient inversion attacks, reconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's effectiveness in mitigating these risks. To generalize our findings across languages and disorders, we validated our approach on a dataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained models from healthy English-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful pretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable accuracy under DP constraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed minimal gender bias at reasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for addressing age-related disparities. Our results establish that DP can balance privacy and utility in speech disorder detection, while highlighting unique challenges in privacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a foundation for refining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse patient groups in real-world deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitian Gao, Boye Niu, Xuzheng He, Haotian Xu, Hongzhang Liu, Aiwei Liu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose SC-MCTS*: a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and speed. Our motivation comes from: 1. Previous MCTS LLM reasoning works often overlooked its biggest drawback--slower speed compared to CoT; 2. Previous research mainly used MCTS as a tool for LLM reasoning on various tasks with limited quantitative analysis or ablation studies of its components from reasoning interpretability perspective. 3. The reward model is the most crucial component in MCTS, however previous work has rarely conducted in-depth study or improvement of MCTS's reward models. Thus, we conducted extensive ablation studies and quantitative analysis on components of MCTS, revealing the impact of each component on the MCTS reasoning performance of LLMs. Building on this, (i) we designed a highly interpretable reward model based on the principle of contrastive decoding and (ii) achieved an average speed improvement of 51.9% per node using speculative decoding. Additionally, (iii) we improved UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation used in previous works, resulting in significant performance improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si-An Chen, Lesly Miculicich, Julian Martin Eisenschlos, Zifeng Wang, Zilong Wang, Yanfei Chen, Yasuhisa Fujii, Hsuan-Tien Lin, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables. However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints. In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miroslav Cibula, Matthias Kerzel, Igor Farka\v{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal learning allows humans to predict the effect of their actions on the known environment and use this knowledge to plan the execution of more complex actions. Such knowledge also captures the behaviour of the environment and can be used for its analysis and the reasoning behind the behaviour. This type of knowledge is also crucial in the design of intelligent robotic systems with common sense. In this paper, we study causal relations by learning the forward and inverse models based on data generated by a simulated robotic arm involved in two sensorimotor tasks. As a next step, we investigate feature attribution methods for the analysis of the forward model, which reveals the low-level causal effects corresponding to individual features of the state vector related to both the arm joints and the environment features. This type of analysis provides solid ground for dimensionality reduction of the state representations, as well as for the aggregation of knowledge towards the explainability of causal effects at higher levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifan Liu, Amin Karbasi, Theodoros Rekatsinas</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning foundation models for specific tasks is an emerging paradigm in modern machine learning. The efficacy of task-specific finetuning largely depends on the selection of appropriate training data. We present TSDS (Task-Specific Data Selection), a framework to select data for task-specific model finetuning, guided by a small but representative set of examples from the target task. To do so, we formulate data selection for task-specific finetuning as an optimization problem with a distribution alignment loss based on optimal transport to capture the discrepancy between the selected data and the target distribution. In addition, we add a regularizer to encourage the diversity of the selected data and incorporate kernel density estimation into the regularizer to reduce the negative effects of near-duplicates among the candidate data. We connect our optimization problem to nearest neighbor search and design efficient algorithms to compute the optimal solution based on approximate nearest neighbor search techniques. We evaluate our method on data selection for both continued pretraining and instruction tuning of language models. We show that instruction tuning using data selected by our method with a 1% selection ratio often outperforms using the full dataset and beats the baseline selection methods by 1.5 points in F1 score on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeru Shi, Kai Mei, Yongye Su, Chaoji Zuo, Wenyue Hua, Wujiang Xu, Yujie Ren, Zirui Liu, Mengnan Du, Dong Deng, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anbang Wang, Difei Mei, Zhichao Zhang, Xiuxiu Bai, Ran Yao, Zewen Fang, Min Hu, Zhirui Cao, Haitao Sun, Yifeng Guo, Hongyao Zhou, Yu Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ReverseNER, a method aimed at overcoming the limitation of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) tasks, arising from their reliance on pre-provided demonstrations. ReverseNER tackles this challenge by constructing a reliable example library composed of dozens of entity-labeled sentences, generated through the reverse process of NER. Specifically, while conventional NER methods label entities in a sentence, ReverseNER features reversing the process by using an LLM to generate entities from their definitions and subsequently expand them into full sentences. During the entity expansion process, the LLM is guided to generate sentences by replicating the structures of a set of specific \textsl{feature sentences}, extracted from the task sentences by clustering. This expansion process produces dozens of entity-labeled task-relevant sentences. After constructing the example library, the method selects several semantically similar entity-labeled examples for each task sentence as references to facilitate the LLM's entity recognition. We also propose an entity-level self-consistency scoring mechanism to improve NER performance with LLMs. Experiments show that ReverseNER significantly outperforms other zero-shot NER methods with LLMs, marking a notable improvement in NER for domains without labeled data, while declining computational resource consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyuan Shi, Yong Wang, Hangyu Li, Xiangxiang Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making alignment methods for these models increasingly important. A key challenge is the sparsity of preference labels, which are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories. This raises the issue of how to assign credit across denoising steps based on these sparse labels. In this paper, we propose Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE), a novel method for credit assignment. Unlike previous approaches that rely on auxiliary models or hand-crafted schemes, DDE derives its strategy more explicitly. The proposed DDE directly estimates the terminal denoised distribution from the perspective of each step. It is equipped with two estimation strategies and capable of representing the entire denoising trajectory with a single model inference. Theoretically and empirically, we show that DDE prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory, resulting in a novel and effective credit assignment scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. However, the invisible reasoning process leaves us a doubt that, can implicit CoT really be equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is either trained or prompted to perform implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that when prompted, LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. But when trained, they indeed calculate intermediate steps. Moreover, in both situations, we find the effect of using implicit CoT is susceptible to the format of the problem, reaffirming the current deficiency of implicit CoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Liu, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the emerging trend of extensions in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that significantly enhance developer productivity. Especially, popular AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine provide conveniences like automated code completion and debugging. While these extensions offer numerous benefits, they may introduce privacy and security concerns to software developers. However, there is no existing work that systematically analyzes the security and privacy concerns, including the risks of data exposure in VSCode extensions.
  In this paper, we investigate on the security issues of cross-extension interactions in VSCode and shed light on the vulnerabilities caused by data exposure among different extensions. Our study uncovers high-impact security flaws that could allow adversaries to stealthily acquire or manipulate credential-related data (e.g., passwords, API keys, access tokens) from other extensions if not properly handled by extension vendors. To measure their prevalence, we design a novel automated risk detection framework that leverages program analysis and natural language processing techniques to automatically identify potential risks in VSCode extensions. By applying our tool to 27,261 real-world VSCode extensions, we discover that 8.5% of them (i.e., 2,325 extensions) are exposed to credential-related data leakage through various vectors, such as commands, user input, and configurations. Our study sheds light on the security challenges and flaws of the extension-in-IDE paradigm and provides suggestions and recommendations for improving the security of VSCode extensions and mitigating the risks of data exposure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Zhi Li, Mingyue Cheng, Zheng Zhang, Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Table-based reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in its integration with Large Language Model (LLM) which has revolutionized the general reasoning paradigm. Numerous LLM-based studies introduce symbolic tools (e.g., databases, Python) as assistants to extend human-like abilities in structured table understanding and complex arithmetic computations. However, these studies can be improved better in simulating human cognitive behavior when using symbolic tools, as they still suffer from limitations of non-standard logical splits and constrained operation pools. In this study, we propose PoTable as a novel table-based reasoning method that simulates a human tabular analyst, which integrates a Python interpreter as the real-time executor accompanied by an LLM-based operation planner and code generator. Specifically, PoTable follows a human-like logical stage split and extends the operation pool into an open-world space without any constraints. Through planning and executing in each distinct stage, PoTable standardly completes the entire reasoning process and produces superior reasoning results along with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. Accordingly, the effectiveness and explainability of PoTable are fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments over three evaluation datasets from two public benchmarks on two backbones show the outstanding performance of our approach. In particular, GPT-based PoTable achieves over 4% higher absolute accuracy than runner-ups on all evaluation datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Maia Polo, Seamus Somerstep, Leshem Choshen, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks such as coding and emotional intelligence applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models for Verilog code generation. However, the current quality of the generated Verilog code remains suboptimal. This is largely due to the absence of well-defined, well-organized datasets with high-quality samples, as well as a lack of innovative fine-tuning methods and models specifically trained on Verilog. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source dataset and a corresponding fine-tuning technique, which utilizes a multi-layered structure that we refer to as PyraNet. Our experiments demonstrate that employing the proposed dataset and fine-tuning approach leads to a more accurate fine-tuned model, producing syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code. The evaluation results show improvements by up-to $32.6\%$ in comparison to the CodeLlama-7B baseline model and up-to $16.7\%$ in comparison to the state-of-the-art models using VerilogEval evaluation platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence models have demonstrated remarkable success in behavioral planning by leveraging previously collected demonstrations. However, solving multi-task missions remains a significant challenge, particularly when the planner must adapt to unseen constraints and tasks, such as discovering goals and unlocking doors. Such behavioral planning problems are challenging to solve due to: a) agents failing to adapt beyond the single task learned through their reward function, and b) inability to generalize to new environments, e.g., those with walls and locked doors, when trained only in planar environments. Consequently, state-of-the-art decision-making methods are limited to missions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training demonstrations and can be solved within a short (temporal) planning horizon. To address this, we propose GenPlan: a stochastic and adaptive planner that leverages discrete-flow models for generative sequence modeling, enabling sample-efficient exploration and exploitation. This framework relies on an iterative denoising procedure to generate a sequence of goals and actions. This approach captures multi-modal action distributions and facilitates goal and task discovery, thereby generalizing to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions not part of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through multiple simulation environments. Notably, GenPlan outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% on adaptive planning tasks, where the agent adapts to multi-task missions while leveraging demonstrations from single-goal-reaching tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Sheng, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Jiantao Zhou, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forgery localization (IFL) is a crucial technique for preventing tampered image misuse and protecting social safety. However, due to the rapid development of image tampering technologies, extracting more comprehensive and accurate forgery clues remains an urgent challenge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel information-theoretic IFL framework named SUMI-IFL that imposes sufficiency-view and minimality-view constraints on forgery feature representation. First, grounded in the theoretical analysis of mutual information, the sufficiency-view constraint is enforced on the feature extraction network to ensure that the latent forgery feature contains comprehensive forgery clues. Considering that forgery clues obtained from a single aspect alone may be incomplete, we construct the latent forgery feature by integrating several individual forgery features from multiple perspectives. Second, based on the information bottleneck, the minimality-view constraint is imposed on the feature reasoning network to achieve an accurate and concise forgery feature representation that counters the interference of task-unrelated features. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of SUMI-IFL to existing state-of-the-art methods, not only on in-dataset comparisons but also on cross-dataset comparisons.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

<p>Abstract: Although large vision-language-action (VLA) models pretrained on extensive robot datasets offer promising generalist policies for robotic learning, they still struggle with spatial-temporal dynamics in interactive robotics, making them less effective in handling complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) leverages heterogeneous modalities, such as language, vision, and audio, to enhance the understanding of human sentiment. While existing models often focus on extracting shared information across modalities or directly fusing heterogeneous modalities, such approaches can introduce redundancy and conflicts due to equal treatment of all modalities and the mutual transfer of information between modality pairs. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled-Language-Focused (DLF) multimodal representation learning framework, which incorporates a feature disentanglement module to separate modality-shared and modality-specific information. To further reduce redundancy and enhance language-targeted features, four geometric measures are introduced to refine the disentanglement process. A Language-Focused Attractor (LFA) is further developed to strengthen language representation by leveraging complementary modality-specific information through a language-guided cross-attention mechanism. The framework also employs hierarchical predictions to improve overall accuracy. Extensive experiments on two popular MSA datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed DLF framework. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the feature disentanglement module, language-focused attractor, and hierarchical predictions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxiang Gao, Weisheng Xie, Yiwei Xiang, Feng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Striking an optimal balance between minimal drafting latency and high speculation accuracy to enhance the inference speed of Large Language Models remains a significant challenge in speculative decoding. In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Shaki, Yonatan Aumann, Sarit Kraus</p>
<p>Abstract: Issue salience is a major determinant in voters' decisions. Candidates and political parties campaign to shift salience to their advantage - a process termed priming. We study the dynamics, strategies and equilibria of campaign spending for voter priming in multi-issue multi-party settings. We consider both parliamentary elections, where parties aim to maximize their share of votes, and various settings for presidential elections, where the winner takes all. For parliamentary elections, we show that pure equilibrium spending always exists and can be computed in time linear in the number of voters. For two parties and all settings, a spending equilibrium exists such that each party invests only in a single issue, and an equilibrium can be computed in time that is polynomial in the number of issues and linear in the number of voters. We also show that in most presidential settings no equilibrium exists. Additional properties of optimal campaign strategies are also studied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghao Xia, Meiyan Xie, Yong Xu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: For modern recommender systems, the use of low-dimensional latent representations to embed users and items based on their observed interactions has become commonplace. However, many existing recommendation models are primarily designed for coarse-grained and homogeneous interactions, which limits their effectiveness in two critical dimensions. Firstly, these models fail to leverage the relational dependencies that exist across different types of user behaviors, such as page views, collects, comments, and purchases. Secondly, they struggle to capture the fine-grained latent factors that drive user interaction patterns. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous graph collaborative filtering model MixRec that excels at disentangling users' multi-behavior interaction patterns and uncovering the latent intent factors behind each behavior. Our model achieves this by incorporating intent disentanglement and multi-behavior modeling, facilitated by a parameterized heterogeneous hypergraph architecture. Furthermore, we introduce a novel contrastive learning paradigm that adaptively explores the advantages of self-supervised data augmentation, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against data sparsity and expressiveness with relation heterogeneity. To validate the efficacy of MixRec, we conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets. The results clearly demonstrate its superior performance, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art baselines. Our model is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/MixRec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Chen, Wenbo Hu, Guande He, Zhijie Deng, Zheng Zhang, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications. Code and IDK dataset: https://github.com/hfutml/Calibration-MLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghao He, Hu Su, Haiyong Yu, Cong Yang, Wei Sui, Cong Wang, Song Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-set object detection (OSOD) is highly desirable for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments. However, existing OSOD methods often fail to meet the requirements of robotic applications due to their high computational burden and complex deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes a light-weight framework called Decoupled OSOD (DOSOD), which is a practical and highly efficient solution to support real-time OSOD tasks in robotic systems. Specifically, DOSOD builds upon the YOLO-World pipeline by integrating a vision-language model (VLM) with a detector. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) adaptor is developed to transform text embeddings extracted by the VLM into a joint space, within which the detector learns the region representations of class-agnostic proposals. Cross-modality features are directly aligned in the joint space, avoiding the complex feature interactions and thereby improving computational efficiency. DOSOD operates like a traditional closed-set detector during the testing phase, effectively bridging the gap between closed-set and open-set detection. Compared to the baseline YOLO-World, the proposed DOSOD significantly enhances real-time performance while maintaining comparable accuracy. The slight DOSOD-S model achieves a Fixed AP of $26.7\%$, compared to $26.2\%$ for YOLO-World-v1-S and $22.7\%$ for YOLO-World-v2-S, using similar backbones on the LVIS minival dataset. Meanwhile, the FPS of DOSOD-S is $57.1\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v1-S and $29.6\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v2-S. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the DOSOD model facilitates the deployment of edge devices. The codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/D-Robotics-AI-Lab/DOSOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Shi, Xiaochuang Han, Chunting Zhou, Weixin Liang, Xi Victoria Lin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaijie Wang, Shibo Hao, Hanze Dong, Shenao Zhang, Yilin Bao, Ziran Yang, Yi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with offline reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for quickly adapting them to complex tasks. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation. We show in principle that it reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and embodied agent control (ALFWorld). The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available. Furthermore, the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the tree search for free, which can further boost performance during test time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenchang Duan, Zhenguo Gao, Jiwan He, Jinguo Xian</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of intelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are still prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Meanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to effectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the rationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped with the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets. Specifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{9.60\%}\)} and average waiting time by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{15.28\%}\)}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of \textit{pedagogical instruction following}, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is preferred substantially by expert raters across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of 31\% over GPT-4o, 11\% over Claude 3.5, and 13\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2) context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3) validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and refines the system performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth usage of face recognition in people's daily life, face anti-spoofing becomes increasingly important to avoid malicious attacks. Recent face anti-spoofing models can reach a high classification accuracy on multiple datasets but these models can only tell people "this face is fake" while lacking the explanation to answer "why it is fake". Such a system undermines trustworthiness and causes user confusion, as it denies their requests without providing any explanations. In this paper, we incorporate XAI into face anti-spoofing and propose a new problem termed X-FAS (eXplainable Face Anti-Spoofing) empowering face anti-spoofing models to provide an explanation. We propose SPED (SPoofing Evidence Discovery), an X-FAS method which can discover spoof concepts and provide reliable explanations on the basis of discovered concepts. To evaluate the quality of X-FAS methods, we propose an X-FAS benchmark with annotated spoofing evidence by experts. We analyze SPED explanations on face anti-spoofing dataset and compare SPED quantitatively and qualitatively with previous XAI methods on proposed X-FAS benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate SPED's ability to generate reliable explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel concepts by leveraging prior knowledge learned from a few samples. However, for visually intensive tasks such as few-shot semantic segmentation, pixel-level annotations are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the more challenging image-level annotations and propose an adaptive frequency-aware network (AFANet) for weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS). Specifically, we first propose a cross-granularity frequency-aware module (CFM) that decouples RGB images into high-frequency and low-frequency distributions and further optimizes semantic structural information by realigning them. Unlike most existing WFSS methods using the textual information from the multi-modal language-vision model, e.g., CLIP, in an offline learning manner, we further propose a CLIP-guided spatial-adapter module (CSM), which performs spatial domain adaptive transformation on textual information through online learning, thus providing enriched cross-modal semantic information for CFM. Extensive experiments on the Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and COCO-20\textsuperscript{i} datasets demonstrate that AFANet has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Yang, Chong Wang, Meihua Zhao, Zimeng Zhao, Huiling Zheng, Bin Zhang, Jianing Wang, Xiaofeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ocean forecasting is crucial for both scientific research and societal benefits. Currently, the most accurate forecasting systems are global ocean forecasting systems (GOFSs), which represent the ocean state variables (OSVs) as discrete grids and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the transitions of oceanic state variables using numerical methods. However, GOFSs processes are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors. Recently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted forecasting speed and accuracy. Unfortunately, building a large AI ocean forecasting system that can be considered cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled forecasts remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce LangYa, a cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled ocean forecasting system. Results demonstrate that the time embedding module in LangYa enables a single model to make forecasts with lead times ranging from 1 to 7 days. The air-sea coupled module effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention module improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training, and the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline forecasting. Compared to existing numerical and AI-based ocean forecasting systems, LangYa uses 27 years of global ocean data from the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation version 12 (GLORYS12) for training and achieves more reliable deterministic forecasting results for OSVs. LangYa forecasting system provides global ocean researchers with access to a powerful software tool for accurate ocean forecasting and opens a new paradigm for ocean science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Hu, Richard L. Lewis</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive tasks originally developed for humans are now increasingly used to study language models. While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance instead reflects a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. In addition, we challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the ongoing conversation around refining methodologies for the cognitive evaluation of language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have achieved significant advancements. Correspondingly, many automated metrics have emerged to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of generative models. However, the performance comparison among these automated metrics is limited by existing small datasets. Additionally, these datasets lack the capacity to assess the performance of automated metrics at a fine-grained level. In this study, we contribute an EvalMuse-40K benchmark, gathering 40K image-text pairs with fine-grained human annotations for image-text alignment-related tasks. In the construction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt sampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our benchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of image-text alignment metrics for T2I models. Meanwhile, we introduce two new methods to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of T2I models: FGA-BLIP2 which involves end-to-end fine-tuning of a vision-language model to produce fine-grained image-text alignment scores and PN-VQA which adopts a novel positive-negative VQA manner in VQA models for zero-shot fine-grained evaluation. Both methods achieve impressive performance in image-text alignment evaluations. We also use our methods to rank current AIGC models, in which the results can serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of T2I generation. The data and code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongxin Cheng, Yifan Peng, Yuxin Lai, Xingda Wei, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The stateful nature of large language model (LLM) servingcan easily throttle precious GPU memory under load burstor long-generation requests like chain-of-thought reasoning,causing latency spikes due to queuing incoming requests. However, state-of-the-art KVCache centric approaches handleload spikes by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache,which faces an essential tradeoff between the performance ofongoing vs. incoming requests and thus still severely violatesSLO.This paper makes a key observation such that model param-eters are independent of the requests and are replicated acrossGPUs, and thus proposes a parameter-centric approach byselectively dropping replicated parameters to leave preciousmemory for requests. However, LLM requires KVCache tobe saved in bound with model parameters and thus droppingparameters can cause either huge computation waste or longnetwork delay, affecting all ongoing requests. Based on the ob-servation that attention operators can be decoupled from otheroperators, this paper further proposes a novel remote attentionmechanism through pipeline parallelism so as to serve up-coming requests with the additional memory borrowed fromparameters on remote GPUs. This paper further addresses sev-eral other challenges including lively exchanging KVCachewith incomplete parameters, generating an appropriate planthat balances memory requirements with cooperative exe-cution overhead, and seamlessly restoring parameters whenthe throttling has gone. Evaluations show thatKUNSERVEreduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 27.3x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of LLMs has deflected a growing portion of human-computer interactions towards LLM-based chatbots. The remarkable abilities of these models allow users to interact using long, diverse natural language text covering a wide range of topics and styles. Phrasing these messages is a time and effort consuming task, calling for an autocomplete solution to assist users. We introduce the task of chatbot interaction autocomplete. We present ChaI-TeA: CHat InTEraction Autocomplete; An autcomplete evaluation framework for LLM-based chatbot interactions. The framework includes a formal definition of the task, coupled with suitable datasets and metrics. We use the framework to evaluate After formally defining the task along with suitable datasets and metrics, we test 9 models on the defined auto completion task, finding that while current off-the-shelf models perform fairly, there is still much room for improvement, mainly in ranking of the generated suggestions. We provide insights for practitioners working on this task and open new research directions for researchers in the field. We release our framework to serve as a foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoping Wu, Jie Hu, Xiaoming Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saskia Laura Schr\"oer, Giovanni Apruzzese, Soheil Human, Pavel Laskov, Hyrum S. Anderson, Edward W. N. Bernroider, Aurore Fass, Ben Nassi, Vera Rimmer, Fabio Roli, Samer Salam, Ashley Shen, Ali Sunyaev, Tim Wadwha-Brown, Isabel Wagner, Gang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laypeople -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</p>
