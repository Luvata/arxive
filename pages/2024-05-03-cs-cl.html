<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Liu, Ran Liu, Hua Wang, Wray Buntine</p>
<p>Abstract: ChatGPT has changed the AI community and an active research line is the performance evaluation of ChatGPT. A key challenge for the evaluation is that ChatGPT is still closed-source and traditional benchmark datasets may have been used by ChatGPT as the training data. In this paper, (i) we survey recent studies which uncover the real performance levels of ChatGPT in seven categories of NLP tasks, (ii) review the social implications and safety issues of ChatGPT, and (iii) emphasize key challenges and opportunities for its evaluation. We hope our survey can shed some light on its blackbox manner, so that researchers are not misleaded by its surface generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang, Zheyu Shen, Guoheng Sun, Yucong Dai, Yongkai Wu, Hongyi Wang, Ang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted for many downstream tasks and tailored to align with human preferences through fine-tuning. Recent studies have discovered that LLMs can achieve desirable performance with only a small amount of high-quality data, suggesting that a large amount of the data in these extensive datasets is redundant or even harmful. Identifying high-quality data from vast datasets to curate small yet effective datasets has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce SHED, an automated dataset refinement framework based on Shapley value for instruction fine-tuning. SHED eliminates the need for human intervention or the use of commercial LLMs. Moreover, the datasets curated through SHED exhibit transferability, indicating they can be reused across different LLMs with consistently high performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the datasets curated by SHED. The results demonstrate SHED's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across various tasks and LLMs; notably, datasets comprising only 10% of the original data selected by SHED achieve performance comparable to or surpassing that of the full datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David M. Markowitz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance public trust in science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from PNAS, yoked to those generated by AI, this work assessed linguistic simplicity across such summaries and public perceptions. Study 1a analyzed simplicity features of PNAS abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used GPT-4 to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Finally, Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written GPT summaries facilitated more favorable public perceptions of scientists (their credibility, trustworthiness) than more complexly-written human PNAS summaries. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Furui Cheng, Vil\'em Zouhar, Robin Shing Moon Chan, Daniel F\"urst, Hendrik Strobelt, Mennatallah El-Assady</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual examples are useful for exploring the decision boundaries of machine learning models and determining feature attributions. How can we apply counterfactual-based methods to analyze and explain LLMs? We identify the following key challenges. First, the generated textual counterfactuals should be meaningful and readable to users and thus can be mentally compared to draw conclusions. Second, to make the solution scalable to long-form text, users should be equipped with tools to create batches of counterfactuals from perturbations at various granularity levels and interactively analyze the results. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges and contribute 1) a novel algorithm for generating batches of complete and meaningful textual counterfactuals by removing and replacing text segments in different granularities, and 2) LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization tool to help users understand an LLM's behaviors by interactively inspecting and aggregating meaningful counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by the grammatical correctness of its generated counterfactuals using 1,000 samples from medical, legal, finance, education, and news datasets. In our experiments, 97.2% of the counterfactuals are grammatically correct. Through a use case, user studies, and feedback from experts, we demonstrate the usefulness and usability of the proposed interactive visualization tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simranjit Singh, Michael Fore, Dimitrios Stamoulis</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in remote sensing (RS) applications. However, existing benchmarks assume question-answering input templates over predefined image-text data pairs. These standalone instructions neglect the intricacies of realistic user-grounded tasks. Consider a geospatial analyst: they zoom in a map area, they draw a region over which to collect satellite imagery, and they succinctly ask "Detect all objects here". Where is `here`, if it is not explicitly hardcoded in the image-text template, but instead is implied by the system state, e.g., the live map positioning? To bridge this gap, we present GeoLLM-QA, a benchmark designed to capture long sequences of verbal, visual, and click-based actions on a real UI platform. Through in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs over a diverse set of 1,000 tasks, we offer insights towards stronger agents for RS applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davit Melikidze, Alexander Gamkrelidze</p>
<p>Abstract: This research proposes a novel approach to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task in the Georgian language, based on supervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) on a dataset formed by filtering the Georgian Common Crawls corpus. The dataset is used to train a classifier for words with multiple senses. Additionally, we present experimental results of using LSTM for WSD. Accurately disambiguating homonyms is crucial in natural language processing. Georgian, an agglutinative language belonging to the Kartvelian language family, presents unique challenges in this context. The aim of this paper is to highlight the specific problems concerning homonym disambiguation in the Georgian language and to present our approach to solving them. The techniques discussed in the article achieve 95% accuracy for predicting lexical meanings of homonyms using a hand-classified dataset of over 7500 sentences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomin Yu, Yezhaohui Wang, Yanfang Chen, Zhen Tao, Dinghao Xi, Shichao Song, Simin Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence models, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), have revolutionized content production methods. These artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) have become deeply embedded in various aspects of daily life and work, spanning texts, images, videos, and audio. The authenticity of AI-generated content is progressively enhancing, approaching human-level creative standards. However, these technologies have also led to the emergence of Fake Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (FAIGC), posing new challenges in distinguishing genuine information. It is crucial to recognize that AIGC technology is akin to a double-edged sword; its potent generative capabilities, while beneficial, also pose risks for the creation and dissemination of FAIGC. In this survey, We propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of FAIGC methods today. Next, we explore the modalities and generative technologies of FAIGC, categorized under AI-generated disinformation and AI-generated misinformation. From various perspectives, we then introduce FAIGC detection methods, including Deceptive FAIGC Detection, Deepfake Detection, and Hallucination-based FAIGC Detection. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges and promising areas for future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00715">Towards Adapting Open-Source Large Language Models for Expert-Level Clinical Note Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyin Wang, Chufan Gao, Bolun Liu, Qiping Xu, Guleid Hussein, Mohamad El Labban, Kingsley Iheasirim, Hariprasad Korsapati, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in handling clinical text summarization tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that a small open-source LLM can be effectively trained to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. We achieve this through a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model. This process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced an enhanced approach, termed DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini Pro serving as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, is capable of generating clinical notes that are comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. Notably, in the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness compared to physician-authored notes (4.1/5). Additionally, we identified caveats in public clinical note datasets, such as ACI-BENCH. We highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format. Overall, our research demonstrates the potential and feasibility of training smaller, open-source LLMs to assist with clinical documentation, capitalizing on healthcare institutions' access to patient records and domain expertise. We have made our newly created synthetic clinic dialogue-note dataset and the physician feedback dataset publicly available to foster future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Liu, Hongjian Zhou, Yining Hua, Omid Rohanian, Lei Clifton, David A. Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians has attracted remarkable attention. Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended question-answering task with answer options for evaluation. However, in real clinical settings, many clinical decisions, such as treatment recommendations, involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. Meanwhile, existing studies mainly use accuracy to assess model performance. In this paper, we comprehensively benchmark diverse LLMs in healthcare, to clearly understand their strengths and weaknesses. Our benchmark contains seven tasks and thirteen datasets across medical language generation, understanding, and reasoning. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the existing sixteen LLMs in healthcare under both zero-shot and few-shot (i.e., 1,3,5-shot) learning settings. We report the results on five metrics (i.e. matching, faithfulness, comprehensiveness, generalizability, and robustness) that are critical in achieving trust from clinical users. We further invite medical experts to conduct human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinaba Bala, Ashok Urlana, Rahul Mishra, Parameswari Krishnamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining sufficient information in one's mother tongue is crucial for satisfying the information needs of the users. While high-resource languages have abundant online resources, the situation is less than ideal for very low-resource languages. Moreover, the insufficient reporting of vital national and international events continues to be a worry, especially in languages with scarce resources, like \textbf{Mizo}. In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate the effectiveness of a simple methodology designed to generate a holistic summary for Mizo news articles, which leverages English-language news to supplement and enhance the information related to the corresponding news events. Furthermore, we make available 500 Mizo news articles and corresponding enriched holistic summaries. Human evaluation confirms that our approach significantly enhances the information coverage of Mizo news articles.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs) against malicious exploitation is paramount, with recent focus on mitigating offensive responses. Yet, the understanding of cant or dark jargon remains unexplored. This paper introduces a domain-specific Cant dataset and CantCounter evaluation framework, employing Fine-Tuning, Co-Tuning, Data-Diffusion, and Data-Analysis stages. Experiments reveal LLMs, including ChatGPT, are susceptible to cant bypassing filters, with varying recognition accuracy influenced by question types, setups, and prompt clues. Updated models exhibit higher acceptance rates for cant queries. Moreover, LLM reactions differ across domains, e.g., reluctance to engage in racism versus LGBT topics. These findings underscore LLMs' understanding of cant and reflect training data characteristics and vendor approaches to sensitive topics. Additionally, we assess LLMs' ability to demonstrate reasoning capabilities. Access to our datasets and code is available at https://github.com/cistineup/CantCounter.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00722">LLMs for Generating and Evaluating Counterfactuals: A Comprehensive Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Bach Nguyen, Paul Youssef, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: As NLP models become more complex, understanding their decisions becomes more crucial. Counterfactuals (CFs), where minimal changes to inputs flip a model's prediction, offer a way to explain these models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks, their efficacy in generating high-quality CFs remains uncertain. This work fills this gap by investigating how well LLMs generate CFs for two NLU tasks. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of several common LLMs, and evaluate their CFs, assessing both intrinsic metrics, and the impact of these CFs on data augmentation. Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated CFs, providing insights for future research directions. Our results show that LLMs generate fluent CFs, but struggle to keep the induced changes minimal. Generating CFs for Sentiment Analysis (SA) is less challenging than NLI where LLMs show weaknesses in generating CFs that flip the original label. This also reflects on the data augmentation performance, where we observe a large gap between augmenting with human and LLMs CFs. Furthermore, we evaluate LLMs' ability to assess CFs in a mislabelled data setting, and show that they have a strong bias towards agreeing with the provided labels. GPT4 is more robust against this bias and its scores correlate well with automatic metrics. Our findings reveal several limitations and point to potential future work directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dou Liu, Ying Han, Xiandi Wang, Xiaomei Tan, Di Liu, Guangwu Qian, Kang Li, Dan Pu, Rong Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents a transformative potential for enhancing operational efficiency and health outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their capabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical systems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential of ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been examined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient departments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency for outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both within-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low (mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in healthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs and AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors principles, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient triage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Zhao, Timothy Wang, Wael Abid, Geoffrey Angus, Arnav Garg, Jeffery Kinnison, Alex Sherstinsky, Piero Molino, Travis Addair, Devvret Rishi</p>
<p>Abstract: Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted methods for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters and memory usage while achieving comparable performance to full fine-tuning. We aim to assess the viability of training and serving LLMs fine-tuned with LoRA in real-world applications. First, we measure the quality of LLMs fine-tuned with quantized low rank adapters across 10 base models and 31 tasks for a total of 310 models. We find that 4-bit LoRA fine-tuned models outperform base models by 34 points and GPT-4 by 10 points on average. Second, we investigate the most effective base models for fine-tuning and assess the correlative and predictive capacities of task complexity heuristics in forecasting the outcomes of fine-tuning. Finally, we evaluate the latency and concurrency capabilities of LoRAX, an open-source Multi-LoRA inference server that facilitates the deployment of multiple LoRA fine-tuned models on a single GPU using shared base model weights and dynamic adapter loading. LoRAX powers LoRA Land, a web application that hosts 25 LoRA fine-tuned Mistral-7B LLMs on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB memory. LoRA Land highlights the quality and cost-effectiveness of employing multiple specialized LLMs over a single, general-purpose LLM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00801">&quot;Ask Me Anything&quot;: How Comcast Uses LLMs to Assist Agents in Real Time</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Rome, Tianwen Chen, Raphael Tang, Luwei Zhou, Ferhan Ture</p>
<p>Abstract: Customer service is how companies interface with their customers. It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction. However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or "chat bots". On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment.
  This raises the bar for customer service agents. They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once.
  In this work, we introduce "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface. AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations -- the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs. In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually. Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care.</p>

<p>Abstract: The behavior and decision making of groups or communities can be dramatically influenced by individuals pushing particular agendas, e.g., to promote or disparage a person or an activity, to call for action, etc.. In the examination of online influence campaigns, particularly those related to important political and social events, scholars often concentrate on identifying the sources responsible for setting and controlling the agenda (e.g., public media). In this article we present a methodology for detecting specific instances of agenda control through social media where annotated data is limited or non-existent. By using a modest corpus of Twitter messages centered on the 2022 French Presidential Elections, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of various approaches and techniques that can be applied to this problem. Our findings demonstrate that by treating the task as a textual entailment problem, it is possible to overcome the requirement for a large annotated training dataset.</p>

WorkBench contains a sandbox environment with five databases, 26 tools, and 690 tasks. These tasks represent common business activities, such as sending emails and scheduling meetings. The tasks in WorkBench are challenging as they require planning, tool selection, and often multiple actions. If a task has been successfully executed, one (or more) of the database values may change. The correct outcome for each task is unique and unambiguous, which allows for robust, automated evaluation. We call this key contribution outcome-centric evaluation. We evaluate five existing ReAct agents on WorkBench, finding they successfully complete as few as 3% of tasks (Llama2-70B), and just 43% for the best-performing (GPT-4). We further find that agents' errors can result in the wrong action being taken, such as an email being sent to the wrong person. WorkBench reveals weaknesses in agents' ability to undertake common business activities, raising questions about their use in high-stakes workplace settings. WorkBench is publicly available as a free resource at https://github.com/olly-styles/WorkBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arman Irani, Ju Yeon Park, Kevin Esterling, Michalis Faloutsos</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose WIBA, a novel framework and suite of methods that enable the comprehensive understanding of "What Is Being Argued" across contexts. Our approach develops a comprehensive framework that detects: (a) the existence, (b) the topic, and (c) the stance of an argument, correctly accounting for the logical dependence among the three tasks. Our algorithm leverages the fine-tuning and prompt-engineering of Large Language Models. We evaluate our approach and show that it performs well in all the three capabilities. First, we develop and release an Argument Detection model that can classify a piece of text as an argument with an F1 score between 79% and 86% on three different benchmark datasets. Second, we release a language model that can identify the topic being argued in a sentence, be it implicit or explicit, with an average similarity score of 71%, outperforming current naive methods by nearly 40%. Finally, we develop a method for Argument Stance Classification, and evaluate the capability of our approach, showing it achieves a classification F1 score between 71% and 78% across three diverse benchmark datasets. Our evaluation demonstrates that WIBA allows the comprehensive understanding of What Is Being Argued in large corpora across diverse contexts, which is of core interest to many applications in linguistics, communication, and social and computer science. To facilitate accessibility to the advancements outlined in this work, we release WIBA as a free open access platform (wiba.dev).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewook Lee, Digory Smith, Simon Woodhead, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are a popular method for evaluating students' knowledge due to their efficiency in administration and grading. Crafting high-quality math MCQs is a labor-intensive process that requires educators to formulate precise stems and plausible distractors. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in automating MCQ creation, but challenges persist in ensuring mathematical accuracy and addressing student errors. This paper introduces a prototype tool designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and educators for streamlining the math MCQ generation process. We conduct a pilot study involving math educators to investigate how the tool can help them simplify the process of crafting high-quality math MCQs. We found that while LLMs can generate well-formulated question stems, their ability to generate distractors that capture common student errors and misconceptions is limited. Nevertheless, a human-AI collaboration has the potential to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of MCQ generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shikhar Tuli, Chi-Heng Lin, Yen-Chang Hsu, Niraj K. Jha, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional language models operate autoregressively, i.e., they predict one token at a time. Rapid explosion in model sizes has resulted in high inference times. In this work, we propose DynaMo, a suite of multi-token prediction language models that reduce net inference times. Our models $\textit{dynamically}$ predict multiple tokens based on their confidence in the predicted joint probability distribution. We propose a lightweight technique to train these models, leveraging the weights of traditional autoregressive counterparts. Moreover, we propose novel ways to enhance the estimated joint probability to improve text generation quality, namely co-occurrence weighted masking and adaptive thresholding. We also propose systematic qualitative and quantitative methods to rigorously test the quality of generated text for non-autoregressive generation. One of the models in our suite, DynaMo-7.3B-T3, achieves same-quality generated text as the baseline (Pythia-6.9B) while achieving 2.57$\times$ speed-up with only 5.87% and 2.67% parameter and training time overheads, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayaz Mehmood, Muhammad Tayyab Zamir, Muhammad Asif Ayub, Nasir Ahmad, Kashif Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the last decade, similar to other application domains, social media content has been proven very effective in disaster informatics. However, due to the unstructured nature of the data, several challenges are associated with disaster analysis in social media content. To fully explore the potential of social media content in disaster informatics, access to relevant content and the correct geo-location information is very critical. In this paper, we propose a three-step solution to tackling these challenges. Firstly, the proposed solution aims to classify social media posts into relevant and irrelevant posts followed by the automatic extraction of location information from the posts' text through Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis. Finally, to quickly analyze the topics covered in large volumes of social media posts, we perform topic modeling resulting in a list of top keywords, that highlight the issues discussed in the tweet. For the Relevant Classification of Twitter Posts (RCTP), we proposed a merit-based fusion framework combining the capabilities of four different models namely BERT, RoBERTa, Distil BERT, and ALBERT obtaining the highest F1-score of 0.933 on a benchmark dataset. For the Location Extraction from Twitter Text (LETT), we evaluated four models namely BERT, RoBERTa, Distil BERTA, and Electra in an NER framework obtaining the highest F1-score of 0.960. For topic modeling, we used the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the relevant tweets. The experimental results of all the components of the proposed end-to-end solution are very encouraging and hint at the potential of social media content and NLP in disaster management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Yang, David Jurgens</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathy requires perspective-taking: empathetic responses require a person to reason about what another has experienced and communicate that understanding in language. However, most NLP approaches to empathy do not explicitly model this alignment process. Here, we introduce a new approach to recognizing alignment in empathetic speech, grounded in Appraisal Theory. We introduce a new dataset of over 9.2K span-level annotations of different types of appraisals of a person's experience and over 3K empathetic alignments between a speaker's and observer's speech. Through computational experiments, we show that these appraisals and alignments can be accurately recognized. In experiments in over 9.2M Reddit conversations, we find that appraisals capture meaningful groupings of behavior but that most responses have minimal alignment. However, we find that mental health professionals engage with substantially more empathetic alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Palmeira Ferraz</p>
<p>Abstract: Whisper is a multitask and multilingual speech model covering 99 languages. It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we examine its limitations, demonstrating the presence of speaker-related (gender, age) and model-related (resourcefulness and model size) bias. Despite that, we show that only model-related bias are amplified by quantization, impacting more low-resource languages and smaller models. Searching for a better compression approach, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach that is able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jionghao Lin, Zifei Han, Danielle R. Thomas, Ashish Gurung, Shivang Gupta, Vincent Aleven, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: One-on-one tutoring is widely acknowledged as an effective instructional method, conditioned on qualified tutors. However, the high demand for qualified tutors remains a challenge, often necessitating the training of novice tutors (i.e., trainees) to ensure effective tutoring. Research suggests that providing timely explanatory feedback can facilitate the training process for trainees. However, it presents challenges due to the time-consuming nature of assessing trainee performance by human experts. Inspired by the recent advancements of large language models (LLMs), our study employed the GPT-4 model to build an explanatory feedback system. This system identifies trainees' responses in binary form (i.e., correct/incorrect) and automatically provides template-based feedback with responses appropriately rephrased by the GPT-4 model. We conducted our study on 410 responses from trainees across three training lessons: Giving Effective Praise, Reacting to Errors, and Determining What Students Know. Our findings indicate that: 1) using a few-shot approach, the GPT-4 model effectively identifies correct/incorrect trainees' responses from three training lessons with an average F1 score of 0.84 and an AUC score of 0.85; and 2) using the few-shot approach, the GPT-4 model adeptly rephrases incorrect trainees' responses into desired responses, achieving performance comparable to that of human experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew D. McNaughton, Gautham Ramalaxmi, Agustin Kruel, Carter R. Knutson, Rohith A. Varikoti, Neeraj Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, but they often lack the ability to access and reason over domain-specific knowledge and tools. In this paper, we introduced CACTUS (Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science), an LLM-based agent that integrates cheminformatics tools to enable advanced reasoning and problem-solving in chemistry and molecular discovery. We evaluate the performance of CACTUS using a diverse set of open-source LLMs, including Gemma-7b, Falcon-7b, MPT-7b, Llama2-7b, and Mistral-7b, on a benchmark of thousands of chemistry questions. Our results demonstrate that CACTUS significantly outperforms baseline LLMs, with the Gemma-7b and Mistral-7b models achieving the highest accuracy regardless of the prompting strategy used. Moreover, we explore the impact of domain-specific prompting and hardware configurations on model performance, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering and the potential for deploying smaller models on consumer-grade hardware without significant loss in accuracy. By combining the cognitive capabilities of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS can assist researchers in tasks such as molecular property prediction, similarity searching, and drug-likeness assessment. Furthermore, CACTUS represents a significant milestone in the field of cheminformatics, offering an adaptable tool for researchers engaged in chemistry and molecular discovery. By integrating the strengths of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS has the potential to accelerate scientific advancement and unlock new frontiers in the exploration of novel, effective, and safe therapeutic candidates, catalysts, and materials. Moreover, CACTUS's ability to integrate with automated experimentation platforms and make data-driven decisions in real time opens up new possibilities for autonomous discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Niu, Ronglai Zuo, Brian Mak, Fangyun Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces TVB-HKSL-News, a new Hong Kong sign language (HKSL) dataset collected from a TV news program over a period of 7 months. The dataset is collected to enrich resources for HKSL and support research in large-vocabulary continuous sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT). It consists of 16.07 hours of sign videos of two signers with a vocabulary of 6,515 glosses (for SLR) and 2,850 Chinese characters or 18K Chinese words (for SLT). One signer has 11.66 hours of sign videos and the other has 4.41 hours. One objective in building the dataset is to support the investigation of how well large-vocabulary continuous sign language recognition/translation can be done for a single signer given a (relatively) large amount of his/her training data, which could potentially lead to the development of new modeling methods. Besides, most parts of the data collection pipeline are automated with little human intervention; we believe that our collection method can be scaled up to collect more sign language data easily for SLT in the future for any sign languages if such sign-interpreted videos are available. We also run a SOTA SLR/SLT model on the dataset and get a baseline SLR word error rate of 34.08% and a baseline SLT BLEU-4 score of 23.58 for benchmarking future research on the dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new ways to satisfy information needs. Although great strides have been made in applying them to settings like document ranking and short-form text generation, they still struggle to compose complete, accurate, and verifiable long-form reports. Reports with these qualities are necessary to satisfy the complex, nuanced, or multi-faceted information needs of users. In this perspective paper, we draw together opinions from industry and academia, and from a variety of related research areas, to present our vision for automatic report generation, and -- critically -- a flexible framework by which such reports can be evaluated. In contrast with other summarization tasks, automatic report generation starts with a detailed description of an information need, stating the necessary background, requirements, and scope of the report. Further, the generated reports should be complete, accurate, and verifiable. These qualities, which are desirable -- if not required -- in many analytic report-writing settings, require rethinking how to build and evaluate systems that exhibit these qualities. To foster new efforts in building these systems, we present an evaluation framework that draws on ideas found in various evaluations. To test completeness and accuracy, the framework uses nuggets of information, expressed as questions and answers, that need to be part of any high-quality generated report. Additionally, evaluation of citations that map claims made in the report to their source documents ensures verifiability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text understanding and generation, their potential for text clustering tasks remains underexplored. We observed that powerful closed-source LLMs provide good quality clusterings of entity sets but are not scalable due to the massive compute power required and the associated costs. Thus, we propose CACTUS (Context-Aware ClusTering with aUgmented triplet losS), a systematic approach that leverages open-source LLMs for efficient and effective supervised clustering of entity subsets, particularly focusing on text-based entities. Existing text clustering methods fail to effectively capture the context provided by the entity subset. Moreover, though there are several language modeling based approaches for clustering, very few are designed for the task of supervised clustering. This paper introduces a novel approach towards clustering entity subsets using LLMs by capturing context via a scalable inter-entity attention mechanism. We propose a novel augmented triplet loss function tailored for supervised clustering, which addresses the inherent challenges of directly applying the triplet loss to this problem. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised clustering task based on text augmentation techniques to improve the generalization of our model. For evaluation, we collect ground truth clusterings from a closed-source LLM and transfer this knowledge to an open-source LLM under the supervised clustering framework, allowing a faster and cheaper open-source model to perform the same task. Experiments on various e-commerce query and product clustering datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing unsupervised and supervised baselines under various external clustering evaluation metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Igbo language is facing a risk of becoming endangered, as indicated by a 2025 UNESCO study. This highlights the need to develop language technologies for Igbo to foster communication, learning and preservation. To create robust, impactful, and widely adopted language technologies for Igbo, it is essential to incorporate the multi-dialectal nature of the language. The primary obstacle in achieving dialectal-aware language technologies is the lack of comprehensive dialectal datasets. In response, we present the IgboAPI dataset, a multi-dialectal Igbo-English dictionary dataset, developed with the aim of enhancing the representation of Igbo dialects. Furthermore, we illustrate the practicality of the IgboAPI dataset through two distinct studies: one focusing on Igbo semantic lexicon and the other on machine translation. In the semantic lexicon project, we successfully establish an initial Igbo semantic lexicon for the Igbo semantic tagger, while in the machine translation study, we demonstrate that by finetuning existing machine translation systems using the IgboAPI dataset, we significantly improve their ability to handle dialectal variations in sentences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although pre-trained language models have exhibited great flexibility and versatility with prompt-based few-shot learning, they suffer from the extensive parameter size and limited applicability for inference. Recent studies have suggested that PLMs be used as dataset generators and a tiny task-specific model be trained to achieve efficient inference. However, their applicability to various domains is limited because they tend to generate domain-specific datasets. In this work, we propose a novel approach to universal domain generalization that generates a dataset regardless of the target domain. This allows for generalization of the tiny task model to any domain that shares the label space, thus enhancing the real-world applicability of the dataset generation paradigm. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method accomplishes generalizability across various domains while using a parameter set that is orders of magnitude smaller than PLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing methods for creating source-grounded information-seeking dialog datasets are often costly and hard to implement due to their sole reliance on human annotators. We propose combining large language models (LLMs) prompting with human expertise for more efficient and reliable data generation. Instead of the labor-intensive Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) method, where two annotators generate a dialog from scratch, role-playing agent and user, we use LLM generation to simulate the two roles. Annotators then verify the output and augment it with attribution data. We demonstrate our method by constructing MISeD -- Meeting Information Seeking Dialogs dataset -- the first information-seeking dialog dataset focused on meeting transcripts. Models finetuned with MISeD demonstrate superior performance on our test set, as well as on a novel fully-manual WOZ test set and an existing query-based summarization benchmark, suggesting the utility of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Active participation in a conversation is key to building common ground, since understanding is jointly tailored by producers and recipients. Overhearers are deprived of the privilege of performing grounding acts and can only conjecture about intended meanings. Still, data generation and annotation, modelling, training and evaluation of NLP dialogue models place reliance on the overhearing paradigm. How much of the underlying grounding processes are thereby forfeited? As we show, there is evidence pointing to the impossibility of properly modelling human meta-communicative acts with data-driven learning models. In this paper, we discuss this issue and provide a preliminary analysis on the variability of human decisions for requesting clarification. Most importantly, we wish to bring this topic back to the community's table, encouraging discussion on the consequences of having models designed to only "listen in".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Sun, Mingxiao Li, Jingyuan Sun, Jesse Davis, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Argument structure learning~(ASL) entails predicting relations between arguments. Because it can structure a document to facilitate its understanding, it has been widely applied in many fields~(medical, commercial, and scientific domains). Despite its broad utilization, ASL remains a challenging task because it involves examining the complex relationships between the sentences in a potentially unstructured discourse. To resolve this problem, we have developed a simple yet effective approach called Dual-tower Multi-scale cOnvolution neural Network~(DMON) for the ASL task. Specifically, we organize arguments into a relationship matrix that together with the argument embeddings forms a relationship tensor and design a mechanism to capture relations with contextual arguments. Experimental results on three different-domain argument mining datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models.

<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs), especially in the medical domain where specialized terminology and phrasing is used. However, the efficacy of prompt engineering in the medical domain remains to be explored. In this work, 114 recent studies (2022-2024) applying prompt engineering in medicine, covering prompt learning (PL), prompt tuning (PT), and prompt design (PD) are reviewed. PD is the most prevalent (78 articles). In 12 papers, PD, PL, and PT terms were used interchangeably. ChatGPT is the most commonly used LLM, with seven papers using it for processing sensitive clinical data. Chain-of-Thought emerges as the most common prompt engineering technique. While PL and PT articles typically provide a baseline for evaluating prompt-based approaches, 64% of PD studies lack non-prompt-related baselines. We provide tables and figures summarizing existing work, and reporting recommendations to guide future research contributions.</p>

However, a performance gap exists between NAR and autoregressive models due to the large decoding space and difficulty in capturing dependency between target words accurately. Compounding this, preparing appropriate training data for NAR models is a non-trivial task, often exacerbating exposure bias. To address these challenges, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to Levenshtein Transformer, a representative edit-based NAR model, demonstrating that RL with self-generated data can enhance the performance of edit-based NAR models. We explore two RL approaches: stepwise reward maximization and episodic reward maximization. We discuss the respective pros and cons of these two approaches and empirically verify them. Moreover, we experimentally investigate the impact of temperature setting on performance, confirming the importance of proper temperature setting for NAR models' training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liam Lonergan, Mengjie Qian, Neasa N\'i Chiar\'ain, Christer Gobl, Ailbhe N\'i Chasaide</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of Hybrid CTC/Attention encoder-decoder models trained with Intermediate CTC (InterCTC) for Irish (Gaelic) low-resource speech recognition (ASR) and dialect identification (DID). Results are compared to the current best performing models trained for ASR (TDNN-HMM) and DID (ECAPA-TDNN). An optimal InterCTC setting is initially established using a Conformer encoder. This setting is then used to train a model with an E-branchformer encoder and the performance of both architectures are compared. A multi-task fine-tuning approach is adopted for language model (LM) shallow fusion. The experiments yielded an improvement in DID accuracy of 10.8% relative to a baseline ECAPA-TDNN, and WER performance approaching the TDNN-HMM model. This multi-task approach emerges as a promising strategy for Irish low-resource ASR and DID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maja Pavlovic, Massimo Poesio</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful support tools across various natural language tasks and a range of application domains. Recent studies focus on exploring their capabilities for data annotation. This paper provides a comparative overview of twelve studies investigating the potential of LLMs in labelling data. While the models demonstrate promising cost and time-saving benefits, there exist considerable limitations, such as representativeness, bias, sensitivity to prompt variations and English language preference. Leveraging insights from these studies, our empirical analysis further examines the alignment between human and GPT-generated opinion distributions across four subjective datasets. In contrast to the studies examining representation, our methodology directly obtains the opinion distribution from GPT. Our analysis thereby supports the minority of studies that are considering diverse perspectives when evaluating data annotation tasks and highlights the need for further research in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zhu, Shujian Huang, Fei Yuan, Cheng Chen, Jiajun Chen, Alexandra Birch</p>
<p>Abstract: Bridging the significant gap between large language model's English and non-English performance presents a great challenge. While some previous studies attempt to mitigate this gap with translated training data, the recently proposed question alignment approach leverages the model's English expertise to improve multilingual performance with minimum usage of expensive, error-prone translation. In this paper, we explore how broadly this method can be applied by examining its effects in reasoning with executable code and reasoning with common sense. We also explore how to apply this approach efficiently to extremely large language models using proxy-tuning. Experiment results on multilingual reasoning benchmarks mGSM, mSVAMP and xCSQA demonstrate that the question alignment approach can be used to boost multilingual performance across diverse reasoning scenarios, model families, and sizes. For instance, when applied to the LLaMA2 models, our method brings an average accuracy improvements of 12.2% on mGSM even with the 70B model. To understand the mechanism of its success, we analyze representation space, chain-of-thought and translation data scales, which reveals how question translation training strengthens language alignment within LLMs and shapes their working patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Mayet</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale machines like particle accelerators are usually run by a team of experienced operators. In case of a particle accelerator, these operators possess suitable background knowledge on both accelerator physics and the technology comprising the machine. Due to the complexity of the machine, particular subsystems of the machine are taken care of by experts, who the operators can turn to. In this work the reasoning and action (ReAct) prompting paradigm is used to couple an open-weights large language model (LLM) with a high-level machine control system framework and other tools, e.g. the electronic logbook or machine design documentation. By doing so, a multi-expert retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system is implemented, which assists operators in knowledge retrieval tasks, interacts with the machine directly if needed, or writes high level control system scripts. This consolidation of expert knowledge and machine interaction can simplify and speed up machine operation tasks for both new and experienced human operators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A. Dennis, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language explanations have become a proxy for evaluating explainable and multi-step Natural Language Inference (NLI) models. However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that augments a TP with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning, autoformalisation, and error correction mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs as well as to automatically enhance the quality of human-annotated explanations of variable complexity in different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patr\'icia Ferreira, Daniel Martins, Ana Alves, Catarina Silva, Hugo Gon\c{c}alo Oliveira</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of dialogue flows is a critical but time-consuming task when developing task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. We propose an approach for the unsupervised discovery of flows from dialogue history, thus making the process applicable to any domain for which such an history is available. Briefly, utterances are represented in a vector space and clustered according to their semantic similarity. Clusters, which can be seen as dialogue states, are then used as the vertices of a transition graph for representing the flows visually. We present concrete examples of flows, discovered from MultiWOZ, a public TOD dataset. We further elaborate on their significance and relevance for the underlying conversations and introduce an automatic validation metric for their assessment. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for extracting meaningful flows from task-oriented conversations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenting Zhao, Xiang Ren, Jack Hessel, Claire Cardie, Yejin Choi, Yuntian Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Chatbots such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT are now serving millions of users. Despite their widespread use, there remains a lack of public datasets showcasing how these tools are used by a population of users in practice. To bridge this gap, we offered free access to ChatGPT for online users in exchange for their affirmative, consensual opt-in to anonymously collect their chat transcripts and request headers. From this, we compiled WildChat, a corpus of 1 million user-ChatGPT conversations, which consists of over 2.5 million interaction turns. We compare WildChat with other popular user-chatbot interaction datasets, and find that our dataset offers the most diverse user prompts, contains the largest number of languages, and presents the richest variety of potentially toxic use-cases for researchers to study. In addition to timestamped chat transcripts, we enrich the dataset with demographic data, including state, country, and hashed IP addresses, alongside request headers. This augmentation allows for more detailed analysis of user behaviors across different geographical regions and temporal dimensions. Finally, because it captures a broad range of use cases, we demonstrate the dataset's potential utility in fine-tuning instruction-following models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arkadiy Saakyan, Shreyas Kulkarni, Tuhin Chakrabarty, Smaranda Muresan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in tasks requiring a fine-grained understanding of literal images and text, such as visual question-answering or visual entailment. However, there has been little exploration of these models' capabilities when presented with images and captions containing figurative phenomena such as metaphors or humor, the meaning of which is often implicit. To close this gap, we propose a new task and a high-quality dataset: Visual Figurative Language Understanding with Textual Explanations (V-FLUTE). We frame the visual figurative language understanding problem as an explainable visual entailment task, where the model has to predict whether the image (premise) entails a claim (hypothesis) and justify the predicted label with a textual explanation. Using a human-AI collaboration framework, we build a high-quality dataset, V-FLUTE, that contains 6,027 <image, claim, label, explanation> instances spanning five diverse multimodal figurative phenomena: metaphors, similes, idioms, sarcasm, and humor. The figurative phenomena can be present either in the image, the caption, or both. We further conduct both automatic and human evaluations to assess current VLMs' capabilities in understanding figurative phenomena.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and preferences is essential for making them helpful and safe. However, building efficient tools to perform alignment can be challenging, especially for the largest and most competent LLMs which often contain tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. We create NeMo-Aligner, a toolkit for model alignment that can efficiently scale to using hundreds of GPUs for training. NeMo-Aligner comes with highly optimized and scalable implementations for major paradigms of model alignment such as: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SteerLM, and Self-Play Fine-Tuning (SPIN). Additionally, our toolkit supports running most of the alignment techniques in a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) setting. NeMo-Aligner is designed for extensibility, allowing support for other alignment techniques with minimal effort. It is open-sourced with Apache 2.0 License and we invite community contributions at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Ashok, Barnabas Poczos</p>
<p>Abstract: While most research on controllable text generation has focused on steering base Language Models, the emerging instruction-tuning and prompting paradigm offers an alternate approach to controllability. We compile and release ConGenBench, a testbed of 17 different controllable generation tasks, using a subset of it to benchmark the performance of 9 different baselines and methods on Instruction-tuned Language Models. To our surprise, we find that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such research, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding the range of constraints that can be studied in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijing Jin, Yuen Chen, Fernando Gonzalez, Jiarui Liu, Jiayi Zhang, Julian Michael, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Mona Diab</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems. In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs? Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps. To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments. We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction. We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasann Singhal, Nathan Lambert, Scott Niekum, Tanya Goyal, Greg Durrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Varied approaches for aligning language models have been proposed, including supervised fine-tuning, RLHF, and direct optimization methods such as DPO. Although DPO has rapidly gained popularity due to its straightforward training process and competitive results, there is an open question of whether there remain practical advantages of using a discriminator, like a reward model, to evaluate responses. We propose D2PO, discriminator-guided DPO, an approach for the online setting where preferences are being collected throughout learning. As we collect gold preferences, we use these not only to train our policy, but to train a discriminative response evaluation model to silver-label even more synthetic data for policy training. We explore this approach across a set of diverse tasks, including a realistic chat setting, we find that our approach leads to higher-quality outputs compared to DPO with the same data budget, and greater efficiency in terms of preference data requirements. Furthermore, we show conditions under which silver labeling is most helpful: it is most effective when training the policy with DPO, outperforming traditional PPO, and benefits from maintaining a separate discriminator from the policy model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Luyu Gao, Barlas Oguz, Wenhan Xiong, Jimmy Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Xilun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and more detailed responses. Based on these observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-following capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Proprietary LMs such as GPT-4 are often employed to assess the quality of responses from various LMs. However, concerns including transparency, controllability, and affordability strongly motivate the development of open-source LMs specialized in evaluations. On the other hand, existing open evaluator LMs exhibit critical shortcomings: 1) they issue scores that significantly diverge from those assigned by humans, and 2) they lack the flexibility to perform both direct assessment and pairwise ranking, the two most prevalent forms of assessment. Additionally, they do not possess the ability to evaluate based on custom evaluation criteria, focusing instead on general attributes like helpfulness and harmlessness. To address these issues, we introduce Prometheus 2, a more powerful evaluator LM than its predecessor that closely mirrors human and GPT-4 judgements. Moreover, it is capable of processing both direct assessment and pair-wise ranking formats grouped with a user-defined evaluation criteria. On four direct assessment benchmarks and four pairwise ranking benchmarks, Prometheus 2 scores the highest correlation and agreement with humans and proprietary LM judges among all tested open evaluator LMs. Our models, code, and data are all publicly available at https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the distributed systems landscape, Blockchain has catalyzed the rise of cryptocurrencies, merging enhanced security and decentralization with significant investment opportunities. Despite their potential, current research on cryptocurrency trend forecasting often falls short by simplistically merging sentiment data without fully considering the nuanced interplay between financial market dynamics and external sentiment influences. This paper presents a novel Dual Attention Mechanism (DAM) for forecasting cryptocurrency trends using multimodal time-series data. Our approach, which integrates critical cryptocurrency metrics with sentiment data from news and social media analyzed through CryptoBERT, addresses the inherent volatility and prediction challenges in cryptocurrency markets. By combining elements of distributed systems, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, our method outperforms conventional models like LSTM and Transformer by up to 20\% in prediction accuracy. This advancement deepens the understanding of distributed systems and has practical implications in financial markets, benefiting stakeholders in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Moreover, our enhanced forecasting approach can significantly support decentralized science (DeSci) by facilitating strategic planning and the efficient adoption of blockchain technologies, improving operational efficiency and financial risk management in the rapidly evolving digital asset domain, thus ensuring optimal resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Du, Tho V. Le</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis (SA) of comments on YouTube videos related to Sidewalk Delivery Robots (SDRs). We manually annotated the collected YouTube comments with three sentiment labels: negative (0), positive (1), and neutral (2). We then constructed models for text sentiment classification and tested the models' performance on both binary and ternary classification tasks in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results indicate that, in binary classification tasks, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and N-gram get the highest accuracy. In ternary classification tasks, the model using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) significantly outperforms other machine learning models, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.78. Additionally, we employ the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to generate 10 topics from the comments to explore the public's underlying views on SDRs. Drawing from these findings, we propose targeted recommendations for shaping future policies concerning SDRs. This work provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the SDR sector regarding social perception, interaction, and safety.</p>

We place particular emphasis on the applications of social robots: education, healthcare, and entertainment. Before being deployed in social robots, we also study how these language models could be safely trained to ``understand'' societal norms and issues, such as trust, bias, ethics, cognition, and teamwork.

<p>Abstract: There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Surabhi S. Nath, Peter Dayan, Claire Stevenson</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models appear quite creative, often performing on par with the average human on creative tasks. However, research on LLM creativity has focused solely on \textit{products}, with little attention on the creative \textit{process}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to LLMs. We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and LLMs explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. LLMs were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity. Our dataset and scripts are available on \href{https://github.com/surabhisnath/Creative_Process}{GitHub}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somesh Singh, Harini S I, Yaman K Singla, Veeky Baths, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Changyou Chen, Balaji Krishnamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication is defined as ``Who says what to whom with what effect.'' A message from a communicator generates downstream receiver effects, also known as behavior. Receiver behavior, being a downstream effect of the message, carries rich signals about it. Even after carrying signals about the message, the behavior data is often ignored while training large language models. We show that training LLMs on receiver behavior can actually help improve their content-understanding abilities. Specifically, we show that training LLMs to predict the receiver behavior of likes and comments improves the LLM's performance on a wide variety of downstream content understanding tasks. We show this performance increase over 40 video and image understanding tasks over 23 benchmark datasets across both 0-shot and fine-tuning settings, outperforming many supervised baselines. Moreover, since receiver behavior, such as likes and comments, is collected by default on the internet and does not need any human annotations to be useful, the performance improvement we get after training on this data is essentially free-lunch. We release the receiver behavior cleaned comments and likes of 750k images and videos collected from multiple platforms along with our instruction-tuning data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lee Youngmin, Lang S. I. D. Andrew, Cai Duoduo, Wheat R. Stephen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a systematic framework to compare the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for fine-tuning across various cheminformatics tasks. Employing a uniform training methodology, we assessed three well-known models-RoBERTa, BART, and LLaMA-on their ability to predict molecular properties using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) as a universal molecular representation format. Our comparative analysis involved pre-training 18 configurations of these models, with varying parameter sizes and dataset scales, followed by fine-tuning them on six benchmarking tasks from DeepChem. We maintained consistent training environments across models to ensure reliable comparisons. This approach allowed us to assess the influence of model type, size, and training dataset size on model performance. Specifically, we found that LLaMA-based models generally offered the lowest validation loss, suggesting their superior adaptability across tasks and scales. However, we observed that absolute validation loss is not a definitive indicator of model performance - contradicts previous research - at least for fine-tuning tasks: instead, model size plays a crucial role. Through rigorous replication and validation, involving multiple training and fine-tuning cycles, our study not only delineates the strengths and limitations of each model type but also provides a robust methodology for selecting the most suitable LLM for specific cheminformatics applications. This research underscores the importance of considering model architecture and dataset characteristics in deploying AI for molecular property prediction, paving the way for more informed and effective utilization of AI in drug discovery and related fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawn Lawrie, Efsun Kayi, Eugene Yang, James Mayfield, Douglas W. Oard</p>
<p>Abstract: PLAID, an efficient implementation of the ColBERT late interaction bi-encoder using pretrained language models for ranking, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in monolingual, cross-language, and multilingual retrieval. PLAID differs from ColBERT by assigning terms to clusters and representing those terms as cluster centroids plus compressed residual vectors. While PLAID is effective in batch experiments, its performance degrades in streaming settings where documents arrive over time because representations of new tokens may be poorly modeled by the earlier tokens used to select cluster centroids. PLAID Streaming Hierarchical Indexing that Runs on Terabytes of Temporal Text (PLAID SHIRTTT) addresses this concern using multi-phase incremental indexing based on hierarchical sharding. Experiments on ClueWeb09 and the multilingual NeuCLIR collection demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach both for the largest collection indexed to date by the ColBERT architecture and in the multilingual setting, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different languages, has shown the benefit of the Translate-Distill framework that trains a cross-language neural dual-encoder model using translation and distillation. However, Translate-Distill only supports a single document language. Multilingual information retrieval (MLIR), which ranks a multilingual document collection, is harder to train than CLIR because the model must assign comparable relevance scores to documents in different languages. This work extends Translate-Distill and propose Multilingual Translate-Distill (MTD) for MLIR. We show that ColBERT-X models trained with MTD outperform their counterparts trained ith Multilingual Translate-Train, which is the previous state-of-the-art training approach, by 5% to 25% in nDCG@20 and 15% to 45% in MAP. We also show that the model is robust to the way languages are mixed in training batches. Our implementation is available on GitHub.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00978">Language Fairness in Multilingual Information Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Yang, Thomas J\"anich, James Mayfield, Dawn Lawrie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) considers the problem of ranking documents in several languages for a query expressed in a language that may differ from any of those languages. Recent work has observed that approaches such as combining ranked lists representing a single document language each or using multilingual pretrained language models demonstrate a preference for one language over others. This results in systematic unfair treatment of documents in different languages. This work proposes a language fairness metric to evaluate whether documents across different languages are fairly ranked through statistical equivalence testing using the Kruskal-Wallis test. In contrast to most prior work in group fairness, we do not consider any language to be an unprotected group. Thus our proposed measure, PEER (Probability of EqualExpected Rank), is the first fairness metric specifically designed to capture the language fairness of MLIR systems. We demonstrate the behavior of PEER on artificial ranked lists. We also evaluate real MLIR systems on two publicly available benchmarks and show that the PEER scores align with prior analytical findings on MLIR fairness. Our implementation is compatible with ir-measures and is available at http://github.com/hltcoe/peer_measure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Eric Austin, Anton Korikov, Armin Toroghi, Scott Sanner</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing preference elicitation (PE) methodologies that can quickly ascertain a user's top item preferences in a cold-start setting is a key challenge for building effective and personalized conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems. While large language models (LLMs) constitute a novel technology that enables fully natural language (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches lack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively balance the NL exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an arbitrary item set. In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods define theoretically optimal PE strategies, but fail to use NL item descriptions or generate NL queries, unrealistically assuming users can express preferences with direct item ratings and comparisons. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that seeks to generate NL queries which actively elicit natural language feedback to reduce uncertainty over item utilities to identify the best recommendation. We demonstrate our framework in a novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) between user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain preference beliefs and BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling (TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to guide LLM query generation. We numerically evaluate our methods in controlled experiments, finding that PEBOL achieves up to 131% improvement in MAP@10 after 10 turns of cold start NL-PE dialogue compared to monolithic GPT-3.5, despite relying on a much smaller 400M parameter NLI model for preference inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Kumar, Chinmay Bharti, Saikat Dutta, Srikrishna Karanam, Biplab Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated remarkable performance comparable to human capabilities across various supervised computer vision tasks. However, the prevalent assumption of having an extensive pool of training data encompassing all classes prior to model training often diverges from real-world scenarios, where limited data availability for novel classes is the norm. The challenge emerges in seamlessly integrating new classes with few samples into the training data, demanding the model to adeptly accommodate these additions without compromising its performance on base classes. To address this exigency, the research community has introduced several solutions under the realm of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL).
  In this study, we introduce an innovative FSCIL framework that utilizes language regularizer and subspace regularizer. During base training, the language regularizer helps incorporate semantic information extracted from a Vision-Language model. The subspace regularizer helps in facilitating the model's acquisition of nuanced connections between image and text semantics inherent to base classes during incremental training. Our proposed framework not only empowers the model to embrace novel classes with limited data, but also ensures the preservation of performance on base classes. To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three distinct FSCIL benchmarks, where our framework attains state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitri Staufer, Frank Pallas, Bettina Berendt</p>
<p>Abstract: Whistleblowing is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in both public and private sectors. However, (potential) whistleblowers often fear or face retaliation, even when reporting anonymously. The specific content of their disclosures and their distinct writing style may re-identify them as the source. Legal measures, such as the EU WBD, are limited in their scope and effectiveness. Therefore, computational methods to prevent re-identification are important complementary tools for encouraging whistleblowers to come forward. However, current text sanitization tools follow a one-size-fits-all approach and take an overly limited view of anonymity. They aim to mitigate identification risk by replacing typical high-risk words (such as person names and other NE labels) and combinations thereof with placeholders. Such an approach, however, is inadequate for the whistleblowing scenario since it neglects further re-identification potential in textual features, including writing style. Therefore, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel classification and mitigation strategy for rewriting texts that involves the whistleblower in the assessment of the risk and utility. Our prototypical tool semi-automatically evaluates risk at the word/term level and applies risk-adapted anonymization techniques to produce a grammatically disjointed yet appropriately sanitized text. We then use a LLM that we fine-tuned for paraphrasing to render this text coherent and style-neutral. We evaluate our tool's effectiveness using court cases from the ECHR and excerpts from a real-world whistleblower testimony and measure the protection against authorship attribution (AA) attacks and utility loss statistically using the popular IMDb62 movie reviews dataset. Our method can significantly reduce AA accuracy from 98.81% to 31.22%, while preserving up to 73.1% of the original content's semantics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably the well-documented \textit{jailbreak} attack. Recently, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack has demonstrated efficacy in exploiting this vulnerability by optimizing adversarial prompts through a combination of gradient heuristics and greedy search. However, the efficiency of this attack has become a bottleneck in the attacking process. To mitigate this limitation, in this paper we rethink the generation of adversarial prompts through an optimization lens, aiming to stabilize the optimization process and harness more heuristic insights from previous iterations. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{M}omentum \textbf{A}ccelerated G\textbf{C}G (\textbf{MAC}) attack, which incorporates a momentum term into the gradient heuristic. Experimental results showcase the notable enhancement achieved by MAP in gradient-based attacks on aligned language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyao Feng, Anthony Hunter</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), is an important aspect of natural language understanding. Most research now uses machine learning and deep learning to perform this task on specific datasets, meaning their solution is not explainable nor explicit. To address the need for an explainable approach to RTE, we propose a novel pipeline that is based on translating text into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph. For this we use a pre-trained AMR parser. We then translate the AMR graph into propositional logic and use a SAT solver for automated reasoning. In text, often commonsense suggests that an entailment (or contradiction) relationship holds between a premise and a claim, but because different wordings are used, this is not identified from their logical representations. To address this, we introduce relaxation methods to allow replacement or forgetting of some propositions. Our experimental results show this pipeline performs well on four RTE datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tang, Xu Han, Xianzhi Li, Qiao Yu, Yixue Hao, Long Hu, Min Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large 2D vision-language models (2D-LLMs) have gained significant attention by bridging Large Language Models (LLMs) with images using a simple projector. Inspired by their success, large 3D point cloud-language models (3D-LLMs) also integrate point clouds into LLMs. However, directly aligning point clouds with LLM requires expensive training costs, typically in hundreds of GPU-hours on A100, which hinders the development of 3D-LLMs. In this paper, we introduce MiniGPT-3D, an efficient and powerful 3D-LLM that achieves multiple SOTA results while training for only 27 hours on one RTX 3090. Specifically, we propose to align 3D point clouds with LLMs using 2D priors from 2D-LLMs, which can leverage the similarity between 2D and 3D visual information. We introduce a novel four-stage training strategy for modality alignment in a cascaded way, and a mixture of query experts module to adaptively aggregate features with high efficiency. Moreover, we utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods LoRA and Norm fine-tuning, resulting in only 47.8M learnable parameters, which is up to 260x fewer than existing methods. Extensive experiments show that MiniGPT-3D achieves SOTA on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, with significantly cheaper training costs. Notably, MiniGPT-3D gains an 8.12 increase on GPT-4 evaluation score for the challenging object captioning task compared to ShapeLLM-13B, while the latter costs 160 total GPU-hours on 8 A800. We are the first to explore the efficient 3D-LLM, offering new insights to the community. Code and weights are available at https://github.com/TangYuan96/MiniGPT-3D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfu Jiang, Xuan He, Huaye Zeng, Cong Wei, Max Ku, Qian Liu, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks. However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved. The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective. In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources. Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding. We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks. Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points. We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks. We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2. Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, safeguarding the intellectual property of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial. Current watermarking techniques against model extraction attacks, which rely on signal insertion in model logits or post-processing of generated text, remain largely heuristic. We propose a novel method for embedding learnable linguistic watermarks in LLMs, aimed at tracing and preventing model extraction attacks. Our approach subtly modifies the LLM's output distribution by introducing controlled noise into token frequency distributions, embedding an statistically identifiable controllable watermark.We leverage statistical hypothesis testing and information theory, particularly focusing on Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to differentiate between original and modified distributions effectively. Our watermarking method strikes a delicate well balance between robustness and output quality, maintaining low false positive/negative rates and preserving the LLM's original performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Kahardipraja, Brielen Madureira, David Schlangen</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental processing allows interactive systems to respond based on partial inputs, which is a desirable property e.g. in dialogue agents. The currently popular Transformer architecture inherently processes sequences as a whole, abstracting away the notion of time. Recent work attempts to apply Transformers incrementally via restart-incrementality by repeatedly feeding, to an unchanged model, increasingly longer input prefixes to produce partial outputs. However, this approach is computationally costly and does not scale efficiently for long sequences. In parallel, we witness efforts to make Transformers more efficient, e.g. the Linear Transformer (LT) with a recurrence mechanism. In this work, we examine the feasibility of LT for incremental NLU in English. Our results show that the recurrent LT model has better incremental performance and faster inference speed compared to the standard Transformer and LT with restart-incrementality, at the cost of part of the non-incremental (full sequence) quality. We show that the performance drop can be mitigated by training the model to wait for right context before committing to an output and that training with input prefixes is beneficial for delivering correct partial outputs.</p>

Human evaluations indicate better fluency and naturalness compared to initial translations and even human references, all while maintaining quality. Ablation studies underscore the importance of anchoring the refinement to the source and a reasonable seed translation for quality considerations. We also discuss the challenges in evaluation and relation to human performance and translationese.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are popular for high-quality text generation but can produce harmful content, even when aligned with human values through reinforcement learning. Adversarial prompts can bypass their safety measures. We propose LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks by having an LLM screen the induced responses. Our method does not require any fine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we incorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another instance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. We test LLM Self Defense on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2, two of the current most prominent LLMs against various types of attacks, such as forcefully inducing affirmative responses to prompts and prompt engineering attacks. Notably, LLM Self Defense succeeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 using both GPT 3.5 and Llama 2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ofir Ben Shoham, Nadav Rappoport</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Clinical Prediction with Large Language Models (CPLLM), a method that involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for clinical disease and readmission prediction. We utilized quantization and fine-tuned the LLM using prompts. For diagnosis prediction, we predict whether patients will be diagnosed with a target disease during their next visit or in the subsequent diagnosis, leveraging their historical diagnosis records. We compared our results to various baselines, including RETAIN, and Med-BERT, the current state-of-the-art model for disease prediction using temporal structured EHR data. In addition, We also evaluated CPLLM for patient hospital readmission prediction and compared our method's performance with benchmark baselines. Our experiments have shown that our proposed method, CPLLM, surpasses all the tested models in terms of PR-AUC and ROC-AUC metrics, showing state-of-the-art results for diagnosis prediction and patient hospital readmission prediction. Such a method can be easily implemented and integrated into the clinical process to help care providers estimate the next steps of patients</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Ranaldi, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (It-LLMs) have been exhibiting outstanding abilities to reason around cognitive states, intentions, and reactions of all people involved, letting humans guide and comprehend day-to-day social interactions effectively. In fact, several multiple-choice questions (MCQ) benchmarks have been proposed to construct solid assessments of the models' abilities. However, earlier works are demonstrating the presence of inherent "order bias" in It-LLMs, posing challenges to the appropriate evaluation. In this paper, we investigate It-LLMs' resilience abilities towards a series of probing tests using four MCQ benchmarks. Introducing adversarial examples, we show a significant performance gap, mainly when varying the order of the choices, which reveals a selection bias and brings into discussion reasoning abilities. Following a correlation between first positions and model choices due to positional bias, we hypothesized the presence of structural heuristics in the decision-making process of the It-LLMs, strengthened by including significant examples in few-shot scenarios. Finally, by using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique, we elicit the model to reason and mitigate the bias by obtaining more robust models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creoles represent an under-explored and marginalized group of languages, with few available resources for NLP research.While the genealogical ties between Creoles and a number of highly-resourced languages imply a significant potential for transfer learning, this potential is hampered due to this lack of annotated data. In this work we present CreoleVal, a collection of benchmark datasets spanning 8 different NLP tasks, covering up to 28 Creole languages; it is an aggregate of novel development datasets for reading comprehension, relation classification, and machine translation for Creoles, in addition to a practical gateway to a handful of preexisting benchmarks. For each benchmark, we conduct baseline experiments in a zero-shot setting in order to further ascertain the capabilities and limitations of transfer learning for Creoles. Ultimately, we see CreoleVal as an opportunity to empower research on Creoles in NLP and computational linguistics, and in general, a step towards more equitable language technology around the globe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dou Hu, Lingwei Wei, Yaxin Liu, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new supervised representation learning framework, namely structured probabilistic coding (SPC), to learn compact and informative representations from input related to the target task. SPC is an encoder-only probabilistic coding technology with a structured regularization from the target space. It can enhance the generalization ability of pre-trained language models for better language understanding. Specifically, our probabilistic coding simultaneously performs information encoding and task prediction in one module to more fully utilize the effective information from input data. It uses variational inference in the output space to reduce randomness and uncertainty. Besides, to better control the learning process of probabilistic representations, a structured regularization is proposed to promote uniformity across classes in the latent space. With the regularization term, SPC can preserve the Gaussian structure of the latent code and achieve better coverage of the hidden space with class uniformly. Experimental results on 12 natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that our SPC effectively improves the performance of pre-trained language models for classification and regression. Extensive experiments show that SPC can enhance the generalization capability, robustness to label noise, and clustering quality of output representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li, Zhiyu Zoey Chen, Mike Ross, Patrick Huber, Seungwhan Moon, Zhaojiang Lin, Xin Luna Dong, Adithya Sagar, Xifeng Yan, Paul A. Crook</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities. We have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/FnCTOD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matan Avitan, Ryan Cotterell, Yoav Goldberg, Shauli Ravfogel</p>
<p>Abstract: Interventions targeting the representation space of language models (LMs) have emerged as an effective means to influence model behavior. Such methods are employed, for example, to eliminate or alter the encoding of demographic information such as gender within the model's representations and, in so doing, create a counterfactual representation. However, because the intervention operates within the representation space, understanding precisely what aspects of the text it modifies poses a challenge. In this paper, we give a method to convert representation counterfactuals into string counterfactuals. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to analyze the linguistic alterations corresponding to a given representation space intervention and to interpret the features utilized to encode a specific concept. Moreover, the resulting counterfactuals can be used to mitigate bias in classification through data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Grand, Valerio Pepe, Jacob Andreas, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Questions combine our mastery of language with our remarkable facility for reasoning about uncertainty. How do people navigate vast hypothesis spaces to pose informative questions given limited cognitive resources? We study these tradeoffs in a classic grounded question-asking task based on the board game Battleship. Our language-informed program sampling (LIPS) model uses large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language questions, translate them into symbolic programs, and evaluate their expected information gain. We find that with a surprisingly modest resource budget, this simple Monte Carlo optimization strategy yields informative questions that mirror human performance across varied Battleship board scenarios. In contrast, LLM-only baselines struggle to ground questions in the board state; notably, GPT-4V provides no improvement over non-visual baselines. Our results illustrate how Bayesian models of question-asking can leverage the statistics of language to capture human priors, while highlighting some shortcomings of pure LLMs as grounded reasoners.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Expert-Token-Routing, a unified generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration of multiple expert LLMs. Our framework represents expert LLMs as special expert tokens within the vocabulary of a meta LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vagrant Gautam, Eileen Bingert, Dawei Zhu, Anne Lauscher, Dietrich Klakow</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust, faithful and harm-free pronoun use for individuals is an important goal for language models as their use increases, but prior work tends to study only one or two of these characteristics at a time. To measure progress towards the combined goal, we introduce the task of pronoun fidelity: given a context introducing a co-referring entity and pronoun, the task is to reuse the correct pronoun later. We present RUFF, a carefully-designed dataset of over 5 million instances to measure robust pronoun fidelity in English, and we evaluate 37 popular large language models across architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder) and scales (11M-70B parameters). When an individual is introduced with a pronoun, models can mostly faithfully reuse this pronoun in the next sentence, but they are significantly worse with she/her/her, singular they and neopronouns. Moreover, models are easily distracted by non-adversarial sentences discussing other people; even one additional sentence with a distractor pronoun causes accuracy to drop on average by 34%. Our results show that pronoun fidelity is neither robust, nor due to reasoning, in a simple, naturalistic setting where humans achieve nearly 100% accuracy. We encourage researchers to bridge the gaps we find and to carefully evaluate reasoning in settings where superficial repetition might inflate perceptions of model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liao, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent and integrated into autonomous systems, ensuring their safety is imperative. Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete token optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99\% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hantian Ding, Zijian Wang, Giovanni Paolini, Varun Kumar, Anoop Deoras, Dan Roth, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: In large language model training, input documents are typically concatenated together and then split into sequences of equal length to avoid padding tokens. Despite its efficiency, the concatenation approach compromises data integrity -- it inevitably breaks many documents into incomplete pieces, leading to excessive truncations that hinder the model from learning to compose logically coherent and factually consistent content that is grounded on the complete context. To address the issue, we propose Best-fit Packing, a scalable and efficient method that packs documents into training sequences through length-aware combinatorial optimization. Our method completely eliminates unnecessary truncations while retaining the same training efficiency as concatenation. Empirical results from both text and code pre-training show that our method achieves superior performance (e.g., relatively +4.7% on reading comprehension; +16.8% in context following; and +9.2% on program synthesis), and reduces closed-domain hallucination effectively by up to 58.3%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reproducibility and transparency of large language models are crucial for advancing open research, ensuring the trustworthiness of results, and enabling investigations into data and model biases, as well as potential risks. To this end, we release OpenELM, a state-of-the-art open language model. OpenELM uses a layer-wise scaling strategy to efficiently allocate parameters within each layer of the transformer model, leading to enhanced accuracy. For example, with a parameter budget of approximately one billion parameters, OpenELM exhibits a 2.36% improvement in accuracy compared to OLMo while requiring $2\times$ fewer pre-training tokens.
  Diverging from prior practices that only provide model weights and inference code, and pre-train on private datasets, our release includes the complete framework for training and evaluation of the language model on publicly available datasets, including training logs, multiple checkpoints, and pre-training configurations. We also release code to convert models to MLX library for inference and fine-tuning on Apple devices. This comprehensive release aims to empower and strengthen the open research community, paving the way for future open research endeavors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Stowe, Benny Longwill, Alyssa Francis, Tatsuya Aoyama, Debanjan Ghosh, Swapna Somasundaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language generation tools are powerful and effective for generating content. However, language models are known to display bias and fairness issues, making them impractical to deploy for many use cases. We here focus on how fairness issues impact automatically generated test content, which can have stringent requirements to ensure the test measures only what it was intended to measure. Specifically, we review test content generated for a large-scale standardized English proficiency test with the goal of identifying content that only pertains to a certain subset of the test population as well as content that has the potential to be upsetting or distracting to some test takers. Issues like these could inadvertently impact a test taker's score and thus should be avoided. This kind of content does not reflect the more commonly-acknowledged biases, making it challenging even for modern models that contain safeguards. We build a dataset of 601 generated texts annotated for fairness and explore a variety of methods for classification: fine-tuning, topic-based classification, and prompting, including few-shot and self-correcting prompts. We find that combining prompt self-correction and few-shot learning performs best, yielding an F1 score of 0.79 on our held-out test set, while much smaller BERT- and topic-based models have competitive performance on out-of-domain data.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the field of Legal Tech has risen in prevalence, as the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and legal disciplines have combined forces to digitalize legal processes. Amidst the steady flow of research solutions stemming from the NLP domain, the study of use cases has fallen behind, leading to a number of innovative technical methods without a place in practice. In this work, we aim to build a structured overview of Legal Tech use cases, grounded in NLP literature, but also supplemented by voices from legal practice in Germany. Based upon a Systematic Literature Review, we identify seven categories of NLP technologies for the legal domain, which are then studied in juxtaposition to 22 legal use cases. In the investigation of these use cases, we identify 15 ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA), shedding light on the potential concerns of digitally transforming the legal domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Dong, Dayi Lin, Shaowei Wang, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also pose ethical and societal risks due to their propensity to generate harmful content. To address this, various approaches have been developed to safeguard LLMs from producing unsafe content. However, existing methods have limitations, including the need for training specific control models and proactive intervention during text generation, that lead to quality degradation and increased computational overhead. To mitigate those limitations, we propose LLMSafeGuard, a lightweight framework to safeguard LLM text generation in real-time. LLMSafeGuard integrates an external validator into the beam search algorithm during decoding, rejecting candidates that violate safety constraints while allowing valid ones to proceed. We introduce a similarity based validation approach, simplifying constraint introduction and eliminating the need for control model training. Additionally, LLMSafeGuard employs a context-wise timing selection strategy, intervening LLMs only when necessary. We evaluate LLMSafeGuard on two tasks, detoxification and copyright safeguarding, and demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA baselines. For instance, LLMSafeGuard reduces the average toxic score of. LLM output by 29.7% compared to the best baseline meanwhile preserving similar linguistic quality as natural output in detoxification task. Similarly, in the copyright task, LLMSafeGuard decreases the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) by 56.2% compared to baselines. Moreover, our context-wise timing selection strategy reduces inference time by at least 24% meanwhile maintaining comparable effectiveness as validating each time step. LLMSafeGuard also offers tunable parameters to balance its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been actively studied and deployed across various industries to query on domain-specific knowledge base. However, evaluating these systems presents unique challenges due to the scarcity of domain-specific queries and corresponding ground truths, as well as a lack of systematic approaches to diagnosing the cause of failure cases -- whether they stem from knowledge deficits or issues related to system robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce GRAMMAR (GRounded And Modular Methodology for Assessment of RAG), an evaluation framework comprising two key elements: 1) a data generation process that leverages relational databases and LLMs to efficiently produce scalable query-answer pairs. This method facilitates the separation of query logic from linguistic variations for enhanced debugging capabilities; and 2) an evaluation framework that differentiates knowledge gaps from robustness and enables the identification of defective modules. Our empirical results underscore the limitations of current reference-free evaluation approaches and the reliability of GRAMMAR to accurately identify model vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the deployment of NLP systems in critical applications grows, ensuring the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks becomes increasingly important. Large language models excel in various NLP tasks but remain vulnerable to low-cost adversarial attacks. Focusing on the domain of conversation entailment, where multi-turn dialogues serve as premises to verify hypotheses, we fine-tune a transformer model to accurately discern the truthfulness of these hypotheses. Adversaries manipulate hypotheses through synonym swapping, aiming to deceive the model into making incorrect predictions. To counteract these attacks, we implemented innovative fine-tuning techniques and introduced an embedding perturbation loss method to significantly bolster the model's robustness. Our findings not only emphasize the importance of defending against adversarial attacks in NLP but also highlight the real-world implications, suggesting that enhancing model robustness is critical for reliable NLP applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasnain Heickal, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: In feedback generation for logical errors in programming assignments, large language model (LLM)-based methods have shown great promise. These methods ask the LLM to generate feedback given the problem statement and a student's (buggy) submission. There are several issues with these types of methods. First, the generated feedback messages are often too direct in revealing the error in the submission and thus diminish valuable opportunities for the student to learn. Second, they do not consider the student's learning context, i.e., their previous submissions, current knowledge, etc. Third, they are not layered since existing methods use a single, shared prompt for all student submissions. In this paper, we explore using LLMs to generate a "feedback-ladder", i.e., multiple levels of feedback for the same problem-submission pair. We evaluate the quality of the generated feedback-ladder via a user study with students, educators, and researchers. We have observed diminishing effectiveness for higher-level feedback and higher-scoring submissions overall in the study. In practice, our method enables teachers to select an appropriate level of feedback to show to a student based on their personal learning context, or in a progressive manner to go more detailed if a higher-level feedback fails to correct the student's error.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingchen Li, Halil Kilicoglu, Hua Xu, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have swiftly emerged as vital resources for different applications in the biomedical and healthcare domains; however, these models encounter issues such as generating inaccurate information or hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation provided a solution for these models to update knowledge and enhance their performance. In contrast to previous retrieval-augmented LMs, which utilize specialized cross-attention mechanisms to help LLM encode retrieved text, BiomedRAG adopts a simpler approach by directly inputting the retrieved chunk-based documents into the LLM. This straightforward design is easily applicable to existing retrieval and language models, effectively bypassing noise information in retrieved documents, particularly in noise-intensive tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for utilizing the LLM to supervise the retrieval model in the biomedical domain, enabling it to retrieve the document that assists the LM in improving its predictions. Our experiments reveal that with the tuned scorer,\textsc{ BiomedRAG} attains superior performance across 5 biomedical NLP tasks, encompassing information extraction (triple extraction, relation extraction), text classification, link prediction, and question-answering, leveraging over 9 datasets. For instance, in the triple extraction task, \textsc{BiomedRAG} outperforms other triple extraction systems with micro-F1 scores of 81.42 and 88.83 on GIT and ChemProt corpora, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Jonathan Katz, Ian Miers, Tom Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of "green" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Manli Shu, Khalid Saifullah, Kezhi Kong, Kasun Fernando, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, Tom Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jackie Junrui Yang, Yingtian Shi, Yuhan Zhang, Karina Li, Daniel Wan Rosli, Anisha Jain, Shuning Zhang, Tianshi Li, James A. Landay, Monica S. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: By combining voice and touch interactions, multimodal interfaces can surpass the efficiency of either modality alone. Traditional multimodal frameworks require laborious developer work to support rich multimodal commands where the user's multimodal command involves possibly exponential combinations of actions/function invocations. This paper presents ReactGenie, a programming framework that better separates multimodal input from the computational model to enable developers to create efficient and capable multimodal interfaces with ease. ReactGenie translates multimodal user commands into NLPL (Natural Language Programming Language), a programming language we created, using a neural semantic parser based on large-language models. The ReactGenie runtime interprets the parsed NLPL and composes primitives in the computational model to implement complex user commands. As a result, ReactGenie allows easy implementation and unprecedented richness in commands for end-users of multimodal apps. Our evaluation showed that 12 developers can learn and build a nontrivial ReactGenie application in under 2.5 hours on average. In addition, compared with a traditional GUI, end-users can complete tasks faster and with less task load using ReactGenie apps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Thomas, Seth Spielman, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.
  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality ``gold'' labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step introduces potential information loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing. It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we introduce LMIndexer, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective. We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled the development of viable generative retrieval systems. Instead of a traditional document ranking, many generative retrieval systems directly return a grounded generated text as an answer to an information need expressed as a query or question. Quantifying the utility of the textual responses is essential for appropriately evaluating such generative ad hoc retrieval. Yet, the established evaluation methodology for ranking-based retrieval is not suited for reliable, repeatable, and reproducible evaluation of generated answers. In this paper, we survey the relevant literature from the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing, we identify search tasks and system architectures in generative retrieval, we develop a corresponding user model, and we study its operationalization. Our analysis provides a foundation and new insights for the evaluation of generative retrieval systems, focusing on ad hoc retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this ``curse of memory'' as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04469">On the Learnability of Watermarks for Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Gu, Xiang Lisa Li, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking of language model outputs enables statistical detection of model-generated text, which can mitigate harms and misuses of language models. Existing watermarking strategies operate by altering the decoder of an existing language model. In this paper, we ask whether language models can directly learn to generate watermarked text, which would have significant implications for the real-world deployment of watermarks. First, learned watermarks could be used to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, enabling watermarking for open models, where users can control the decoding procedure. Second, if watermarking is used to determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the reputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging watermarked text. To investigate the learnability of watermarks, we propose watermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher model that uses decoding-based watermarking. We test our approach on three decoding-based watermarking strategies and various hyperparameter settings, finding that models can learn to generate watermarked text with high detectability. We also find limitations to learnability, including the loss of watermarking capabilities under fine-tuning on normal text and high sample complexity when learning low-distortion watermarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixi Song, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Hai Zhao, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: With the prevalence of pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm, how to efficiently adapt the pre-trained model to the downstream tasks has been an intriguing issue. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed for low-cost adaptation. Although PEFT has demonstrated effectiveness and been widely applied, the underlying principles are still unclear. In this paper, we adopt the PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound, viewing pre-training as a shift of prior distribution which leads to a tighter bound for generalization error. We validate this shift from the perspectives of oscillations in the loss landscape and the quasi-sparsity in gradient distribution. Based on this, we propose a gradient-based sparse fine-tuning algorithm, named Sparse Increment Fine-Tuning (SIFT), and validate its effectiveness on a range of tasks including the GLUE Benchmark and Instruction-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, \textbf{Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC)}, that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Liquori, Michael Mendler</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the standard theory of process algebra with priorities, we identify a new scheduling mechanism, called "constructive reduction" which is designed to capture the essence of synchronous programming. The distinctive property of this evaluation strategy is to achieve determinacy-by-construction for multi-cast concurrent communication with shared memory. In the technical setting of CCS extended by clocks and priorities, we prove for a large class of "coherent" processes a confluence property for constructive reductions. We show that under some restrictions, called "pivotability", coherence is preserved by the operators of prefix, summation, parallel composition, restriction and hiding. Since this permits memory and sharing, we are able to cover a strictly larger class of processes compared to those in Milner's classical confluence theory for CCS without priorities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model pre-training has become increasingly expensive, with most practitioners relying on scaling laws to allocate compute budgets for model size and training tokens, commonly referred to as Compute-Optimal or Chinchilla Optimal. In this paper, we hypothesize a new scaling law that suggests model performance depends mostly on the amount of compute spent for transformer-based models, independent of the specific allocation to model size and dataset size. Using this unified scaling law, we predict that (a) for inference efficiency, training should prioritize smaller model sizes and larger training datasets, and (b) assuming the exhaustion of available web datasets, scaling the model size might be the only way to further improve model performance.</p>
