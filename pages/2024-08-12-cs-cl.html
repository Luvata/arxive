<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Qian, Yisi Sang, Farima Fatahi Bayat, Anton Belyi, Xianqi Chu, Yash Govind, Samira Khorshidi, Rahul Khot, Katherine Luna, Azadeh Nikfarjam, Xiaoguang Qi, Fei Wu, Xianhan Zhang, Yunyao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is an iterative procedure often requiring extensive manual effort to formulate suitable instructions for effectively directing large language models (LLMs) in specific tasks. Incorporating few-shot examples is a vital and effective approach to providing LLMs with precise instructions, leading to improved LLM performance. Nonetheless, identifying the most informative demonstrations for LLMs is labor-intensive, frequently entailing sifting through an extensive search space. In this demonstration, we showcase a human-in-the-loop tool called APE (Active Prompt Engineering) designed for refining prompts through active learning. Drawing inspiration from active learning, APE iteratively selects the most ambiguous examples for human feedback, which will be transformed into few-shot examples within the prompt.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Zhang, Xiaocui Yang, Xingle Xu, Zeran Gao, Yijie Huang, Shiyi Mu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Kaisong Song, Ge Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Affective Computing (AC), integrating computer science, psychology, and cognitive science knowledge, aims to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions.To create more value, AC can be applied to diverse scenarios, including social media, finance, healthcare, education, etc. Affective Computing (AC) includes two mainstream tasks, i.e., Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for AU tasks has succeeded considerably. However, these models lack generalization ability, requiring specialized models for specific tasks. Additionally, traditional PLMs face challenges in AG, particularly in generating diverse and emotionally rich responses. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ChatGPT series and LLaMA models, brings new opportunities and challenges, catalyzing a paradigm shift in AC. LLMs possess capabilities of in-context learning, common sense reasoning, and advanced sequence generation, which present unprecedented opportunities for AU. To provide a comprehensive overview of AC in the LLMs era from an NLP perspective, we summarize the development of LLMs research in this field, aiming to offer new insights. Specifically, we first summarize the traditional tasks related to AC and introduce the preliminary study based on LLMs. Subsequently, we outline the relevant techniques of popular LLMs to improve AC tasks, including Instruction Tuning and Prompt Engineering. For Instruction Tuning, we discuss full parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-Tuning, and Prompt Tuning. In Prompt Engineering, we examine Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought (CoT), and Agent-based methods for AU and AG. To clearly understand the performance of LLMs on different Affective Computing tasks, we further summarize the existing benchmarks and evaluation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilia Derkach</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, large language models are gaining popularity, their achievements are used in many areas, ranging from text translation to generating answers to queries. However, the main problem with these new machine learning algorithms is that training such models requires large computing resources that only large IT companies have. To avoid this problem, a number of methods (LoRA, quantization) have been proposed so that existing models can be effectively fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an E2E (end to end) audio summarization model using these techniques. In addition, this paper examines the effectiveness of these approaches to the problem under consideration and draws conclusions about the applicability of these methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji-jun Park, Soo-joon Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Agricultural meteorological recommendations are crucial for enhancing crop productivity and sustainability by providing farmers with actionable insights based on weather forecasts, soil conditions, and crop-specific data. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to improve the accuracy and relevance of these recommendations. We designed a multi-round prompt framework to iteratively refine recommendations using updated data and feedback, implemented on ChatGPT, Claude2, and GPT-4. Our method was evaluated against baseline models and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach using manually collected datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and contextual relevance, with our approach achieving up to 90\% accuracy and high GPT-4 scores. Additional validation through real-world pilot studies further confirmed the practical benefits of our method, highlighting its potential to transform agricultural practices and decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritabrata Roy Choudhury, Soumik Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: This work uses the state-of-the-art language model GPT-3 to offer a novel method of information extraction for knowledge base development. The suggested method attempts to solve the difficulties associated with obtaining relevant entities and relationships from unstructured text in order to extract structured information. We conduct experiments on a huge corpus of text from diverse fields to assess the performance of our suggested technique. The evaluation measures, which are frequently employed in information extraction tasks, include precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to efficiently and accurately extract pertinent and correct information from text, hence increasing the precision and productivity of knowledge base creation. We also assess how well our suggested approach performs in comparison to the most advanced information extraction techniques already in use. The findings show that by utilizing only a small number of instances in in-context learning, our suggested strategy yields competitive outcomes with notable savings in terms of data annotation and engineering expense. Additionally, we use our proposed method to retrieve Biomedical information, demonstrating its practicality in a real-world setting. All things considered, our suggested method offers a viable way to overcome the difficulties involved in obtaining structured data from unstructured text in order to create knowledge bases. It can greatly increase the precision and effectiveness of information extraction, which is necessary for many applications including chatbots, recommendation engines, and question-answering systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Nazmus Sakib, Md Athikul Islam, Royal Pathak, Md Mashrur Arifin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, have significantly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their outstanding abilities in text generation, summarization, and classification. Nevertheless, their widespread adoption introduces numerous challenges, including issues related to academic integrity, copyright, environmental impacts, and ethical considerations such as data bias, fairness, and privacy. The rapid evolution of LLMs also raises concerns regarding the reliability and generalizability of their evaluations. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the literature on these subjects, systematically gathered and synthesized from Google Scholar. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the risks associated with specific LLMs, identifying sub-risks, their causes, and potential solutions. Furthermore, we explore the broader challenges related to LLMs, detailing their causes and proposing mitigation strategies. Through this literature analysis, our survey aims to deepen the understanding of the implications and complexities surrounding these powerful models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04645">Evaluating the Impact of Advanced LLM Techniques on AI-Lecture Tutors for a Robotics Course</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Kahl, Felix L\"offler, Martin Maciol, Fabian Ridder, Marius Schmitz, Jennifer Spanagel, Jens Wienkamp, Christopher Burgahn, Malte Schilling</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an Artificial Intelligence-based tutor for a university course. In particular, different advanced techniques are utilized, such as prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We assessed the different models and applied techniques using common similarity metrics like BLEU-4, ROUGE, and BERTScore, complemented by a small human evaluation of helpfulness and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate that RAG combined with prompt engineering significantly enhances model responses and produces better factual answers. In the context of education, RAG appears as an ideal technique as it is based on enriching the input of the model with additional information and material which usually is already present for a university course. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can produce quite small, still strong expert models, but poses the danger of overfitting. Our study further asks how we measure performance of LLMs and how well current measurements represent correctness or relevance? We find high correlation on similarity metrics and a bias of most of these metrics towards shorter responses. Overall, our research points to both the potential and challenges of integrating LLMs in educational settings, suggesting a need for balanced training approaches and advanced evaluation frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya Shah, Shridhar Mehendale, Siddha Kanthi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting existing literature through a systematic review of the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and financial performance. The primary objective is to assess how LLMs can replicate a systematic review on a corpus of ESG-focused papers. We compiled and hand-coded a database of 88 relevant papers published from March 2020 to May 2024. Additionally, we used a set of 238 papers from a previous systematic review of ESG literature from January 2015 to February 2020. We evaluated two current state-of-the-art LLMs, Meta AI's Llama 3 8B and OpenAI's GPT-4o, on the accuracy of their interpretations relative to human-made classifications on both sets of papers. We then compared these results to a "Custom GPT" and a fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model using the corpus of 238 papers as training data. The fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model outperformed the base LLMs by 28.3% on average in overall accuracy on prompt 1. At the same time, the "Custom GPT" showed a 3.0% and 15.7% improvement on average in overall accuracy on prompts 2 and 3, respectively. Our findings reveal promising results for investors and agencies to leverage LLMs to summarize complex evidence related to ESG investing, thereby enabling quicker decision-making and a more efficient market.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gauri Anil Godghase, Rishit Agrawal, Tanush Obili, Mark Stamp</p>
<p>Abstract: There have been many recent advances in the fields of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM), with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model being a leading "chatbot." LLM-based chatbots have become so powerful that it may seem difficult to differentiate between human-written and machine-generated text. To analyze this problem, we have developed a new dataset consisting of more than 750,000 human-written paragraphs, with a corresponding chatbot-generated paragraph for each. Based on this dataset, we apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the origin of text (human or chatbot). Specifically, we consider two methodologies for tackling this issue: feature analysis and embeddings. Our feature analysis approach involves extracting a collection of features from the text for classification. We also explore the use of contextual embeddings and transformer-based architectures to train classification models. Our proposed solutions offer high classification accuracy and serve as useful tools for textual analysis, resulting in a better understanding of chatbot-generated text in this era of advanced AI technology.</p>

Our evaluation of API-based and open-sourced LLMs shows that while some commercial LLMs exhibit strong reasoning abilities, open-sourced competitors can demonstrate almost the same level of quality; however, all models still have significant room for improvement. We identify typical reasons for LLM failures and discuss possible ways to deal with them. Datasets and evaluation code are released (https://github.com/altsoph/PLUGH).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxia Ma, Changjiang Wang, Hanwen Xing, Dongming Zhao, Yazhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection is an active task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to identify the author's stance towards a particular target within a text. Given the remarkable language understanding capabilities and encyclopedic prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs), how to explore the potential of LLMs in stance detection has received significant attention. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches that focus solely on fine-tuning with large-scale datasets, we propose a new prompting method, called \textit{Chain of Stance} (CoS). In particular, it positions LLMs as expert stance detectors by decomposing the stance detection process into a series of intermediate, stance-related assertions that culminate in the final judgment. This approach leads to significant improvements in classification performance. We conducted extensive experiments using four SOTA LLMs on the SemEval 2016 dataset, covering the zero-shot and few-shot learning setups. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 79.84 in the few-shot setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung In Park, Mahyar Abbasian, Iman Azimi, Dawn Bounds, Angela Jun, Jaesu Han, Robert McCarron, Jessica Borelli, Jia Li, Mona Mahmoudi, Carmen Wiedenhoeft, Amir Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: This project investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and extracting scientific knowledge across specific domains and to create a deep learning framework: Knowledge AI. As a part of this framework, we employ pre-trained models and fine-tune them on datasets in the scientific domain. The models are adapted for four key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: summarization, text generation, question answering, and named entity recognition. Our results indicate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances model performance in each of these tasks, thereby improving their applicability for scientific contexts. This adaptation enables non-experts to efficiently query and extract information within targeted scientific fields, demonstrating the potential of fine-tuned LLMs as a tool for knowledge discovery in the sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhen, Yucheng Shi, Yongcan Huang, Jidong J. Yang, Ninghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), this study explores the use of three state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and LLaMA3-70B, for crash severity inference, framing it as a classification task. We generate textual narratives from original traffic crash tabular data using a pre-built template infused with domain knowledge. Additionally, we incorporated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to guide the LLMs in analyzing the crash causes and then inferring the severity. This study also examine the impact of prompt engineering specifically designed for crash severity inference. The LLMs were tasked with crash severity inference to: (1) evaluate the models' capabilities in crash severity analysis, (2) assess the effectiveness of CoT and domain-informed prompt engineering, and (3) examine the reasoning abilities with the CoT framework. Our results showed that LLaMA3-70B consistently outperformed the other models, particularly in zero-shot settings. The CoT and Prompt Engineering techniques significantly enhanced performance, improving logical reasoning and addressing alignment issues. Notably, the CoT offers valuable insights into LLMs' reasoning processes, unleashing their capacity to consider diverse factors such as environmental conditions, driver behavior, and vehicle characteristics in severity analysis and inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander P. Morgan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Byte Pair Encoding algorithm can be safely batched to merge hundreds of pairs of tokens at a time when building up a tokenizer's vocabulary. This technique combined with reducing the memory footprint of text used in vocabulary training make it feasible to train a high quality tokenizer on a basic laptop. This paper presents BatchBPE, an open-source pure Python implementation of these concepts, with the goal of making experimenting with new tokenization strategies more accessible especially in compute- and memory-constrained contexts. BatchBPE's usefulness and malleability are demonstrated through the training of several token vocabularies to explore the batch merging process and experiment with preprocessing a stop word list and ignoring the least common text chunks in a dataset. Resultant encoded lengths of texts are used as a basic evaluation metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Khamassi, Marceau Nahon, Raja Chatila</p>
<p>Abstract: Minimizing negative impacts of Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems on human societies without human supervision requires them to be able to align with human values. However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call "the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luka Vre\v{c}ar, Joe Wells, Fairouz Kamareddine</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical documents written in LaTeX often contain ambiguities. We can resolve some of them via semantic markup using, e.g., sTeX, which also has other potential benefits, such as interoperability with computer algebra systems, proof systems, and increased accessibility. However, semantic markup is more involved than "regular" typesetting and presents a challenge for authors of mathematical documents. We aim to smooth out the transition from plain LaTeX to semantic markup by developing semi-automatic tools for authors. In this paper we present an approach to semantic markup of formulas by (semi-)automatically generating grammars from existing sTeX macro definitions and parsing mathematical formulas with them.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Deotte, Ivan Sorokin, Ahmet Erdem, Benedikt Schifferer, Gilberto Titericz Jr, Simon Jegou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes the winning solution of all 5 tasks for the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Multi Task Online Shopping Challenge for LLMs. The challenge was to build a useful assistant, answering questions in the domain of online shopping. The competition contained 57 diverse tasks, covering 5 different task types (e.g. multiple choice) and across 4 different tracks (e.g. multi-lingual). Our solution is a single model per track. We fine-tune Qwen2-72B-Instruct on our own training dataset. As the competition released only 96 example questions, we developed our own training dataset by processing multiple public datasets or using Large Language Models for data augmentation and synthetic data generation. We apply wise-ft to account for distribution shifts and ensemble multiple LoRA adapters in one model. We employed Logits Processors to constrain the model output on relevant tokens for the tasks. AWQ 4-bit Quantization and vLLM are used during inference to predict the test dataset in the time constraints of 20 to 140 minutes depending on the track. Our solution achieved the first place in each individual track and is the first place overall of Amazons KDD Cup 2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh T. V. Dau, Hieu Trung Dao, Anh Tuan Nguyen, Hieu Trung Tran, Phong X. Nguyen, Nghi D. Q. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainframe operating systems, despite their inception in the 1940s, continue to support critical sectors like finance and government. However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Riza Durmaz, Akhil Thomas, Lokesh Mishra, Rachana Niranjan Murthy, Thomas Straub</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models learn sound statistical representations of the language and information therein, ontologies are symbolic knowledge representations that can complement the former ideally. Research at this critical intersection relies on datasets that intertwine ontologies and text corpora to enable training and comprehensive benchmarking of neurosymbolic models. We present the MaterioMiner dataset and the linked materials mechanics ontology where ontological concepts from the mechanics of materials domain are associated with textual entities within the literature corpus. Another distinctive feature of the dataset is its eminently fine-granular annotation. Specifically, 179 distinct classes are manually annotated by three raters within four publications, amounting to a total of 2191 entities that were annotated and curated. Conceptual work is presented for the symbolic representation of causal composition-process-microstructure-property relationships. We explore the annotation consistency between the three raters and perform fine-tuning of pre-trained models to showcase the feasibility of named-entity recognition model training. Reusing the dataset can foster training and benchmarking of materials language models, automated ontology construction, and knowledge graph generation from textual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Shen, Tong Zhou, Suifeng Zhao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate citations in Question-Answering (QA) tasks is an emerging paradigm aimed at enhancing the verifiability of their responses when LLMs are utilizing external references to generate an answer. However, there is currently no unified framework to standardize and fairly compare different citation generation methods, leading to difficulties in reproducing different methods and a comprehensive assessment. To cope with the problems above, we introduce \name, an open-source and modular toolkit designed to facilitate the implementation and evaluation of existing citation generation methods, while also fostering the development of new approaches to improve citation quality in LLM outputs. This tool is highly extensible, allowing users to utilize 4 main modules and 14 components to construct a pipeline, evaluating an existing method or innovative designs. Our experiments with two state-of-the-art LLMs and 11 citation generation baselines demonstrate varying strengths of different modules in answer accuracy and citation quality improvement, as well as the challenge of enhancing granularity. Based on our analysis of the effectiveness of components, we propose a new method, self-RAG \snippet, obtaining a balanced answer accuracy and citation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Le Hai, Nghi D. Q. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Code comments provide important information for understanding the source code. They can help developers understand the overall purpose of a function or class, as well as identify bugs and technical debt. However, an overabundance of comments is meaningless and counterproductive. As a result, it is critical to automatically filter out these comments for specific purposes. In this paper, we present Dopamin, a Transformer-based tool for dealing with this issue. Our model excels not only in presenting knowledge sharing of common categories across multiple languages, but also in achieving robust performance in comment classification by improving comment representation. As a result, it outperforms the STACC baseline by 3% on the NLBSE'24 Tool Competition dataset in terms of average F1-score, while maintaining a comparable inference time for practical use.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avshalom Manevich, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) that facilitate processing both image and text inputs, expanding AI capabilities. However, LVLMs struggle with object hallucinations due to their reliance on text cues and learned object co-occurrence biases. While most research quantifies these hallucinations, mitigation strategies are still lacking. Our study introduces a Language Contrastive Decoding (LCD) algorithm that adjusts LVLM outputs based on LLM distribution confidence levels, effectively reducing object hallucinations. We demonstrate the advantages of LCD in leading LVLMs, showing up to %4 improvement in POPE F1 scores and up to %36 reduction in CHAIR scores on the COCO validation set, while also improving captioning quality scores. Our method effectively improves LVLMs without needing complex post-processing or retraining, and is easily applicable to different models. Our findings highlight the potential of further exploration of LVLM-specific decoding algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Shi, Zhimeng Liu, Yi Yang, Weize Wu, Yuyang Zhang, Hongbo Zhang, Jing Lin, Siyu Wu, Zihan Chen, Ruiming Li, Nan Wang, Zipeng Liu, Huobin Tan, Hongyi Gao, Yue Zhang, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraction of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) synthesis conditions from literature text has been challenging but crucial for the logical design of new MOFs with desirable functionality. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) provides disruptively new solution to this long-standing problem and latest researches have reported over 90% F1 in extracting correct conditions from MOFs literature. We argue in this paper that most existing synthesis extraction practices with LLMs stay with the primitive zero-shot learning, which could lead to downgraded extraction and application performance due to the lack of specialized knowledge. This work pioneers and optimizes the few-shot in-context learning paradigm for LLM extraction of material synthesis conditions. First, we propose a human-AI joint data curation process to secure high-quality ground-truth demonstrations for few-shot learning. Second, we apply a BM25 algorithm based on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique to adaptively select few-shot demonstrations for each MOF's extraction. Over a dataset randomly sampled from 84,898 well-defined MOFs, the proposed few-shot method achieves much higher average F1 performance (0.93 vs. 0.81, +14.8%) than the native zero-shot LLM using the same GPT-4 model, under fully automatic evaluation that are more objective than the previous human evaluation. The proposed method is further validated through real-world material experiments: compared with the baseline zero-shot LLM, the proposed few-shot approach increases the MOFs structural inference performance (R^2) by 29.4% in average.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs are statistical models of language learning through stochastic gradient descent with a next token prediction objective. Prompting a popular view among AI modelers: LLMs are just next token predictors. While LLMs are engineered using next token prediction, and trained based on their success at this task, our view is that a reduction to just next token predictor sells LLMs short. Moreover, there are important explanations of LLM behavior and capabilities that are lost when we engage in this kind of reduction. In order to draw this out, we will make an analogy with a once prominent research program in biology explaining evolution and development from the gene's eye view.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Atil, Alexa Chittams, Liseng Fu, Ferhan Ture, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: A concerning property of our nearly magical LLMs involves the variation of results given the exact same input and deterministic hyper-parameters. While AI has always had a certain level of noisiness from inputs outside of training data, we have generally had deterministic results for any particular input; that is no longer true. While most LLM practitioners are "in the know", we are unaware of any work that attempts to quantify current LLM stability. We suspect no one has taken the trouble because it is just too boring a paper to execute and write. But we have done it and there are some surprises.
  What kinds of surprises?
  The evaluated LLMs are rarely deterministic at the raw output level; they are much more deterministic at the parsed output/answer level but still rarely 100% stable across 5 re-runs with same data input.
  LLM accuracy variation is not normally distributed.
  Stability varies based on task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Se-eun Yoon, Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Zaid Alibadi, Surya Kallumadi, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of using first names in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly when prompted with ethical decision-making tasks. We propose an approach that appends first names to ethically annotated text scenarios to reveal demographic biases in model outputs. Our study involves a curated list of more than 300 names representing diverse genders and ethnic backgrounds, tested across thousands of moral scenarios. Following the auditing methodologies from social sciences we propose a detailed analysis involving popular LLMs/VLMs to contribute to the field of responsible AI by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and mitigating biases in these systems. Furthermore, we introduce a novel benchmark, the Pratical Scenarios Benchmark (PSB), designed to assess the presence of biases involving gender or demographic prejudices in everyday decision-making scenarios as well as practical scenarios where an LLM might be used to make sensible decisions (e.g., granting mortgages or insurances). This benchmark allows for a comprehensive comparison of model behaviors across different demographic categories, highlighting the risks and biases that may arise in practical applications of LLMs and VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyan Ma, Wei Liu, Bin Lu, Xiaoying Gan, Yunqiang Zhu, Luoyi Fu, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of data fuels data-driven research, facilitating progress across diverse domains. The FAIR principles emerge as a guiding standard, aiming to enhance the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data. However, current efforts primarily focus on manual data FAIRification, which can only handle targeted data and lack efficiency. To address this issue, we propose AutoFAIR, an architecture designed to enhance data FAIRness automately. Firstly, We align each data and metadata operation with specific FAIR indicators to guide machine-executable actions. Then, We utilize Web Reader to automatically extract metadata based on language models, even in the absence of structured data webpage schemas. Subsequently, FAIR Alignment is employed to make metadata comply with FAIR principles by ontology guidance and semantic matching. Finally, by applying AutoFAIR to various data, especially in the field of mountain hazards, we observe significant improvements in findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data. The FAIRness scores before and after applying AutoFAIR indicate enhanced data value.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering the checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, the checklist is often filled out at the last moment. In this work, we introduce ACLReady, a retrieval-augmented language model application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with the ACL checklist. To test the effectiveness of the system, we conducted a qualitative study with 13 users which shows that 92% of users found the application useful and easy to use as well as 77% of the users found that the application provided the information they expected.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophia Ho, Jinsol Park, Patrick Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CREST (Compact Retrieval-Based Speculative Decoding), a redesign of REST that allows it to be effectively "compacted". REST is a drafting technique for speculative decoding based on retrieving exact n-gram matches of the most recent n tokens generated by the target LLM from a datastore. The key idea of CREST is to only store a subset of the smallest and most common n-grams in the datastore with the hope of achieving comparable performance with less storage space. We found that storing a subset of n-grams both reduces storage space and improves performance. CREST matches REST's accepted token length with 10.6-13.5x less storage space and achieves a 16.5-17.1% higher acceptance length than REST using the same storage space on the HumanEval and MT Bench benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04679">Towards Linguistic Neural Representation Learning and Sentence Retrieval from Electroencephalogram Recordings</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzhao Zhou, Yiqun Duan, Ziyi Zhao, Yu-Cheng Chang, Yu-Kai Wang, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM integration in digital health applications. We demonstrate SpeziLLM's broad applicability across six digital health applications, showcasing its versatility in various healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samantha Chan, Pat Pataranutaporn, Aditya Suri, Wazeer Zulfikar, Pattie Maes, Elizabeth F. Loftus</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the impact of AI on human false memories -- recollections of events that did not occur or deviate from actual occurrences. It explores false memory induction through suggestive questioning in Human-AI interactions, simulating crime witness interviews. Four conditions were tested: control, survey-based, pre-scripted chatbot, and generative chatbot using a large language model (LLM). Participants (N=200) watched a crime video, then interacted with their assigned AI interviewer or survey, answering questions including five misleading ones. False memories were assessed immediately and after one week. Results show the generative chatbot condition significantly increased false memory formation, inducing over 3 times more immediate false memories than the control and 1.7 times more than the survey method. 36.4% of users' responses to the generative chatbot were misled through the interaction. After one week, the number of false memories induced by generative chatbots remained constant. However, confidence in these false memories remained higher than the control after one week. Moderating factors were explored: users who were less familiar with chatbots but more familiar with AI technology, and more interested in crime investigations, were more susceptible to false memories. These findings highlight the potential risks of using advanced AI in sensitive contexts, like police interviews, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations.</p>

We show that open source and proprietary models have a significant performance gap, and complex tasks like State Dependency, Canonicalization and Insufficient Information defined in ToolSandbox are challenging even the most capable SOTA LLMs, providing brand-new insights into tool-use LLM capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongtao Sun, Deyue Zhang, Dongdong Yang, Quanchen Zou, Hui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the performance of numerous applications, from intelligent conversations to text generation. However, their inherent security vulnerabilities have become an increasingly significant challenge, especially with respect to jailbreak attacks. Attackers can circumvent the security mechanisms of these LLMs, breaching security constraints and causing harmful outputs. Focusing on multi-turn semantic jailbreak attacks, we observe that existing methods lack specific considerations for the role of multiturn dialogues in attack strategies, leading to semantic deviations during continuous interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a theoretical foundation for multi-turn attacks by considering their support in jailbreak attacks, and based on this, propose a context-based contextual fusion black-box jailbreak attack method, named Context Fusion Attack (CFA). This method approach involves filtering and extracting key terms from the target, constructing contextual scenarios around these terms, dynamically integrating the target into the scenarios, replacing malicious key terms within the target, and thereby concealing the direct malicious intent. Through comparisons on various mainstream LLMs and red team datasets, we have demonstrated CFA's superior success rate, divergence, and harmfulness compared to other multi-turn attack strategies, particularly showcasing significant advantages on Llama3 and GPT-4.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and Text-to-SQL models. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate informative column descriptions as a semantic layer for relational databases. Using the BIRD-Bench development set, we created \textsc{ColSQL}, a dataset with gold-standard column descriptions generated and refined by LLMs and human annotators. We evaluated several instruction-tuned models, finding that GPT-4o and Command R+ excelled in generating high-quality descriptions. Additionally, we applied an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate model performance. Although this method does not align well with human evaluations, we included it to explore its potential and to identify areas for improvement. More work is needed to improve the reliability of automatic evaluations for this task. We also find that detailed column descriptions significantly improve Text-to-SQL execution accuracy, especially when columns are uninformative. This study establishes LLMs as effective tools for generating detailed metadata, enhancing the usability of relational databases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the cost-prohibitive nature of training Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning has emerged as an attractive alternative for specializing LLMs for specific tasks using limited compute resources in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we characterize sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) based LLM fine-tuning to understand their accuracy and runtime performance on a single GPU. Our evaluation provides unique insights into the training efficacy of sparse and dense versions of MoE models, as well as their runtime characteristics, including maximum batch size, execution time breakdown, end-to-end throughput, GPU hardware utilization, and load distribution. Our study identifies the optimization of the MoE layer as crucial for further improving the performance of LLM fine-tuning. Using our profiling results, we also develop and validate an analytical model to estimate the cost of LLM fine-tuning on the cloud. This model, based on parameters of the model and GPU architecture, estimates LLM throughput and the cost of training, aiding practitioners in industry and academia to budget the cost of fine-tuning a specific model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential for clinical symptom extraction, but their deployment in healthcare settings is constrained by privacy concerns, computational limitations, and operational costs. This study investigates the optimization of compact LLMs for cancer toxicity symptom extraction using a novel iterative refinement approach. We employ a student-teacher architecture, utilizing Zephyr-7b-beta and Phi3-mini-128 as student models and GPT-4o as the teacher, to dynamically select between prompt refinement, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies. Our experiments on 294 clinical notes covering 12 post-radiotherapy toxicity symptoms demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The RAG method proved most efficient, improving average accuracy scores from 0.32 to 0.73 for Zephyr-7b-beta and from 0.40 to 0.87 for Phi3-mini-128 during refinement. In the test set, both models showed an approximate 0.20 increase in accuracy across symptoms. Notably, this improvement was achieved at a cost 45 times lower than GPT-4o for Zephyr and 79 times lower for Phi-3. These results highlight the potential of iterative refinement techniques in enhancing the capabilities of compact LLMs for clinical applications, offering a balance between performance, cost-effectiveness, and privacy preservation in healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Nathaniel Williams, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of large language models has resulted in a multitude of tokenizers and embedding spaces, making knowledge transfer in prompt discovery tasks difficult. In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Jiang, Honghao Yang, Yuexian Wang, Qianru Chen, Yiming Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The mental health assessment of middle school students has always been one of the focuses in the field of education. This paper introduces a new ensemble learning network based on BERT, employing the concept of enhancing model performance by integrating multiple classifiers. We trained a range of BERT-based learners, which combined using the majority voting method. We collect social network text data of middle school students through China's Weibo and apply the method to the task of classifying emotional tendencies in middle school students' social network texts. Experimental results suggest that the ensemble learning network has a better performance than the base model and the performance of the ensemble learning model, consisting of three single-layer BERT models, is barely the same as a three-layer BERT model but requires 11.58% more training time. Therefore, in terms of balancing prediction effect and efficiency, the deeper BERT network should be preferred for training. However, for interpretability, network ensembles can provide acceptable solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Chart Question Answering (ChartQA) is challenging due to the complex distribution of chart elements with patterns of the underlying data not explicitly displayed in charts. To address this challenge, we design a joint multimodal scene graph for charts to explicitly represent the relationships between chart elements and their patterns. Our proposed multimodal scene graph includes a visual graph and a textual graph to jointly capture the structural and semantical knowledge from the chart. This graph module can be easily integrated with different vision transformers as inductive bias. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating the proposed graph module enhances the understanding of charts' elements' structure and semantics, thereby improving performance on publicly available benchmarks, ChartQA and OpenCQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenming Tang, Zhixiang Wang, Yunfang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highly depends on the quality of demonstrations. In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET score among all learning-free methods, indicating that combining syntactic and lexical coverage successfully helps to select better in-context examples for MT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanka Kargupta, Yunyi Zhang, Yizhu Jiao, Siru Ouyang, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Episodic structures are inherently interpretable and adaptable to evolving large-scale key events. However, state-of-the-art automatic event detection methods overlook event episodes and, therefore, struggle with these crucial characteristics. This paper introduces a novel task, episode detection, aimed at identifying episodes from a news corpus containing key event articles. An episode describes a cohesive cluster of core entities (e.g., "protesters", "police") performing actions at a specific time and location. Furthermore, an episode is a significant part of a larger group of episodes under a particular key event. Automatically detecting episodes is challenging because, unlike key events and atomic actions, we cannot rely on explicit mentions of times and locations to distinguish between episodes or use semantic similarity to merge inconsistent episode co-references. To address these challenges, we introduce EpiMine, an unsupervised episode detection framework that (1) automatically identifies the most salient, key-event-relevant terms and segments, (2) determines candidate episodes in an article based on natural episodic partitions estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations, and (3) refines and forms final episode clusters using large language model-based reasoning on the candidate episodes. We construct three diverse, real-world event datasets annotated at the episode level. EpiMine outperforms all baselines on these datasets by an average 59.2% increase across all metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Zhang, Wuxia Bai, Yuxi Li, Mark Huasong Meng, Kailong Wang, Ling Shi, Li Li, Jun Wang, Haoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field of natural language processing. However, the black-box nature of their internal mechanisms has brought many concerns about their trustworthiness and interpretability. Recent research has discovered a class of abnormal tokens in the model's vocabulary space and named them "glitch tokens". Those tokens, once included in the input, may induce the model to produce incorrect, irrelevant, or even harmful results, drastically undermining the reliability and practicality of LLMs.
  In this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of glitch tokens and propose techniques for their detection and mitigation. We first reveal the characteristic features induced by glitch tokens on LLMs, which are evidenced by significant deviations in the distributions of attention patterns and dynamic information from intermediate model layers. Based on the insights, we develop GlitchProber, a tool for efficient glitch token detection and mitigation. GlitchProber utilizes small-scale sampling, principal component analysis for accelerated feature extraction, and a simple classifier for efficient vocabulary screening. Taking one step further, GlitchProber rectifies abnormal model intermediate layer values to mitigate the destructive effects of glitch tokens. Evaluated on five mainstream open-source LLMs, GlitchProber demonstrates higher efficiency, precision, and recall compared to existing approaches, with an average F1 score of 0.86 and an average repair rate of 50.06%. GlitchProber unveils a novel path to address the challenges posed by glitch tokens and inspires future research toward more robust and interpretable LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04906">Towards a Generative Approach for Emotion Detection and Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankita Bhaumik, Tomek Strzalkowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. But can they perform emotional reasoning by concatenating `Let's think step-by-step' to the input prompt? In this paper we investigate this question along with introducing a novel approach to zero-shot emotion detection and emotional reasoning using LLMs. Existing state of the art zero-shot approaches rely on textual entailment models to choose the most appropriate emotion label for an input text. We argue that this strongly restricts the model to a fixed set of labels which may not be suitable or sufficient for many applications where emotion analysis is required. Instead, we propose framing the problem of emotion analysis as a generative question-answering (QA) task. Our approach uses a two step methodology of generating relevant context or background knowledge to answer the emotion detection question step-by-step. Our paper is the first work on using a generative approach to jointly address the tasks of emotion detection and emotional reasoning for texts. We evaluate our approach on two popular emotion detection datasets and also release the fine-grained emotion labels and explanations for further training and fine-tuning of emotional reasoning systems.</p>

Instead, we propose EnsembEval -- an ensemble of evaluation methods achieving the highest reported correlation with human judgements across 5 image captioning datasets, showing there is a lot of room for improvement by leveraging a diverse set of metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Liberatore, Kyriaki Kalimeri, Derya Sever, Yelena Mejova</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanitarian action is accompanied by a mass of reports, summaries, news, and other documents. To guide its activities, important information must be quickly extracted from such free-text resources. Quantities, such as the number of people affected, amount of aid distributed, or the extent of infrastructure damage, are central to emergency response and anticipatory action. In this work, we contribute an annotated dataset for the humanitarian domain for the extraction of such quantitative information, along side its important context, including units it refers to, any modifiers, and the relevant event. Further, we develop a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract the quantities alongside their units, and evaluate it in comparison to baseline and recent literature. The proposed model achieves a consistent improvement in the performance, especially in the documents pertaining to the Dominican Republic and select African countries. We make the dataset and code available to the research community to continue the improvement of NLP tools for the humanitarian domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhaskarjit Sarmah, Benika Hall, Rohan Rao, Sunil Patel, Stefano Pasquali, Dhagash Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Verna Dankers, Ivan Titov</p>
<p>Abstract: Memorisation is a natural part of learning from real-world data: neural models pick up on atypical input-output combinations and store those training examples in their parameter space. That this happens is well-known, but how and where are questions that remain largely unanswered. Given a multi-layered neural model, where does memorisation occur in the millions of parameters? Related work reports conflicting findings: a dominant hypothesis based on image classification is that lower layers learn generalisable features and that deeper layers specialise and memorise. Work from NLP suggests this does not apply to language models, but has been mainly focused on memorisation of facts. We expand the scope of the localisation question to 12 natural language classification tasks and apply 4 memorisation localisation techniques. Our results indicate that memorisation is a gradual process rather than a localised one, establish that memorisation is task-dependent, and give nuance to the generalisation first, memorisation second hypothesis.</p>

In addition, our \textit{re}CSE has achieved competitive performance in semantic similarity tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohan Zhang, Ziquan Liu, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to memorize and recite some of the textual sequences from their training set verbatim, raising broad concerns about privacy and copyright issues when using LLMs. This Textual Sequence Memorization (TSM) phenomenon leads to a high demand to regulate LLM output to prevent it from generating certain memorized text to meet user requirements. However, our empirical study reveals that existing methods for TSM erasure fail to forget massive memorized samples without substantially jeopardizing the model utility. To achieve a better trade-off between the effectiveness of TSM erasure and model utility in LLMs, our paper proposes a new framework based on Entropy Maximization with Selective Optimization (EMSO), where the updated weights are chosen with a novel contrastive gradient metric without any participation of additional model or data. Our analysis shows that training with the entropy maximization loss has a more stable optimization process and better keeps model utility than existing methods. The contrastive gradient metric localizes the most influential weight for TSM erasure by taking both the gradient magnitude and direction into consideration. Extensive experiments across three model scales demonstrate that our method excels in handling large-scale forgetting requests while preserving model ability in language generation and reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: While fusing the capacities and advantages of various large language models (LLMs) offers a pathway to construct more powerful and versatile models, a fundamental challenge is to properly select advantageous model during the training. Existing fusion methods primarily focus on the training mode that uses cross entropy on ground truth in a teacher-forcing setup to measure a model's advantage, which may provide limited insight towards model advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances the fusion process by incorporating both the training and inference modes. Our method evaluates model advantage not only through cross entropy during training but also by considering inference outputs, providing a more comprehensive assessment. To combine the two modes effectively, we introduce ProFuser to progressively transition from inference mode to training mode. To validate ProFuser's effectiveness, we fused three models, including vicuna-7b-v1.5, Llama-2-7b-chat, and mpt-7b-8k-chat, and demonstrated the improved performance in knowledge, reasoning, and safety compared to baseline methods.</p>

This approach has been shown to suffer from spurious correlations and the lack of challenging examples that represent the diversity of natural language. Instead, we examine a framework for evaluating optimised models in training-set free setting on synthetically generated challenge sets. We find that despite the simplicity of the generation method, the data can compete with crowd-sourced datasets with regard to naturalness and lexical diversity for the purpose of evaluating the linguistic capabilities of MRC models. We conduct further experiments and show that state-of-the-art language model-based MRC systems can learn to succeed on the challenge set correctly, although, without capturing the general notion of the evaluated phenomenon.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Exame Nacional do Ensino M\'edio (ENEM) is a pivotal test for Brazilian students, required for admission to a significant number of universities in Brazil. The test consists of four objective high-school level tests on Math, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Languages, and one writing essay. Students' answers to the test and to the accompanying socioeconomic status questionnaire are made public every year (albeit anonymized) due to transparency policies from the Brazilian Government. In the context of large language models (LLMs), these data lend themselves nicely to comparing different groups of humans with AI, as we can have access to human and machine answer distributions. We leverage these characteristics of the ENEM dataset and compare GPT-3.5 and 4, and MariTalk, a model trained using Portuguese data, to humans, aiming to ascertain how their answers relate to real societal groups and what that may reveal about the model biases. We divide the human groups by using socioeconomic status (SES), and compare their answer distribution with LLMs for each question and for the essay. We find no significant biases when comparing LLM performance to humans on the multiple-choice Brazilian Portuguese tests, as the distance between model and human answers is mostly determined by the human accuracy. A similar conclusion is found by looking at the generated text as, when analyzing the essays, we observe that human and LLM essays differ in a few key factors, one being the choice of words where model essays were easily separable from human ones. The texts also differ syntactically, with LLM generated essays exhibiting, on average, smaller sentences and less thought units, among other differences. These results suggest that, for Brazilian Portuguese in the ENEM context, LLM outputs represent no group of humans, being significantly different from the answers from Brazilian students across all tests.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05086">Generating novel experimental hypotheses from language models: A case study on cross-dative generalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishka Misra, Najoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me) -- acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features -- using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: "what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?" To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs' usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context -- in particular, its first postverbal argument -- are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikai Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingchen Fu, Yupeng Hou, Julian McAuley, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of multi-objective alignment aims at balancing and controlling the different alignment objectives (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty) of large language models to meet the personalized requirements of different users. However, previous methods tend to train multiple models to deal with various user preferences, with the number of trained models growing linearly with the number of alignment objectives and the number of different preferences. Meanwhile, existing methods are generally poor in extensibility and require significant re-training for each new alignment objective considered. Considering the limitation of previous approaches, we propose MCA (Multi-objective Contrastive Alignemnt), which constructs an expert prompt and an adversarial prompt for each objective to contrast at the decoding time and balances the objectives through combining the contrast. Our approach is verified to be superior to previous methods in obtaining a well-distributed Pareto front among different alignment objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present MooER, a LLM-based large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) / automatic speech translation (AST) model of Moore Threads. A 5000h pseudo labeled dataset containing open source and self collected speech data is used for training. We achieve performance comparable to other open source models trained with up to hundreds of thousands of hours of labeled speech data. Meanwhile, experiments conducted on Covost2 Zh2en testset suggest that our model outperforms other open source Speech LLMs. A BLEU score of 25.2 can be obtained. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, this paper presents a training strategy for encoders and LLMs on speech related tasks (including ASR and AST) using a small size of pseudo labeled data without any extra manual annotation and selection. Second, we release our ASR and AST models and plan to open-source our training code and strategy in the near future. Moreover, a model trained on 8wh scale training data is planned to be released later on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Li, Junli Wang, Junjie Hu, Ming Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Much work on the cultural awareness of large language models (LLMs) focuses on the models' sensitivity to geo-cultural diversity. However, in addition to cross-cultural differences, there also exists common ground across cultures. For instance, a bridal veil in the United States plays a similar cultural-relevant role as a honggaitou in China. In this study, we introduce a benchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding the cultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluation examples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10 countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevant features per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair of cross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastive matching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associated cross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popular prompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted concept features or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that cultural associations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ from food. Our analysis shows that LLMs are still limited to capturing cross-cultural associations between concepts compared to humans. Moreover, geo-cultural proximity shows a weak influence on model performance in capturing cross-cultural associations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Yuan, Chengwu Liu, Jingyang Yuan, Gongbo Sun, Siqi Li, Ming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to enhance their accuracy and reduce hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid RAG system enhanced through a comprehensive suite of optimizations that significantly improve retrieval quality, augment reasoning capabilities, and refine numerical computation ability. We refined the text chunks and tables in web pages, added attribute predictors to reduce hallucinations, conducted LLM Knowledge Extractor and Knowledge Graph Extractor, and finally built a reasoning strategy with all the references. We evaluated our system on the CRAG dataset through the Meta CRAG KDD Cup 2024 Competition. Both the local and online evaluations demonstrate that our system significantly enhances complex reasoning capabilities. In local evaluations, we have significantly improved accuracy and reduced error rates compared to the baseline model, achieving a notable increase in scores. In the meanwhile, we have attained outstanding results in online assessments, demonstrating the performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed system.

The goal of this subtask is to distribute a given set of usages of a polysemous word from a newer time period between senses of this word from an older time period and clusters representing gained senses of this word. We propose and experiment with three new methods solving this task. Our methods achieve SOTA results according to both official metrics of the first substask. Additionally, we develop a model that can tell if a given word usage is not described by any of the provided sense definitions. This model serves as a component in one of our methods, but can potentially be useful on its own.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Fincke, Elizabeth Boschee</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of deciding whether two documents are written by the same author is challenging for both machines and humans. This task is even more challenging when the two documents are written about different topics (e.g. baseball vs. politics) or in different genres (e.g. a blog post vs. an academic article). For machines, the problem is complicated by the relative lack of real-world training examples that cross the topic boundary and the vanishing scarcity of cross-genre data. We propose targeted methods for training data selection and a novel learning curriculum that are designed to discourage a model's reliance on topic information for authorship attribution and correspondingly force it to incorporate information more robustly indicative of style no matter the topic. These refinements yield a 62.7% relative improvement in average cross-genre authorship attribution, as well as 16.6% in the per-genre condition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model continual learning (CL) has recently garnered significant interest due to its potential to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world environments without re-training. A key challenge in this field is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks. Existing methods commonly employ multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge for each task, but these approaches lack efficiency and overlook the potential for knowledge transfer through task interaction. In this paper, we present a novel CL framework for language models called Task Skill Localization and Consolidation (TaSL), which enhances knowledge transfer without relying on memory replay. TaSL first divides the model into `skill units' based on parameter dependencies, enabling more granular control. It then employs a novel group-wise skill localization technique to identify the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves a superior balance between retaining previous knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also shows strong generalizability, suitable for general models and customizable for PEFT methods like LoRA. Additionally, it demonstrates notable extensibility, allowing integration with memory replay to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks, with varying model sizes (from 220M to 7B), demonstrate the effectiveness of TaSL and its variants across different settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elyas Rashno, Amir Eskandari, Aman Anand, Farhana Zulkernine</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have made significant strides across various artificial intelligence domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. This success has naturally garnered considerable interest from both academic and industry researchers. Consequently, numerous Transformer variants (often referred to as X-formers) have been developed for these fields. However, a thorough and systematic review of these modality-specific conversions remains lacking. Modality Conversion involves the transformation of data from one form of representation to another, mimicking the way humans integrate and interpret sensory information. This paper provides a comprehensive review of transformer-based models applied to the primary modalities of text, vision, and speech, discussing their architectures, conversion methodologies, and applications. By synthesizing the literature on modality conversion, this survey aims to underline the versatility and scalability of transformers in advancing AI-driven content generation and understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Drew Edwards, Xavier Riley, Pedro Sarmento, Simon Dixon</p>
<p>Abstract: Guitar tablatures enrich the structure of traditional music notation by assigning each note to a string and fret of a guitar in a particular tuning, indicating precisely where to play the note on the instrument. The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for most pitches, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming to minimize some cost function (e.g.\ hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings. The model is first pre-trained on DadaGP, a dataset of over 25K tablatures, and then fine-tuned on a curated set of professionally transcribed guitar performances. Given the subjective nature of assessing tablature quality, we conduct a user study amongst guitarists, wherein we ask participants to rate the playability of multiple versions of tablature for the same four-bar excerpt. The results indicate our system significantly outperforms competing algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an unsupervised method for learning a sparse decomposition of a neural network's latent representations into seemingly interpretable features. Despite recent excitement about their potential, research applications outside of industry are limited by the high cost of training a comprehensive suite of SAEs. In this work, we introduce Gemma Scope, an open suite of JumpReLU SAEs trained on all layers and sub-layers of Gemma 2 2B and 9B and select layers of Gemma 2 27B base models. We primarily train SAEs on the Gemma 2 pre-trained models, but additionally release SAEs trained on instruction-tuned Gemma 2 9B for comparison. We evaluate the quality of each SAE on standard metrics and release these results. We hope that by releasing these SAE weights, we can help make more ambitious safety and interpretability research easier for the community.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Vaccaro Jr, Mikayla Friday, Arash Zaghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-series, have made significant advancements in recent years. Known for their expertise across diverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs hold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this potential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This paper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts for middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student learning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the experimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the student's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts were rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10 level) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p = .059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor educational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant advancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical considerations for using artificial intelligence in education are also discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt in MLLM. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains. However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.</p>

State-of-the-art neural models, adapted from the inflection task, are able to learn a range of derivation patterns, and outperform a non-neural baseline by 16.4%. However, due to semantic, historical, and lexical considerations involved in derivational morphology, future work will be needed to achieve performance parity with inflection-generating systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khyati Khandelwal, Manuel Tonneau, Andrew M. Bean, Hannah Rose Kirk, Scott A. Hale</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now used daily by millions, can encode societal biases, exposing their users to representational harms. A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame through Indian-BhED, a first of its kind dataset, containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples in the context of caste and religious stereotypes in India. We find that the majority of LLMs tested have a strong propensity to output stereotypes in the Indian context, especially when compared to axes of bias traditionally studied in the Western context, such as gender and race. Notably, we find that GPT-2, GPT-2 Large, and GPT 3.5 have a particularly high propensity for preferring stereotypical outputs as a percent of all sentences for the axes of caste (63-79%) and religion (69-72%). We finally investigate potential causes for such harmful behaviour in LLMs, and posit intervention techniques to reduce both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases. The findings of this work highlight the need for including more diverse voices when researching fairness in AI and evaluating LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving exam-like math word problems. However, the degree to which these numerical reasoning skills are effective in real-world scenarios, particularly in expert domains, is still largely unexplored. This paper introduces DocMath-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing specialized documents containing both text and tables. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 48 LLMs with Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting methods, aiming to comprehensively assess the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in DocMath-Eval. We found that even the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) still significantly lags behind human experts in solving complex numerical reasoning problems grounded in long contexts. We believe that DocMath-Eval can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in solving challenging numerical reasoning problems within expert domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai Loong Aw, Syrielle Montariol, Badr AlKhamissi, Martin Schrimpf, Antoine Bosselut</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuning is a widely adopted finetuning method that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate output that more closely resembles human responses. However, no studies have shown that instruction-tuning actually teaches LLMs to process language in a similar manner as humans. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on aligning LLM and human language processing mechanisms in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs on three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences, and find that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment (~6%), but has no similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify factors underlying this improvement in brain alignment, we compute correlations between brain alignment and various LLM properties, such as model size, problem-solving, and world knowledge understanding. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that the mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Ma, Senlin Luo, Yu-Ming Shang, Yifei Zhang, Zhengjun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have investigated the potential of leveraging pre-trained language models, such as CodeBERT, to enhance source code-related tasks. Previous methodologies have relied on CodeBERT's '[CLS]' token as the embedding representation of input sequences for task performance, necessitating additional neural network layers to enhance feature representation, which in turn increases computational expenses. These approaches have also failed to fully leverage the comprehensive knowledge inherent within the source code and its associated text, potentially limiting classification efficacy. We propose CodeClassPrompt, a text classification technique that harnesses prompt learning to extract rich knowledge associated with input sequences from pre-trained models, thereby eliminating the need for additional layers and lowering computational costs. By applying an attention mechanism, we synthesize multi-layered knowledge into task-specific features, enhancing classification accuracy. Our comprehensive experimentation across four distinct source code-related tasks reveals that CodeClassPrompt achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad ElNokrashy, Badr AlKhamissi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diacritization plays a pivotal role in improving readability and disambiguating the meaning of Arabic texts. Efforts have so far focused on marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Comparatively overlooked, Partial Diacritzation (PD) is the selection of a subset of characters to be marked to aid comprehension where needed. Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers -- reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD) -- a novel approach to PD which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality, essential for establishing this as a machine learning task. Lastly, we introduce TD2, a Transformer-variant of an established model which offers a markedly different performance profile on our proposed indicators compared to all other known systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, Dan Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as "is aspartame linked to cancer". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider "which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing?". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanise Ceron, Neele Falk, Ana Bari\'c, Dmitry Nikolaev, Sebastian Pad\'o</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), we need to understand whether they embed a specific "worldview" and what these views reflect. Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings (Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024). However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs' stances on political statements based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and annotated for policy issues. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs: They show a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare state and liberal society but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences in the areas of foreign policy and migration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Petukhova, Jo\~ao P. Matos-Carvalho, Nuno Fachada</p>
<p>Abstract: Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better results in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets. Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from LLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouya Pezeshkpour, Estevam Hruschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to rank a set of items has become a common approach in recommendation and retrieval systems. Typically, these systems focus on ordering a substantial number of documents in a monotonic order based on a given query. However, real-world scenarios often present a different challenge: ranking a comparatively smaller set of items, but according to a variety of diverse and occasionally conflicting conditions. In this paper, we define and explore the task of multi-conditional ranking by introducing MCRank, a benchmark tailored for assessing multi-conditional ranking across various item types and conditions. Our analysis of LLMs using MCRank indicates a significant decrease in performance as the number and complexity of items and conditions grow. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel decomposed reasoning method, consisting of EXtracting and Sorting the conditions, and then Iteratively Ranking the items (EXSIR). Our extensive experiments show that this decomposed reasoning method enhances LLMs' performance significantly, achieving up to a 12% improvement over existing LLMs. We also provide a detailed analysis of LLMs performance across various condition categories, and examine the effectiveness of decomposition step. Furthermore, we compare our method with existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought and existing ranking models, demonstrating the superiority of our approach and complexity of MCR task. We released our dataset and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aida Mostafazadeh Davani, Sagar Gubbi, Sunipa Dev, Shachi Dave, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative language models are transforming our digital ecosystem, but they often inherit societal biases, for instance stereotypes associating certain attributes with specific identity groups. While whether and how these biases are mitigated may depend on the specific use cases, being able to effectively detect instances of stereotype perpetuation is a crucial first step. Current methods to assess presence of stereotypes in generated language rely on simple template or co-occurrence based measures, without accounting for the variety of sentential contexts they manifest in. We argue that understanding the sentential context is crucial for detecting instances of generalization. We distinguish two types of generalizations: (1) language that merely mentions the presence of a generalization ("people think the French are very rude"), and (2) language that reinforces such a generalization ("as French they must be rude"), from non-generalizing context ("My French friends think I am rude"). For meaningful stereotype evaluations, we need to reliably distinguish such instances of generalizations. We introduce the new task of detecting generalization in language, and build GeniL, a multilingual dataset of over 50K sentences from 9 languages (English, Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Malay, and Portuguese) annotated for instances of generalizations. We demonstrate that the likelihood of a co-occurrence being an instance of generalization is usually low, and varies across different languages, identity groups, and attributes. We build classifiers to detect generalization in language with an overall PR-AUC of 58.7, with varying degrees of performance across languages. Our research provides data and tools to enable a nuanced understanding of stereotype perpetuation, a crucial step towards more inclusive and responsible language technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the utilization of large language models (LLMs) has proliferated world-wide, it is crucial for them to have adequate knowledge and fair representation for diverse global cultures. In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found here: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonsang Lee, Xi Ye, Eunsol Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Different entities with the same name can be difficult to distinguish. Handling confusing entity mentions is a crucial skill for language models (LMs). For example, given the question "Where was Michael Jordan educated?" and a set of documents discussing different people named Michael Jordan, can LMs distinguish entity mentions to generate a cohesive answer to the question? To test this ability, we introduce a new benchmark, AmbigDocs. By leveraging Wikipedia's disambiguation pages, we identify a set of documents, belonging to different entities who share an ambiguous name. From these documents, we generate questions containing an ambiguous name and their corresponding sets of answers. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art models often yield ambiguous answers or incorrectly merge information belonging to different entities. We establish an ontology categorizing four types of incomplete answers and automatic evaluation metrics to identify such categories. We lay the foundation for future work on reasoning across multiple documents with ambiguous entities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolo Micheletti, Samuel Belkadi, Lifeng Han, Goran Nenadic</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in practically every task in this field. However, the prevalent approach used in text generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates text sequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model, which does not decide when and where each token is generated. In contrast, Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understanding tasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order. This paper conducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generation tasks. To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes on three different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plot synopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets. To assess the quality of the generations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform a qualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness. In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them in three different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) Text Classification, and 3) Authorship Verification. The results show that MLM consistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, with higher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text. The study also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of the generated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks. With this study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for future research and provides direction for future studies in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zhang, Peter Jansen, Tianyi Zhang, Peter Clark, Chris Callison-Burch, Niket Tandon</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning in textual environments have been shown to be a long-standing challenge even for current models. A recent, promising line of work uses LLMs to generate a formal representation of the environment that can be solved by a symbolic planner. However, existing methods rely on a fully-observed environment where all entity states are initially known, so a one-off representation can be constructed, leading to a complete plan. In contrast, we tackle partially-observed environments where there is initially no sufficient information to plan for the end-goal. We propose PDDLEGO that iteratively construct a planning representation that can lead to a partial plan for a given sub-goal. By accomplishing the sub-goal, more information is acquired to augment the representation, eventually achieving the end-goal. We show that plans produced by few-shot PDDLEGO are 43% more efficient than generating plans end-to-end on the Coin Collector simulation, with strong performance (98%) on the more complex Cooking World simulation where end-to-end LLMs fail to generate coherent plans (4%).</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Feng, Yan Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Zijie Meng, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable advancements in machine translation (MT) by leveraging extensive web content. On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, MT-Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and MT-Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of MT-Ladder in diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/Ladder</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Luis Gastaldi, John Terilla, Luca Malagutti, Brian DuSell, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we report our efforts to advance the standard operation procedure of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) or LLMs-based systems or services in industry. We introduce the concept of Large Language Model Development Lifecycle (LDLC) and then highlight the importance of consistency test in ensuring the delivery quality. The principled solution of consistency test, however, is usually overlooked by industrial practitioners and not urgent in academia, and current practical solutions are insufficiently rigours and labor-intensive. We thus propose a simple yet effective consistency test protocol, named SimCT. SimCT is mainly to proactively check the consistency across different development stages of "bare metal" LLMs or associated services without accessing the model artifacts, in an attempt to expedite the delivery by reducing the back-and-forth alignment communications among multiple teams involved in different development stages.
  Specifically, SimCT encompasses response-wise and model-wise tests. We implement the protocol with LightGBM and Student's t-test for two components respectively, and perform extensive experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of SimCT and the involved components.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are able to generate code for visualisations in response to user requests. This is a useful application, and an appealing one for NLP research because plots of data provide grounding for language. However, there are relatively few benchmarks, and it is unknown whether those that exist are representative of what people do in practice. This paper aims to answer that question through an empirical study comparing benchmark datasets and code from public repositories. Our findings reveal a substantial gap in datasets, with evaluations not testing the same distribution of chart types, attributes, and the number of actions. The only representative dataset requires modification to become an end-to-end and practical benchmark. This shows that new, more benchmarks are needed to support the development of systems that truly address users' visualisation needs. These observations will guide future data creation, highlighting which features hold genuine significance for users.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of how large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, interpret constitutional principles in complex decision-making scenarios. We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional Court on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and compare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by the State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4 consistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the Constitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants' views rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the Court's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4 to favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of underlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment in real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in decision-making processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Valentin, Jinmiao Fu, Gianluca Detommaso, Shaoyuan Xu, Giovanni Zappella, Bryan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nakyeong Yang, Minsung Kim, Seunghyun Yoon, Joongbo Shin, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosion of multimedia content, video moment retrieval (VMR), which aims to detect a video moment that matches a given text query from a video, has been studied intensively as a critical problem. However, the existing VMR framework evaluates video moment retrieval performance, assuming that a video is given, which may not reveal whether the models exhibit overconfidence in the falsely given video. In this paper, we propose the MVMR (Massive Videos Moment Retrieval for Faithfulness Evaluation) task that aims to retrieve video moments within a massive video set, including multiple distractors, to evaluate the faithfulness of VMR models. For this task, we suggest an automated massive video pool construction framework to categorize negative (distractors) and positive (false-negative) video sets using textual and visual semantic distance verification methods. We extend existing VMR datasets using these methods and newly construct three practical MVMR datasets. To solve the task, we further propose a strong informative sample-weighted learning method, CroCs, which employs two contrastive learning mechanisms: (1) weakly-supervised potential negative learning and (2) cross-directional hard-negative learning. Experimental results on the MVMR datasets reveal that existing VMR models are easily distracted by the misinformation (distractors), whereas our model shows significantly robust performance, demonstrating that CroCs is essential to distinguishing positive moments against distractors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Mallen, Madeline Brumley, Julia Kharchenko, Nora Belrose</p>
<p>Abstract: Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) aims to find patterns in a capable neural network's activations that robustly track the true state of the world, especially in hard-to-verify cases where the model's output is untrusted. To further ELK research, we introduce 12 datasets and a corresponding suite of "quirky" language models (LMs) that are finetuned to make systematic errors when answering questions if and only if the keyword "Bob" is present in the prompt. We find that, especially in middle layers, linear probes usually report an LM's knowledge independently of what the LM outputs, enabling us to elicit the correct answer despite the model's untruthful output. The best probing method (logistic regression on contrast pairs) recovers 89% of the gap in AUROC between truthful and untruthful contexts, and 75% for questions harder than those used to train the probe. We also find that a mechanistic anomaly detection approach can flag untruthful behavior with 0.95 AUROC. Our results show promise for eliciting reliable knowledge from capable but untrusted models, and facilitates future research empirically investigating ELK methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haz Sameen Shahgir, Khondker Salman Sayeed, Abhik Bhattacharjee, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Yue Dong, Rifat Shahriyar</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Vision Language Models (VLM) has allowed researchers to investigate the visual understanding of a neural network using natural language. Beyond object classification and detection, VLMs are capable of visual comprehension and common-sense reasoning. This naturally led to the question: How do VLMs respond when the image itself is inherently unreasonable? To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization. GPT4V, the best performing VLM, achieves 62.99% accuracy (4-shot) on the comprehension task and 49.7% on the localization task (4-shot and Chain-of-Thought). Human evaluation reveals that humans achieve 91.03% and 100% accuracy in comprehension and localization. We discover that In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning substantially degrade the performance of Gemini-Pro in the localization task. Tangentially, we discover a potential weakness in the ICL capabilities of VLMs: they fail to locate optical illusions even when the correct answer is in the context window as a few-shot example.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Hu, Linxin Song, Jieyu Zhang, Zheyuan Xiao, Jingang Wang, Zhenyu Chen, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of large language model (LLM)-based preference evaluations has become widespread for comparing model responses, but it has revealed a notable bias towards longer responses, questioning the reliability of such evaluations. This paper explores the length bias in LLM evaluations from a data-centric perspective, analyzing 14 commonly used preference datasets and 10 reward models. Our findings indicate that human preference labeling favors longer responses and this spurious correlation is learned by the reward model and subsequently propagated to the aligned model during training. We decompose the preference evaluation metric, i.e., win rate, from the perspective of human to identify the deeper factors and conclude that the win rate is affected by two axes of model response: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness, and the latter is length-dependent and can be represented by conditional entropy. Controlled experiments demonstrate that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To ensure reliable evaluation metrics that assess content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, by adjusting the lengths of reference answers to match the test model's answers within the same interval, we debias information mass relative to length, ensuring a fair model evaluation. Furthermore, we investigate length bias in DPO using AlpacaEval and AdapAlpaca. By testing Tulu2 and Tulu2-dpo at 7B, 13B, and 70B scales, we found that DPO leads to higher human preference, but this gain is amplified by response length, with AlpacaEval showing higher win rates gain than AdapAlpaca.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years has witnessed an increase in technologies that use speech for the sensing of the health of the talker. This survey paper proposes a general taxonomy of the technologies and a broad overview of current progress and challenges. Vocal biomarkers are often secondary measures that are approximating a signal of another sensor or identifying an underlying mental, cognitive, or physiological state. Their measurement involve disturbances and uncertainties that may be considered as noise sources and the biomarkers are coarsely qualified in terms of the various sources of noise involved in their determination. While in some proposed biomarkers the error levels seem high, there are vocal biomarkers where the errors are expected to be low and thus are more likely to qualify as candidates for adoption in healthcare applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasudev Shyam, Jonathan Pilault, Emily Shepperd, Quentin Anthony, Beren Millidge</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention is the core mathematical operation of modern transformer architectures and is also a significant computational bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity in the sequence length. In this work, we derive the scalar energy function whose gradient computes the self-attention block, thus elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of self-attention, providing a Bayesian interpretation of the operation and linking it closely with energy-based models such as Hopfield Networks. Our formulation reveals that the reduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel through a tree reduction. Our algorithm, for parallelizing attention computation across multiple GPUs enables cross-device decoding to be performed asymptotically faster (up to 8x faster in our experiments) than alternative approaches such as Ring Attention, while also requiring significantly less communication volume and incurring 2x less peak memory.
