<p><b>Authors:</b> Atli Sigurgeirsson, Simon King</p>
<p>Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete features that improve overall controllability of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> K. Sahit Reddy, N. Ragavenderan, Vasanth K., Ganesh N. Naik, Vishalakshi Prabhu, Nagaraja G. S</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5, despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing domain-specific information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aldan Creo, Raul Castro Fernandez, Manuel Cebrian</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity, compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased, indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm before defensive adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prudence Djagba, Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model, across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering, Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps, particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks, it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017">Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Beckmann, Matthieu Queloz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon, arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Mounier, Parsa Idehpour</p>
<p>Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask, Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Varshney, Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts. Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini) across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context) with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their deployment in automated hiring systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Zhang, Yuxi Li, Kailong Wang, Shuai Yuan, Ling Shi, Haoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations. ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence, without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for embedding-aware defenses.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08021">Unveiling Effective In-Context Configurations for Image Captioning: An External &amp; Internal Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Li, Yongliang Wu, Jingze Zhu, Jiawei Peng, Jianfei Cai, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment. We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be applied to broader research areas.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027">&quot;Amazing, They All Lean Left&quot; -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> W. Russell Neuman, Chad Coleman, Ali Dasdan, Safinah Ali, Manan Shah, Kund Meghani</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical and political responses generated by most commercial large language models (LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear. This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity (Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness, across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally, we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ada Aka, Emil Palikot, Ali Ansari, Nima Yazdani</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of 20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE 2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials. We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while highlighting some of their potential implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonali Sharma, Ahmed M. Alaa, Roxana Daneshjou</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms, 500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023 to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative, disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context of each output.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08031">Beyond Scale: Small Language Models are Comparable to GPT-4 in Mental Health Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Jia, Shiya Fu, Vassilis Kostakos, Feng Xia, Ting Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks. Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nripesh Niketan, Hadj Batatia</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o, LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepali Mishra, Chaklam Silpasuwanchai, Ashutosh Modi, Madhumita Sushil, Sorayouth Chumnanvej</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68 publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1) reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.</p>

A promising alternative is explicit high-level plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training. In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically, using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the generalizability of learned planning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Talor Abramovich, Gal Chechik</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks: AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances. For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Walter, Hannah Bast</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes) and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting. On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of few-shot examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reilly Raab, Mike Parker, Dan Nally, Sadie Montgomery, Anastasia Bernat, Sai Munikoti, Sameera Horawalavithana</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias. How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner -- minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e., callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows (e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review. We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental impact statements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Chari, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache, which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked (query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry J. Xie, Jinghan Zhang, Xinhao Zhang, Kunpeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs. Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs. Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods, TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g., black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type (self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation, calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atticus Wang, Joshua Engels, Oliver Clive-Griffin</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to their safe and reliable deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Ekaterina Kochmar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model- and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable proxies based on our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ancita Maria Andrade, Tanvi Banerjee, Ramakrishna Mundugar</p>
<p>Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication affects individuals differently based on gender.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks, where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity. Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupu Liang, Yaping Zhang, Zhiyang Zhang, Zhiyuan Chen, Yang Zhao, Lu Xiang, Chengqing Zong, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail, merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs) that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second, retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Xu, Zhiqi Huang, Shengyao Zhuang, Ashim Gupta, Vivek Srikumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more reliable alternative otherwise.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itai Mondshine, Tzuf Paz-Argaman, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks. Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages, n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents, and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is available at https://github.com/g6000/MultiAgent-Research-Ideator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Newman, Abhilasha Ravichander, Jaehun Jung, Rui Xin, Hamish Ivison, Yegor Kuznetsov, Pang Wei Koh, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models' own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Xiang, Yang Zhao, Yaping Zhang, Chengqing Zong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the application of LLMs in interdisciplinary studies, categorising research efforts from both a technical perspective and with regard to their applicability. From a technical standpoint, key methodologies such as supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, agent-based approaches, and tool-use integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the context of interdisciplinary studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilu Dong, Xiangqing Shen, Zinong Yang, Rui Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selina Heller, Mohamed Ibrahim, David Antony Selby, Sebastian Vollmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work, we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops across various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishan Xu, Shuyi Xie, Qingsong Lv, Shupei Xiao, Linlin Song, Sui Wenjuan, Fan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score, misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marina Luketina, Andrea Benkel, Christoph G. Schuetz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured background information.</p>

<p>Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM), achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2 (Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility and strong application potential of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Alexandre Rosa, Hil\'ario Oliveira, Luiz Rodrigues, Eduardo Araujo Oliveira, Rafael Ferreira Mello</p>
<p>Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability, difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235 essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted 325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Schlangen, Sherzod Hakimov, Jonathan Jordan, Philipp Sadler</p>
<p>Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models (LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibo Sun, Xue Li, Donglin Di, Mingjie Wei, Lanshun Nie, Wei-Nan Zhang, Dechen Zhan, Yang Song, Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengze Hong, Chen Jason Zhang, Di Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86% in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the superior text mining alternative.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components: document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28 languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.</p>

Our benchmark aggregates diverse tasks including translation, question answering, math, and reasoning, using datasets such as FLORES+, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and ARC. We provide an open-source, auto-updating leaderboard and dashboard that supports researchers, developers, and policymakers in identifying strengths and gaps in model performance. In addition to ranking models, the platform offers descriptive insights such as a global proficiency map and trends over time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Pietro\'n, Rafa{\l} Olszowski, Jakub Gomu{\l}ka, Filip Gampel, Andrzej Tomski</p>
<p>Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristina Aggazzotti, Matthew Wiesner, Elizabeth Allyn Smith, Nicholas Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g. deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker identity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs), a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic. Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3 (81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Zhai, Guilin Qi, Yuan Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism. By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable knowledge fusion performance of KGA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Galarnyk, Veer Kejriwal, Agam Shah, Yash Bhardwaj, Nicholas Meyer, Anand Krishnan, Sudheer Chava</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as "finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube. Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone, delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund. An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech, sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3 modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking, allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering; (iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning (including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL, AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally, the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we discuss in this report.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksei Ilin, Gor Matevosyan, Xueying Ma, Vladimir Eremin, Suhaa Dada, Muqun Li, Riyaaz Shaik, Haluk Noyan Tokgozoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingda Zhang, Na Zhao, Jianglong Qin, Guoyu Ye, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kalana Wijegunarathna, Kristin Stock, Christopher B. Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps. Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this method into a georeferencing workflow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo Dentamaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks (vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer, Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy, WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI development.</p>

Our findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Song, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Yingfa Chen, Yuxuan Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulai Zhao, Haolin Liu, Dian Yu, S. Y. Kung, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step." can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data at https://huggingface.co/sarosavo/Master-RM and https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarosavo/Master-RM.</p>

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anand A. Rajasekar, Nikesh Garera</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic question answering is an important yet challenging task in E-commerce given the millions of questions posted by users about the product that they are interested in purchasing. Hence, there is a great demand for automatic answer generation systems that provide quick responses using related information about the product. There are three sources of knowledge available for answering a user posted query, they are reviews, duplicate or similar questions, and specifications. Effectively utilizing these information sources will greatly aid us in answering complex questions. However, there are two main challenges present in exploiting these sources: (i) The presence of irrelevant information and (ii) the presence of ambiguity of sentiment present in reviews and similar questions. Through this work we propose a novel pipeline (MSQAP) that utilizes the rich information present in the aforementioned sources by separately performing relevancy and ambiguity prediction before generating a response.
  Experimental results show that our relevancy prediction model (BERT-QA) outperforms all other variants and has an improvement of 12.36% in F1 score compared to the BERT-base baseline. Our generation model (T5-QA) outperforms the baselines in all content preservation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and has an average improvement of 35.02% in ROUGE and 198.75% in BLEU compared to the highest performing baseline (HSSC-q). Human evaluation of our pipeline shows us that our method has an overall improvement in accuracy of 30.7% over the generation model (T5-QA), resulting in our full pipeline-based approach (MSQAP) providing more accurate answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the e-commerce domain that automatically generates natural language answers combining the information present in diverse sources such as specifications, similar questions, and reviews data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreekanth M Prabhu, Abhisek Midya</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of spoken languages comprises phonology, morphology, and grammar. The languages can be classified as root languages, inflectional languages, and stem languages. In addition, languages continually change over time and space by picking isoglosses, as speakers move from region to/through region. All these factors lead to the formation of vocabulary, which has commonality/similarity across languages as well as distinct and subtle differences among them. Comparison of vocabularies across languages and detailed analysis has led to the hypothesis of language families. In particular, in the view of Western linguists, Vedic Sanskrit is a daughter language, part of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European Language family, and Dravidian Languages belong to an entirely different family. These and such conclusions are reexamined in this paper. Based on our study and analysis, we propose an Ecosystem Model for Linguistic Development with Sanskrit at the core, in place of the widely accepted family tree model. To that end, we leverage the Paninian system of sounds to construct a phonetic map. Then we represent words across languages as state transitions on the phonetic map and construct corresponding Morphological Finite Automata (MFA) that accept groups of words. Regardless of whether the contribution of this paper is significant or minor, it is an important step in challenging policy-driven research that has plagued this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the primary challenges in online learning environments, is to retain learner engagement. Several different instructional strategies are proposed both in online and offline environments to enhance learner engagement. The Concept Attainment Model is one such instructional strategy that focuses on learners acquiring a deeper understanding of a concept rather than just its dictionary definition. This is done by searching and listing the properties used to distinguish examples from non-examples of various concepts. Our work attempts to apply the Concept Attainment Model to build conceptual riddles, to deploy over online learning environments. The approach involves creating factual triples from learning resources, classifying them based on their uniqueness to a concept into `Topic Markers' and `Common', followed by generating riddles based on the Concept Attainment Model's format and capturing all possible solutions to those riddles. The results obtained from the human evaluation of riddles prove encouraging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objectieve:This review aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) utilization in mental health care, evaluating their effectiveness, identifying challenges, and exploring their potential for future application. Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. The review includes all types of original research, regardless of peer-review status, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023. Studies were included without language restrictions if they employed LLMs developed after T5 and directly investigated research questions within mental health care settings. Results: Out of an initial 313 articles, 34 were selected based on their relevance to LLMs applications in mental health care and the rigor of their reported outcomes. The review identified various LLMs applications in mental health care, including diagnostics, therapy, and enhancing patient engagement. Key challenges highlighted were related to data availability and reliability, the nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. While LLMs showed promise in improving accuracy and accessibility, significant gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were noted. Conclusion: LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuandong Zhao, Xianjun Yang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Lei Li, Yu-Xiang Wang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p>

<p>Abstract: Consider a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate whether the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. We present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization. We find strong evidence of pressure for entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$. Evidence with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence consistent with the action of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to reduce word order entropy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan F. Schouten, Peter Bloem, Ilia Markov, Piek Vossen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Huang, Xudong Guo, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding reduces the inference latency of a target large language model via utilizing a smaller and faster draft model. Its performance depends on a hyperparameter K -- the candidate length, i.e., the number of candidate tokens for the target model to verify in each round. However, previous methods often use simple heuristics to choose K, which may result in sub-optimal performance. We study the choice of the candidate length K and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We theoretically show that the optimal policy of this Markov decision process takes the form of a threshold policy, i.e., the current speculation should stop and be verified when the probability of getting a rejection exceeds a threshold value. Motivated by this theory, we propose SpecDec++, an enhanced version of speculative decoding that adaptively determines the candidate length on the fly. We augment the draft model with a trained acceptance prediction head to predict the conditional acceptance probability of the candidate tokens. SpecDec++ will stop the current speculation when the predicted probability that at least one token gets rejected exceeds a threshold. We implement SpecDec++ and apply it to the llama-2-chat 7B & 70B model pair. Our adaptive method achieves a 2.04x speedup on the Alpaca dataset (7.2% improvement over the baseline speculative decoding). On the GSM8K and HumanEval datasets, our method achieves a 2.26x speedup (9.4% improvement) and 2.23x speedup (11.1% improvement), respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzuf Paz-Argaman, Itai Mondshine, Asaf Achi Mordechai, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks in English, their performance in lower-resourced languages like Hebrew, especially for generative tasks such as abstractive summarization, remains unclear. The high morphological richness in Hebrew adds further challenges due to the ambiguity in sentence comprehension and the complexities in meaning construction. In this paper, we address this resource and evaluation gap by introducing HeSum, a novel benchmark specifically designed for abstractive text summarization in Modern Hebrew. HeSum consists of 10,000 article-summary pairs sourced from Hebrew news websites written by professionals. Linguistic analysis confirms HeSum's high abstractness and unique morphological challenges. We show that HeSum presents distinct difficulties for contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, establishing it as a valuable testbed for generative language technology in Hebrew, and MRLs generative challenges in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Wen, Keping Bi, Wei Chen, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become an important way of information access, there have been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread of unethical content, including implicit bias that hurts certain populations without explicit harmful words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development. Our code, data, and benchmarks are available at https://yuchenwen1.github.io/ImplicitBiasEvaluation/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usneek Singh, Jos\'e Cambronero, Sumit Gulwani, Aditya Kanade, Anirudh Khatry, Vu Le, Mukul Singh, Gust Verbruggen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Wei, Yuqi Liu, N. Benjamin Erichson</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Zeng, Yizhong Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Pang Wei Koh</p>
<p>Abstract: An ideal model evaluation should achieve two goals: identifying where the model fails and providing actionable improvement guidance. Toward these goals for language model (LM) evaluations, we formulate the problem of generating a weakness profile, a set of weaknesses expressed in natural language, given an LM's performance on every individual instance in a benchmark. We introduce a suite of quantitative assessments to compare different weakness profiling methods. We also introduce a weakness profiling method EvalTree. EvalTree constructs a capability tree where each node represents a capability described in natural language and is linked to a subset of benchmark instances that specifically evaluate this capability; it then extracts nodes where the LM performs poorly to generate a weakness profile. On the MATH and WildChat benchmarks, we show that EvalTree outperforms baseline weakness profiling methods by identifying weaknesses more precisely and comprehensively. Weakness profiling further enables weakness-guided data collection, and training data collection guided by EvalTree-identified weaknesses improves LM performance more than other data collection strategies. We also show how EvalTree exposes flaws in Chatbot Arena's human-voter-based evaluation practice. To facilitate future work, we provide an interface that allows practitioners to interactively explore the capability trees built by EvalTree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Su, Krishna Sayana, Hubert Pham, James Pine, Yuri Vasilevski, Raghavendra Vasudeva, Marialena Kyriakidi, Liam Hebert, Ambarish Jash, Anushya Subbiah, Sukhdeep Sodhi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction. REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences.
  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13857">Enabling Inclusive Systematic Reviews: Incorporating Preprint Articles with Large Language Model-Driven Evaluations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yang, Jiayi Tong, Haoyuan Wang, Hui Huang, Ziyang Hu, Peiyu Li, Nan Liu, Christopher J. Lindsell, Michael J. Pencina, Yong Chen, Chuan Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Background. Systematic reviews in comparative effectiveness research require timely evidence synthesis. Preprints accelerate knowledge dissemination but vary in quality, posing challenges for systematic reviews.
  Methods. We propose AutoConfidence (automated confidence assessment), an advanced framework for predicting preprint publication, which reduces reliance on manual curation and expands the range of predictors, including three key advancements: (1) automated data extraction using natural language processing techniques, (2) semantic embeddings of titles and abstracts, and (3) large language model (LLM)-driven evaluation scores. Additionally, we employed two prediction models: a random forest classifier for binary outcome and a survival cure model that predicts both binary outcome and publication risk over time.
  Results. The random forest classifier achieved AUROC 0.692 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.733 with semantic embeddings and 0.747 with article usage metrics. The survival cure model reached AUROC 0.716 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.731 with semantic embeddings. For publication risk prediction, it achieved a concordance index of 0.658, increasing to 0.667 with semantic embeddings.
  Conclusion. Our study advances the framework for preprint publication prediction through automated data extraction and multiple feature integration. By combining semantic embeddings with LLM-driven evaluations, AutoConfidence enhances predictive performance while reducing manual annotation burden. The framework has the potential to facilitate incorporation of preprint articles during the appraisal phase of systematic reviews, supporting researchers in more effective utilization of preprint resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on multi-turn reasoning datasets requires N (number of turns) separate forward passes per conversation due to reasoning token visibility constraints, as reasoning tokens for a turn are discarded in subsequent turns. We propose duplicating response tokens along with a custom attention mask to enable single-pass processing of entire conversations. We prove our method produces identical losses to the N-pass approach while reducing time complexity from $O\bigl(N^{3}\bigl)$ to $O\bigl(N^{2}\bigl)$ and maintaining the same memory complexity for a transformer based model.

Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present the results of a replication study assessing the vulnerabilities across all LLMs provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Feder Cooper, Aaron Gokaslan, Ahmed Ahmed, Amy B. Cyphert, Christopher De Sa, Mark A. Lemley, Daniel E. Ho, Percy Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the Books3 dataset from 17 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from different LLMs. This is evidence that these LLMs have memorized the extracted text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't memorize most books--either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and 1984, almost entirely. In fact, Harry Potter is so memorized that, using a seed prompt consisting of just the first line of chapter 1, we can deterministically generate the entire book near-verbatim. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context, German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. We pre-trained GeistBERT using fairseq, following the RoBERTa base configuration with Whole Word Masking (WWM), and initialized from GottBERT weights. The model was trained on a 1.3 TB German corpus with dynamic masking and a fixed sequence length of 512 tokens. For evaluation, we fine-tuned the model on standard downstream tasks, including NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014), text classification (GermEval 2018 coarse/fine, 10kGNAD), and NLI (German XNLI), using $F_1$ score and accuracy as evaluation metrics. GeistBERT achieved strong results across all tasks, leading among base models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in GermEval 2018 fine text classification. It also outperformed several larger models, particularly in classification benchmarks. To support research in German NLP, we release GeistBERT under the MIT license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Hayase, Alisa Liu, Noah A. Smith, Sewoong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations, an issue known as the Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP). For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. While this heuristic is effective in English, the underlying PBP continues to affect languages such as Chinese as well as code generation, where tokens often do not line up with word and syntactic boundaries. In this work, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM. Our method efficiently solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time or transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals. Code is available at https://github.com/SewoongLab/byte-sampler .</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of conversational assistants has fundamentally reshaped user interactions with digital platforms. This paper introduces Flippi-a cutting-edge, end-to-end conversational assistant powered by large language models (LLMs) and tailored for the e-commerce sector. Flippi addresses the challenges posed by the vast and often overwhelming product landscape, enabling customers to discover products more efficiently through natural language dialogue. By accommodating both objective and subjective user requirements, Flippi delivers a personalized shopping experience that surpasses traditional search methods. This paper details how Flippi interprets customer queries to provide precise product information, leveraging advanced NLP techniques such as Query Reformulation, Intent Detection, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Context Reduction. Flippi's unique capability to identify and present the most attractive offers on an e-commerce site is also explored, demonstrating how it empowers users to make cost-effective decisions. Additionally, the paper discusses Flippi's comparative analysis features, which help users make informed choices by contrasting product features, prices, and other relevant attributes. The system's robust architecture is outlined, emphasizing its adaptability for integration across various e-commerce platforms and the technological choices underpinning its performance and accuracy. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation framework is presented, covering performance metrics, user satisfaction, and the impact on customer engagement and conversion rates. By bridging the convenience of online shopping with the personalized assistance traditionally found in physical stores, Flippi sets a new standard for customer satisfaction and engagement in the digital marketplace.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan B. Guti\'errez</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248">Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean-Philippe Corbeil, Minseon Kim, Alessandro Sordoni, Francois Beaulieu, Paul Vozila</p>
<p>Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varin Sikka, Vishal Sikka</p>
<p>Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sammy Khalife, Yann Ponty, Laurent Bulteau</p>
<p>Abstract: Several popular language models represent local contexts in an input text $x$ as bags of words. Such representations are naturally encoded by a sequence graph whose vertices are the distinct words occurring in $x$, with edges representing the (ordered) co-occurrence of two words within a sliding window of size $w$. However, this compressed representation is not generally bijective: some may be ambiguous, admitting several realizations as a sequence, while others may not admit any realization. In this paper, we study the realizability and ambiguity of sequence graphs from a combinatorial and algorithmic point of view. We consider the existence and enumeration of realizations of a sequence graph under multiple settings: window size $w$, presence/absence of graph orientation, and presence/absence of weights (multiplicities). When $w=2$, we provide polynomial time algorithms for realizability and enumeration in all cases except the undirected/weighted setting, where we show the $\#$P-hardness of enumeration. For $w \ge 3$, we prove the hardness of all variants, even when $w$ is considered as a constant, with the notable exception of the undirected unweighted case for which we propose XP algorithms for both problems, tight due to a corresponding $W[1]-$hardness result. We conclude with an integer program formulation to solve the realizability problem, and a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the enumeration problem in instances of moderate sizes. This work leaves open the membership to NP of both problems, a non-trivial question due to the existence of minimum realizations having size exponential on the instance encoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyu Du, Sebastian Esser, Stavros Nousias, Andr\'e Borrmann</p>
<p>Abstract: The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathew Jacob, Erik Lindgren, Matei Zaharia, Michael Carbin, Omar Khattab, Andrew Drozdov</p>
<p>Abstract: Rerankers, typically cross-encoders, are computationally intensive but are frequently used because they are widely assumed to outperform cheaper initial IR systems. We challenge this assumption by measuring reranker performance for full retrieval, not just re-scoring first-stage retrieval. To provide a more robust evaluation, we prioritize strong first-stage retrieval using modern dense embeddings and test rerankers on a variety of carefully chosen, challenging tasks, including internally curated datasets to avoid contamination, and out-of-domain ones. Our empirical results reveal a surprising trend: the best existing rerankers provide initial improvements when scoring progressively more documents, but their effectiveness gradually declines and can even degrade quality beyond a certain limit. We hope that our findings will spur future research to improve reranking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rin Ashizawa, Yoichi Hirose, Nozomu Yoshinari, Kento Uchida, Shinichi Shirakawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer. Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results. Our experimental code is provided at https://github.com/shiralab/OPTS .</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01403">Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model: A New Paradigm for E-commerce Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Pang, Chunyuan Yuan, Xiaoyu He, Zheng Fang, Donghao Xie, Fanyi Qu, Xue Jiang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Ching Law, Jingping Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanchaita Hazra, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Tuhin Chakrabarty</p>
<p>Abstract: Current efforts in AI safety prioritize filtering harmful content, preventing manipulation of human behavior, and eliminating existential risks in cybersecurity or biosecurity. While pressing, this narrow focus overlooks critical human-centric considerations that shape the long-term trajectory of a society. In this position paper, we identify the risks of overlooking the impact of AI on the future of work and recommend comprehensive transition support towards the evolution of meaningful labor with human agency. Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of AI on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in AI development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train AI models. We strongly recommend a pro-worker framework of global AI governance to enhance shared prosperity and economic justice while reducing technical debt.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08846">Addressing Pitfalls in Auditing Practices of Automatic Speech Recognition Technologies: A Case Study of People with Aphasia</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Katelyn Xiaoying Mei, Anna Seo Gyeong Choi, Hilke Schellmann, Mona Sloane, Allison Koenecke</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has transformed daily tasks from video transcription to workplace hiring. ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and standardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and equitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and language disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR systems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in existing standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them impacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance for aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text standardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR performance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be consistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech communities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second, audits often display high-level demographic findings without further considering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic subgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the input audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the Word Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising from generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a more holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and exemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR performance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group. We call on practitioners to implement these robust ASR auditing practices that remain flexible to the rapidly changing ASR landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liang, Hongyao Tang, Yi Ma, Jinyi Liu, Yan Zheng, Shuyue Hu, Lei Bai, Jianye Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent (https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent). The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nesrine Fourati, Alisa Barkar, Marion Drag\'ee, Liv Danthon-Lefebvre, Mathieu Chollet</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Public speaking is a vital professional skill, yet it remains a source of significant anxiety for many individuals. Traditional training relies heavily on expert coaching, but recent advances in AI has led to novel types of commercial automated public speaking feedback tools. However, most research has focused on prototypes rather than commercial applications, and little is known about how public speaking experts perceive these tools.
  Objectives: This study aims to evaluate expert opinions on the efficacy and design of commercial AI-based public speaking training tools and to propose guidelines for their improvement.
  Methods: The research involved 16 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups with public speaking experts. Participants discussed their views on current commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional coaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.
  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools, emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model combining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.</p>
