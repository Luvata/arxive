<p>Abstract: Hands are the primary means through which humans interact with the world. Reliable and always-available hand pose inference could yield new and intuitive control schemes for human-computer interactions, particularly in virtual and augmented reality. Computer vision is effective but requires one or multiple cameras and can struggle with occlusions, limited field of view, and poor lighting. Wearable wrist-based surface electromyography (sEMG) presents a promising alternative as an always-available modality sensing muscle activities that drive hand motion. However, sEMG signals are strongly dependent on user anatomy and sensor placement, and existing sEMG models have required hundreds of users and device placements to effectively generalize. To facilitate progress on sEMG pose inference, we introduce the emg2pose benchmark, the largest publicly available dataset of high-quality hand pose labels and wrist sEMG recordings. emg2pose contains 2kHz, 16 channel sEMG and pose labels from a 26-camera motion capture rig for 193 users, 370 hours, and 29 stages with diverse gestures - a scale comparable to vision-based hand pose datasets. We provide competitive baselines and challenging tasks evaluating real-world generalization scenarios: held-out users, sensor placements, and stages. emg2pose provides the machine learning community a platform for exploring complex generalization problems, holding potential to significantly enhance the development of sEMG-based human-computer interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report presents Prithvi-EO-2.0, a new geospatial foundation model that offers significant improvements over its predecessor, Prithvi-EO-1.0. Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub. The project exemplifies the Trusted Open Science approach embraced by all involved organizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaofeng Hu, Sifan Zhou, Shibo Zhao, Zhihang Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D single object tracking is essential in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02759">Mixture of Physical Priors Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaozhi Wang, Conghu Li, Qixiang Ye, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods rely on low-rank representations to adapt models. However, these approaches often oversimplify representations, particularly when the underlying data has high-rank or high-frequency components. This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture complex data interactions effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models network weights by leveraging a combination of physical priors, enabling more accurate approximations. We use three foundational equations -- heat diffusion, wave propagation, and Poisson's steady-state equation -- each contributing distinctive modeling properties: heat diffusion enforces local smoothness, wave propagation facilitates long-range interactions, and Poisson's equation captures global equilibrium. To combine these priors effectively, we introduce the Mixture of Physical Priors Adapter (MoPPA), using an efficient Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) implementation. To dynamically balance these priors, a route regularization mechanism is designed to adaptively tune their contributions. MoPPA serves as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into transformer architectures, with adaptable complexity depending on the local context. Specifically, using MAE pre-trained ViT-B, MoPPA improves PEFT accuracy by up to 2.1% on VTAB-1K image classification with a comparable number of trainable parameters, and advantages are further validated through experiments across various vision backbones, showcasing MoPPA's effectiveness and adaptability. The code will be made public available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijiao Yang, Xiangxi Shi, Eric Slyman, Stefan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Assistive embodied agents that can be instructed in natural language to perform tasks in open-world environments have the potential to significantly impact labor tasks like manufacturing or in-home care -- benefiting the lives of those who come to depend on them. In this work, we consider how this benefit might be hijacked by local modifications in the appearance of the agent's operating environment. Specifically, we take the popular Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task as a representative setting and develop a whitebox adversarial attack that optimizes a 3D attack object's appearance to induce desired behaviors in pretrained VLN agents that observe it in the environment. We demonstrate that the proposed attack can cause VLN agents to ignore their instructions and execute alternative actions after encountering the attack object -- even for instructions and agent paths not considered when optimizing the attack. For these novel settings, we find our attacks can induce early-termination behaviors or divert an agent along an attacker-defined multi-step trajectory. Under both conditions, environmental attacks significantly reduce agent capabilities to successfully follow user instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dean Hazineh, Federico Capasso, Todd Zickler</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a $H\times W\times 31$ hyperspectral image from a $H\times W$ grayscale snapshot measurement that is captured using a single diffractive optic and a filterless panchromatic photosensor. This problem is severely ill-posed, and we present the first model that is able to produce high-quality results. We train a conditional denoising diffusion model that maps a small grayscale measurement patch to a hyperspectral patch. We then deploy the model to many patches in parallel, using global physics-based guidance to synchronize the patch predictions. Our model can be trained using small hyperspectral datasets and then deployed to reconstruct hyperspectral images of arbitrary size. Also, by drawing multiple samples with different seeds, our model produces useful uncertainty maps. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous snapshot hyperspectral benchmarks where reconstruction is better conditioned. Our work lays the foundation for a new class of high-resolution hyperspectral imagers that are compact and light-efficient.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02803">Gaussian Splatting Under Attack: Investigating Adversarial Noise in 3D Objects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdurrahman Zeybey, Mehmet Ergezer, Tommy Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has advanced radiance field reconstruction, enabling high-quality view synthesis and fast rendering in 3D modeling. While adversarial attacks on object detection models are well-studied for 2D images, their impact on 3D models remains underexplored. This work introduces the Masked Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (M-IFGSM), designed to generate adversarial noise targeting the CLIP vision-language model. M-IFGSM specifically alters the object of interest by focusing perturbations on masked regions, degrading the performance of CLIP's zero-shot object detection capability when applied to 3D models. Using eight objects from the Common Objects 3D (CO3D) dataset, we demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the accuracy and confidence of the model, with adversarial noise being nearly imperceptible to human observers. The top-1 accuracy in original model renders drops from 95.4\% to 12.5\% for train images and from 91.2\% to 35.4\% for test images, with confidence levels reflecting this shift from true classification to misclassification, underscoring the risks of adversarial attacks on 3D models in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. The significance of this research lies in its potential to expose vulnerabilities in modern 3D vision models, including radiance fields, prompting the development of more robust defenses and security measures in critical real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02805">STORM: Strategic Orchestration of Modalities for Rare Event Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Payal Kamboj, Ayan Banerjee, Sandeep K. S. Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In domains such as biomedical, expert insights are crucial for selecting the most informative modalities for artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. However, using all available modalities poses challenges, particularly in determining the impact of each modality on performance and optimizing their combinations for accurate classification. Traditional approaches resort to manual trial and error methods, lacking systematic frameworks for discerning the most relevant modalities. Moreover, although multi-modal learning enables the integration of information from diverse sources, utilizing all available modalities is often impractical and unnecessary. To address this, we introduce an entropy-based algorithm STORM to solve the modality selection problem for rare event. This algorithm systematically evaluates the information content of individual modalities and their combinations, identifying the most discriminative features essential for rare class classification tasks. Through seizure onset zone detection case study, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing classification performance. By selecting useful subset of modalities, our approach paves the way for more efficient AI-driven biomedical analyses, thereby advancing disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Ruschel, Md Awsafur Rahman, Hardik Prajapati, Suya You, B. S. Manjuanth</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding video content is pivotal for advancing real-world applications like activity recognition, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction. While scene graphs are adept at capturing spatial relationships between objects in individual frames, extending these representations to capture dynamic interactions across video sequences remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present TCDSG, Temporally Consistent Dynamic Scene Graphs, an innovative end-to-end framework that detects, tracks, and links subject-object relationships across time, generating action tracklets, temporally consistent sequences of entities and their interactions. Our approach leverages a novel bipartite matching mechanism, enhanced by adaptive decoder queries and feedback loops, ensuring temporal coherence and robust tracking over extended sequences. This method not only establishes a new benchmark by achieving over 60% improvement in temporal recall@k on the Action Genome, OpenPVSG, and MEVA datasets but also pioneers the augmentation of MEVA with persistent object ID annotations for comprehensive tracklet generation. By seamlessly integrating spatial and temporal dynamics, our work sets a new standard in multi-frame video analysis, opening new avenues for high-impact applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryce Hopkins, Leo ONeill, Michael Marinaccio, Eric Rowell, Russell Parsons, Sarah Flanary, Irtija Nazim, Carl Seielstad, Fatemeh Afghah</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing accessibility of radiometric thermal imaging sensors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers significant potential for advancing AI-driven aerial wildfire management. Radiometric imaging provides per-pixel temperature estimates, a valuable improvement over non-radiometric data that requires irradiance measurements to be converted into visible images using RGB color palettes. Despite its benefits, this technology has been underutilized largely due to a lack of available data for researchers. This study addresses this gap by introducing methods for collecting and processing synchronized visual spectrum and radiometric thermal imagery using UAVs at prescribed fires. The included imagery processing pipeline drastically simplifies and partially automates each step from data collection to neural network input. Further, we present the FLAME 3 dataset, the first comprehensive collection of side-by-side visual spectrum and radiometric thermal imagery of wildland fires. Building on our previous FLAME 1 and FLAME 2 datasets, FLAME 3 includes radiometric thermal Tag Image File Format (TIFFs) and nadir thermal plots, providing a new data type and collection method. This dataset aims to spur a new generation of machine learning models utilizing radiometric thermal imagery, potentially trivializing tasks such as aerial wildfire detection, segmentation, and assessment. A single-burn subset of FLAME 3 for computer vision applications is available on Kaggle with the full 6 burn set available to readers upon request.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02837">Enhancing Robustness of CLIP to Common Corruptions through Bimodal Test-Time Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarthak Kumar Maharana, Baoming Zhang, Leonid Karlinsky, Rogerio Feris, Yunhui Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Although open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated strong zero-shot learning capabilities, their robustness to common image corruptions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions at increasing severity levels during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose \framework, a bimodal TTA method specially designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for better image feature extraction but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in TTA for CLIP, specifically for domains involving image corruption. Particularly, with a ViT-B/16 vision backbone, we obtain mean accuracy improvements of 9.7%, 5.94%, and 5.12% for CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C, respectively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02852">Effortless Efficiency: Low-Cost Pruning of Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhang, Er Jin, Yanfei Dong, Ashkan Khakzar, Philip Torr, Johannes Stegmaier, Kenji Kawaguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive advancements in various vision tasks. However, these gains often rely on increasing model size, which escalates computational complexity and memory demands, complicating deployment, raising inference costs, and causing environmental impact. While some studies have explored pruning techniques to improve the memory efficiency of diffusion models, most existing methods require extensive retraining to retain the model performance. Retraining a modern large diffusion model is extremely costly and resource-intensive, which limits the practicality of these methods. In this work, we achieve low-cost diffusion pruning without retraining by proposing a model-agnostic structural pruning framework for diffusion models that learns a differentiable mask to sparsify the model. To ensure effective pruning that preserves the quality of the final denoised latent, we design a novel end-to-end pruning objective that spans the entire diffusion process. As end-to-end pruning is memory-intensive, we further propose time step gradient checkpointing, a technique that significantly reduces memory usage during optimization, enabling end-to-end pruning within a limited memory budget. Results on state-of-the-art U-Net diffusion models SDXL and diffusion transformers (FLUX) demonstrate that our method can effectively prune up to 20% parameters with minimal perceptible performance degradation, and notably, without the need for model retraining. We also showcase that our method can still prune on top of time step distilled diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a method for efficiently detecting objects within 3D point clouds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach adopts a unique feature-centric voting mechanism to construct convolutional layers that capitalize on the typical sparsity observed in input data. We explore the trade-off between accuracy and speed across diverse network architectures and advocate for integrating an $\mathcal{L}_1$ penalty on filter activations to augment sparsity within intermediate layers. This research pioneers the proposal of sparse convolutional layers combined with $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularization to effectively handle large-scale 3D data processing. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the MVTec 3D-AD object detection benchmark. The Vote3Deep models, with just three layers, outperform the previous state-of-the-art in both laser-only approaches and combined laser-vision methods. Additionally, they maintain competitive processing speeds. This underscores our approach's capability to substantially enhance detection performance while ensuring computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02856">Is Large-Scale Pretraining the Secret to Good Domain Generalization?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Teterwak, Kuniaki Saito, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Bryan A. Plummer, Kate Saenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Source Domain Generalization (DG) is the task of training on multiple source domains and achieving high classification performance on unseen target domains. Recent methods combine robust features from web-scale pretrained backbones with new features learned from source data, and this has dramatically improved benchmark results. However, it remains unclear if DG finetuning methods are becoming better over time, or if improved benchmark performance is simply an artifact of stronger pre-training. Prior studies have shown that perceptual similarity to pre-training data correlates with zero-shot performance, but we find the effect limited in the DG setting. Instead, we posit that having perceptually similar data in pretraining is not enough; and that it is how well these data were learned that determines performance. This leads us to introduce the Alignment Hypothesis, which states that the final DG performance will be high if and only if alignment of image and class label text embeddings is high. Our experiments confirm the Alignment Hypothesis is true, and we use it as an analysis tool of existing DG methods evaluated on DomainBed datasets by splitting evaluation data into In-pretraining (IP) and Out-of-pretraining (OOP). We show that all evaluated DG methods struggle on DomainBed-OOP, while recent methods excel on DomainBed-IP. Put together, our findings highlight the need for DG methods which can generalize beyond pretraining alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung-Anh Dang, Vincent Nguyen, Ngoc-Son Vu, Christel Vrain</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) are an important divide in self-supervised learning (SSL) due to their independence from augmentation techniques for generating positive (and/or negative) pairs as in contrastive frameworks. Their masking and reconstruction strategy also nicely aligns with SSL approaches in natural language processing. Most MAEs are built upon Transformer-based architectures where visual features are not regularized as opposed to their convolutional neural network (CNN) based counterparts, which can potentially hinder their performance. To address this, we introduce MAGMA, a novel batch-wide layer-wise regularization loss applied to representations of different Transformer layers. We demonstrate that by plugging in the proposed regularization loss, one can significantly improve the performance of MAE-based models. We further demonstrate the impact of the proposed loss on optimizing other generic SSL approaches (such as VICReg and SimCLR), broadening the impact of the proposed approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Cardei, Sabit Ahmed, Gretchen Chapman, Afsaneh Doryab</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal pairwise movement analysis involves identifying shared geographic-based behaviors between individuals within specific time frames. Traditionally, this task relies on sequence modeling and behavior analysis techniques applied to tabular or video-based data, but these methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture partial matching. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pairwise spatiotemporal partial trajectory matching that transforms tabular spatiotemporal data into interpretable trajectory images based on specified time windows, allowing for partial trajectory analysis. This approach includes localization of trajectories, checking for spatial overlap, and pairwise matching using a Siamese Neural Network. We evaluate our method on a co-walking classification task, demonstrating its effectiveness in a novel co-behavior identification application. Our model surpasses established methods, achieving an F1-score up to 0.73. Additionally, we explore the method's utility for pair routine pattern analysis in real-world scenarios, providing insights into the frequency, timing, and duration of shared behaviors. This approach offers a powerful, interpretable framework for spatiotemporal behavior analysis, with potential applications in social behavior research, urban planning, and healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Colman, Minh Vu, Manish Bhattarai, Martin Ma, Hari Viswanathan, Daniel O'Malley, Javier E. Santos</p>
<p>Abstract: For decades, corporations and governments have relied on scanned documents to record vast amounts of information. However, extracting this information is a slow and tedious process due to the overwhelming amount of documents. The rise of vision language models presents a way to efficiently and accurately extract the information out of these documents. The current automated workflow often requires a two-step approach involving the extraction of information using optical character recognition software, and subsequent usage of large language models for processing this information. Unfortunately, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with noisy scanned documents. The high information density of such documents often necessitates using computationally expensive language models to effectively reduce noise.
  In this study, we propose PatchFinder, an algorithm that builds upon Vision Language Models (VLMs) to address the information extraction task. First, we devise a confidence-based score, called Patch Confidence, based on the Maximum Softmax Probability of the VLMs' output to measure the model's confidence in its predictions. Then, PatchFinder utilizes that score to determine a suitable patch size, partition the input document into overlapping patches of that size, and generate confidence-based predictions for the target information. Our experimental results show that PatchFinder can leverage Phi-3v, a 4.2 billion parameter vision language model, to achieve an accuracy of 94% on our dataset of 190 noisy scanned documents, surpassing the performance of ChatGPT-4o by 18.5 percentage points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitrii Torbunov, Yihui Ren, Animesh Ghose, Odera Dim, Yonggang Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) have emerged as a bio-inspired alternative to traditional cameras, offering advantages in power efficiency, temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for the EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, with a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves remarkable performance, surpassing current state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we show that a properly trained RT-DETR model on the EBC data achieves performance comparable to the most advanced EBC object detection methods. Next, we propose a low-rank adaptation (LoRA)-inspired way to augment the RT-DETR model to handle temporal dynamics of the data. The designed EvRT-DETR model outperforms the current, most advanced results on standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$) while only using standard modules from natural image and video analysis. These results demonstrate that effective EBC object detection can be achieved through careful adaptation of mainstream object detection architectures without requiring specialized architectural engineering.

<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating and forecasting human body pose is important for enhancing the user's sense of immersion in Augmented Reality. Addressing this need, our paper introduces EgoCast, a bimodal method for 3D human pose forecasting using egocentric videos and proprioceptive data. We study the task of human pose forecasting in a realistic setting, extending the boundaries of temporal forecasting in dynamic scenes and building on the current framework for current pose estimation in the wild. We introduce a current-frame estimation module that generates pseudo-groundtruth poses for inference, eliminating the need for past groundtruth poses typically required by current methods during forecasting. Our experimental results on the recent Ego-Exo4D and Aria Digital Twin datasets validate EgoCast for real-life motion estimation. On the Ego-Exo4D Body Pose 2024 Challenge, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, laying the groundwork for future research in human pose estimation and forecasting in unscripted activities with egocentric inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry Petrov, Pradyumn Goyal, Divyansh Shivashok, Yuanming Tao, Melinos Averkiou, Evangelos Kalogerakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ShapeWords, an approach for synthesizing images based on 3D shape guidance and text prompts. ShapeWords incorporates target 3D shape information within specialized tokens embedded together with the input text, effectively blending 3D shape awareness with textual context to guide the image synthesis process. Unlike conventional shape guidance methods that rely on depth maps restricted to fixed viewpoints and often overlook full 3D structure or textual context, ShapeWords generates diverse yet consistent images that reflect both the target shape's geometry and the textual description. Experimental results show that ShapeWords produces images that are more text-compliant, aesthetically plausible, while also maintaining 3D shape awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghan Long, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate a segmentation map of objects and a corresponding image from the prompt. Previous attempts either generate segmentation maps based on the images or provide maps as input conditions to control image generation, limiting their functionality to given inputs. Incorporating an inherent understanding of the scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. To facilitate co-generation with fewer sampling steps, we incorporate a fast diffusion solver into PDM. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fawad Javed Fateh, Umer Ahmed, Hamza Khan, M. Zeeshan Zia, Quoc-Huy Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces TemporalVLM, a video large language model capable of effective temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. At the core, our approach includes a visual encoder for mapping a long-term input video into features which are time-aware and contain both local and global cues. In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Hsuan Huang, Jeng-Lin Li, Chin-Po Chen, Ming-Ching Chang, Wei-Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLM) have significantly enhanced their ability to comprehend visual inputs alongside natural language. However, a major challenge in their real-world application is hallucination, where LVLMs generate non-existent visual elements, eroding user trust. The underlying mechanism driving this multimodal hallucination is poorly understood. Minimal research has illuminated whether contexts such as sky, tree, or grass field involve the LVLM in hallucinating a frisbee. We hypothesize that hidden factors, such as objects, contexts, and semantic foreground-background structures, induce hallucination. This study proposes a novel causal approach: a hallucination probing system to identify these hidden factors. By analyzing the causality between images, text prompts, and network saliency, we systematically explore interventions to block these factors. Our experimental findings show that a straightforward technique based on our analysis can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, our analyses indicate the potential to edit network internals to minimize hallucinated outputs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02960">Semantic Segmentation Prior for Diffusion-Based Real-World Super-Resolution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahua Xiao, Jiawei Zhang, Dongqing Zou, Xiaodan Zhang, Jimmy Ren, Xing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) has achieved a remarkable leap by leveraging large-scale text-to-image models, enabling realistic image restoration from given recognition textual prompts. However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> XiuYu Zhang, Zening Luo, Michelle E. Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have exhibited exciting capabilities in generating images and are also very promising for video creation. However, the inference speed of diffusion models is limited by the slow sampling process, restricting its use cases. The sequential denoising steps required for generating a single sample could take tens or hundreds of iterations and thus have become a significant bottleneck. This limitation is more salient for applications that are interactive in nature or require small latency. To address this challenge, we propose Partially Conditioned Patch Parallelism (PCPP) to accelerate the inference of high-resolution diffusion models. Using the fact that the difference between the images in adjacent diffusion steps is nearly zero, Patch Parallelism (PP) leverages multiple GPUs communicating asynchronously to compute patches of an image in multiple computing devices based on the entire image (all patches) in the previous diffusion step. PCPP develops PP to reduce computation in inference by conditioning only on parts of the neighboring patches in each diffusion step, which also decreases communication among computing devices. As a result, PCPP decreases the communication cost by around $70\%$ compared to DistriFusion (the state of the art implementation of PP) and achieves $2.36\sim 8.02\times$ inference speed-up using $4\sim 8$ GPUs compared to $2.32\sim 6.71\times$ achieved by DistriFusion depending on the computing device configuration and resolution of generation at the cost of a possible decrease in image quality. PCPP demonstrates the potential to strike a favorable trade-off, enabling high-quality image generation with substantially reduced latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: In medical reporting, the accuracy of radiological reports, whether generated by humans or machine learning algorithms, is critical. We tackle a new task in this paper: image-conditioned autocorrection of inaccuracies within these reports. Using the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we first intentionally introduce a diverse range of errors into reports. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage framework capable of pinpointing these errors and then making corrections, simulating an \textit{autocorrection} process. This method aims to address the shortcomings of existing automated medical reporting systems, like factual errors and incorrect conclusions, enhancing report reliability in vital healthcare applications. Importantly, our approach could serve as a guardrail, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of automated report generation. Experiments on established datasets and state of the art report generation models validate this method's potential in correcting medical reporting errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongcheng Li, Lingcong Cai, Ying Lu, Xianghua Fu, Xiao Han, Ma Li, Wenxing Lai, Xiangzhong Zhang, Xiaomao Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Blood cell identification is critical for hematological analysis as it aids physicians in diagnosing various blood-related diseases. In real-world scenarios, blood cell image datasets often present the issues of domain shift and data imbalance, posing challenges for accurate blood cell identification. To address these issues, we propose a novel blood cell classification method termed SADA via stain-aware domain alignment. The primary objective of this work is to mine domain-invariant features in the presence of domain shifts and data imbalances. To accomplish this objective, we propose a stain-based augmentation approach and a local alignment constraint to learn domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we propose a domain-invariant supervised contrastive learning strategy to capture discriminative features. We decouple the training process into two stages of domain-invariant feature learning and classification training, alleviating the problem of data imbalance. Experiment results on four public blood cell datasets and a private real dataset collected from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University demonstrate that SADA can achieve a new state-of-the-art baseline, which is superior to the existing cutting-edge methods with a big margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Zhang, Hang Guo, Siyuan Yang, Qingli Li, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pathological cell semantic segmentation is a fundamental technology in computational pathology, essential for applications like cancer diagnosis and effective treatment. Given that multiple cell types exist across various organs, with subtle differences in cell size and shape, multi-organ, multi-class cell segmentation is particularly challenging. Most existing methods employ multi-branch frameworks to enhance feature extraction, but often result in complex architectures. Moreover, reliance on visual information limits performance in multi-class analysis due to intricate textural details. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-OrgaN multi-Class cell semantic segmentation method with a single brancH (MONCH) that leverages vision-language input. Specifically, we design a hierarchical feature extraction mechanism to provide coarse-to-fine-grained features for segmenting cells of various shapes, including high-frequency, convolutional, and topological features. Inspired by the synergy of textual and multi-grained visual features, we introduce a progressive prompt decoder to harmonize multimodal information, integrating features from fine to coarse granularity for better context capture. Extensive experiments on the PanNuke dataset, which has significant class imbalance and subtle cell size and shape variations, demonstrate that MONCH outperforms state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods and vision-language models. Codes and implementations will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Tang, Chunxiao Zu, Wenxin Su, Yuan Dong, Mao Ye, Yan Gan, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation(FSS)aim to adapt a pre-trained model to new classes with as few as a single labeled training sample per class. The existing prototypical work used in natural image scenarios biasedly focus on capturing foreground's discrimination while employing a simplistic representation for background, grounded on the inherent observation separation between foreground and background. However, this paradigm is not applicable to medical images where the foreground and background share numerous visual features, necessitating a more detailed description for background. In this paper, we present a new pluggable Background-fused prototype(Bro)approach for FSS in medical images. Instead of finding a commonality of background subjects in support image, Bro incorporates this background with two pivot designs. Specifically, Feature Similarity Calibration(FeaC)initially reduces noise in the support image by employing feature cross-attention with the query image. Subsequently, Hierarchical Channel Adversarial Attention(HiCA)merges the background into comprehensive prototypes. We achieve this by a channel groups-based attention mechanism, where an adversarial Mean-Offset structure encourages a coarse-to-fine fusion. Extensive experiments show that previous state-of-the-art methods, when paired with Bro, experience significant performance improvements. This demonstrates a more integrated way to represent backgrounds specifically for medical image.</p>

<p>Abstract: In clinical practice of echocardiography examinations, multiple planes containing the heart structures of different view are usually required in screening, diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. AI models for echocardiography have to be tailored for each specific plane due to the dramatic structure differences, thus resulting in repetition development and extra complexity. Effective solution for such a multi-plane segmentation (MPS) problem is highly demanded for medical images, yet has not been well investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, EchoONE, for this problem with a SAM-based segmentation architecture, a prior-composable mask learning (PC-Mask) module for semantic-aware dense prompt generation, and a learnable CNN-branch with a simple yet effective local feature fusion and adaption (LFFA) module for SAM adapting. We extensively evaluated our method on multiple internal and external echocardiography datasets, and achieved consistently state-of-the-art performance for multi-source datasets with different heart planes. This is the first time that the MPS problem is solved in one model for echocardiography data. The code will be available at https://github.com/a2502503/EchoONE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) objects have wide applications. Despite the growing interest in 3D modeling in academia and industries, designing and/or creating 3D objects from scratch remains time-consuming and challenging. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI), designers discover a new way to create images for ideation. However, generative AIs are less useful in creating 3D objects with satisfying qualities. To allow 3D designers to access a wide range of 3D objects for creative activities based on their specific demands, we propose a machine learning (ML) enhanced framework CLAS - named after the four-step of capture, label, associate, and search - to enable fully automatic retrieval of 3D objects based on user specifications leveraging the existing datasets of 3D objects. CLAS provides an effective and efficient method for any person or organization to benefit from their existing but not utilized 3D datasets. In addition, CLAS may also be used to produce high-quality 3D object synthesis datasets for training and evaluating 3D generative models. As a proof of concept, we created and showcased a search system with a web user interface (UI) for retrieving 6,778 3D objects of chairs in the ShapeNet dataset powered by CLAS. In a close-set retrieval setting, our retrieval method achieves a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.58, top 1 accuracy of 42.27%, and top 10 accuracy of 89.64%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, yet their robustness in dynamic real-world scenarios remains largely unexplored. To systematically evaluate VLMs' robustness to real-world 3D variations, we propose AdvDreamer, the first framework that generates physically reproducible adversarial 3D transformation (Adv-3DT) samples from single-view images. AdvDreamer integrates advanced generative techniques with two key innovations and aims to characterize the worst-case distributions of 3D variations from natural images. To ensure adversarial effectiveness and method generality, we introduce an Inverse Semantic Probability Objective that executes adversarial optimization on fundamental vision-text alignment spaces, which can be generalizable across different VLM architectures and downstream tasks. To mitigate the distribution discrepancy between generated and real-world samples while maintaining physical reproducibility, we design a Naturalness Reward Model that provides regularization feedback during adversarial optimization, preventing convergence towards hallucinated and unnatural elements. Leveraging AdvDreamer, we establish MM3DTBench, the first VQA dataset for benchmarking VLMs' 3D variations robustness. Extensive evaluations on representative VLMs with diverse architectures highlight that 3D variations in the real world may pose severe threats to model performance across various tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating multi-view human images from a single view is a complex and significant challenge. Although recent advancements in multi-view object generation have shown impressive results with diffusion models, novel view synthesis for humans remains constrained by the limited availability of 3D human datasets. Consequently, many existing models struggle to produce realistic human body shapes or capture fine-grained facial details accurately. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework that leverages transferred body and facial representations for multi-view human synthesis. Specifically, we use a single-view model pretrained on a large-scale human dataset to develop a multi-view body representation, aiming to extend the 2D knowledge of the single-view model to a multi-view diffusion model. Additionally, to enhance the model's detail restoration capability, we integrate transferred multimodal facial features into our trained human diffusion model. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in multi-view human synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Yu, Tomohiro Fukuda, Nobuyoshi Yabuki</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-flood building damage assessment is critical for rapid response and post-disaster reconstruction planning. Current research fails to consider the distinct requirements of disaster assessment (DA) from change detection (CD) in neural network design. This paper focuses on two key differences: 1) building change features in DA satellite images are more subtle than in CD; 2) DA datasets face more severe data scarcity and label imbalance. To address these issues, in terms of model architecture, the research explores the benchmark performance of attention mechanisms in post-flood DA tasks and introduces Simple Prior Attention UNet (SPAUNet) to enhance the model's ability to recognize subtle changes, in terms of semi-supervised learning (SSL) strategies, the paper constructs four different combinations of image-level label category reference distributions for consistent training. Experimental results on flood events of xBD dataset show that SPAUNet performs exceptionally well in supervised learning experiments, achieving a recall of 79.10\% and an F1 score of 71.32\% for damaged classification, outperforming CD methods. The results indicate the necessity of DA task-oriented model design. SSL experiments demonstrate the positive impact of image-level consistency regularization on the model. Using pseudo-labels to form the reference distribution for consistency training yields the best results, proving the potential of using the category distribution of a large amount of unlabeled data for SSL. This paper clarifies the differences between DA and CD tasks. It preliminarily explores model design strategies utilizing prior attention mechanisms and image-level consistency regularization, establishing new post-flood DA task benchmark methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingchen Sun, Rongyuan Wu, Zhiyuan Ma, Shuaizheng Liu, Qiaosi Yi, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion prior-based methods have shown impressive results in real-world image super-resolution (SR). However, most existing methods entangle pixel-level and semantic-level SR objectives in the training process, struggling to balance pixel-wise fidelity and perceptual quality. Meanwhile, users have varying preferences on SR results, thus it is demanded to develop an adjustable SR model that can be tailored to different fidelity-perception preferences during inference without re-training. We present Pixel-level and Semantic-level Adjustable SR (PiSA-SR), which learns two LoRA modules upon the pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model to achieve improved and adjustable SR results. We first formulate the SD-based SR problem as learning the residual between the low-quality input and the high-quality output, then show that the learning objective can be decoupled into two distinct LoRA weight spaces: one is characterized by the $\ell_2$-loss for pixel-level regression, and another is characterized by the LPIPS and classifier score distillation losses to extract semantic information from pre-trained classification and SD models. In its default setting, PiSA-SR can be performed in a single diffusion step, achieving leading real-world SR results in both quality and efficiency. By introducing two adjustable guidance scales on the two LoRA modules to control the strengths of pixel-wise fidelity and semantic-level details during inference, PiSASR can offer flexible SR results according to user preference without re-training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huijiao Wang, Shenghao Zhao, Lei Yu, Xulei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality degradation caused by raindrops is one of the most important but challenging problems that reduce the performance of vision systems. Most existing raindrop removal algorithms are based on a supervised learning method using pairwise images, which are hard to obtain in real-world applications. This study proposes a deep neural network for raindrop removal based on unsupervised learning, which only requires two unpaired image sets with and without raindrops. Our proposed model performs layer separation based on cycle network architecture, which aims to separate a rainy image into a raindrop layer, a transparency mask, and a clean background layer. The clean background layer is the target raindrop removal result, while the transparency mask indicates the spatial locations of the raindrops. In addition, the proposed model applies a feedback mechanism to benefit layer separation by refining low-level representation with high-level information. i.e., the output of the previous iteration is used as input for the next iteration, together with the input image with raindrops. As a result, raindrops could be gradually removed through this feedback manner. Extensive experiments on raindrop benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chang, Xiaohao Chen. Zhichao Wei, Xuanpu Zhang, Qing-Guo Chen, Weihua Luo, Xun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Virtual Try-on aims to fluently transfer the garment image to a semantically aligned try-on area in the source person video. Previous methods leveraged the inpainting mask to remove the original garment in the source video, thus achieving accurate garment transfer on simple model videos. However, when these methods are applied to realistic video data with more complex scene changes and posture movements, the overly large and incoherent agnostic masks will destroy the essential spatial-temporal information of the original video, thereby inhibiting the fidelity and coherence of the try-on video. To alleviate this problem, %avoid the inherent deficiencies of mask-based try-on paradigm, we propose a novel point-enhanced mask-free video virtual try-on framework (PEMF-VVTO). Specifically, we first leverage the pre-trained mask-based try-on model to construct large-scale paired training data (pseudo-person samples). Training on these mask-free data enables our model to perceive the original spatial-temporal information while realizing accurate garment transfer. Then, based on the pre-acquired sparse frame-cloth and frame-frame point alignments, we design the point-enhanced spatial attention (PSA) and point-enhanced temporal attention (PTA) to further improve the try-on accuracy and video coherence of the mask-free model. Concretely, PSA explicitly guides the garment transfer to desirable locations through the sparse semantic alignments of video frames and cloth. PTA exploits the temporal attention on sparse point correspondences to enhance the smoothness of generated videos. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments clearly illustrate that our PEMF-VVTO can generate more natural and coherent try-on videos than existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchao Zhu, Ruining Deng, Tianyuan Yao, Juming Xiong, Chongyu Qu, Junlin Guo, Siqi Lu, Mengmeng Yin, Yu Wang, Shilin Zhao, Haichun Yang, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables medical computer vision scientists to automatically interpret the molecular profiles underlying morphological features. Currently, however, most deep learning-based ST analyses are limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections, which can introduce diagnostic errors due to the heterogeneity of pathological tissues across 3D sections. Expanding ST to three-dimensional (3D) volumes is challenging due to the prohibitive costs; a 2D ST acquisition already costs over 50 times more than whole slide imaging (WSI), and a full 3D volume with 10 sections can be an order of magnitude more expensive. To reduce costs, scientists have attempted to predict ST data directly from WSI without performing actual ST acquisition. However, these methods typically yield unsatisfying results. To address this, we introduce a novel problem setting: 3D ST imputation using 3D WSI histology sections combined with a single 2D ST slide. To do so, we present the Anatomy-aware Spatial Imputation Graph Network (ASIGN) for more precise, yet affordable, 3D ST modeling. The ASIGN architecture extends existing 2D spatial relationships into 3D by leveraging cross-layer overlap and similarity-based expansion. Moreover, a multi-level spatial attention graph network integrates features comprehensively across different data sources. We evaluated ASIGN on three public spatial transcriptomics datasets, with experimental results demonstrating that ASIGN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Tan, Hongsong Wang, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the challenge of 3D shape analysis within point cloud data has gathered significant attention in computer vision. Addressing the complexities of effective 3D information representation and meaningful feature extraction for classification tasks remains crucial. This paper presents Point-GR, a novel deep learning architecture designed explicitly to transform unordered raw point clouds into higher dimensions while preserving local geometric features. It introduces residual-based learning within the network to mitigate the point permutation issues in point cloud data. The proposed Point-GR network significantly reduced the number of network parameters in Classification and Part-Segmentation compared to baseline graph-based networks. Notably, the Point-GR model achieves a state-of-the-art scene segmentation mean IoU of 73.47% on the S3DIS benchmark dataset, showcasing its effectiveness. Furthermore, the model shows competitive results in Classification and Part-Segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runjian Chen, Hyoungseob Park, Bo Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Labeling LiDAR point clouds is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming, which spurs recent unsupervised 3D representation learning methods to alleviate the labeling burden in LiDAR perception via pretrained weights. Almost all existing work focus on a single frame of LiDAR point cloud and neglect the temporal LiDAR sequence, which naturally accounts for object motion (and their semantics). Instead, we propose TREND, namely Temporal REndering with Neural fielD, to learn 3D representation via forecasting the future observation in an unsupervised manner. Unlike existing work that follows conventional contrastive learning or masked auto encoding paradigms, TREND integrates forecasting for 3D pre-training through a Recurrent Embedding scheme to generate 3D embedding across time and a Temporal Neural Field to represent the 3D scene, through which we compute the loss using differentiable rendering. To our best knowledge, TREND is the first work on temporal forecasting for unsupervised 3D representation learning. We evaluate TREND on downstream 3D object detection tasks on popular datasets, including NuScenes, Once and Waymo. Experiment results show that TREND brings up to 90% more improvement as compared to previous SOTA unsupervised 3D pre-training methods and generally improve different downstream models across datasets, demonstrating that indeed temporal forecasting brings improvement for LiDAR perception. Codes and models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzieh Mohammadi, Amir Salarpour</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Point-GN, a novel non-parametric network for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud classification. Unlike conventional deep learning models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time environments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03058">Revisiting Energy-Based Model for Out-of-Distribution Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wu, Xichen Ye, Songmin Dai, Dengye Pan, Xiaoqiang Li, Weizhong Zhang, Yifan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an essential approach to robustifying deep learning models, enabling them to identify inputs that fall outside of their trained distribution. Existing OOD detection methods usually depend on crafted data, such as specific outlier datasets or elaborate data augmentations. While this is reasonable, the frequent mismatch between crafted data and OOD data limits model robustness and generalizability. In response to this issue, we introduce Outlier Exposure by Simple Transformations (OEST), a framework that enhances OOD detection by leveraging "peripheral-distribution" (PD) data. Specifically, PD data are samples generated through simple data transformations, thus providing an efficient alternative to manually curated outliers.
  We adopt energy-based models (EBMs) to study PD data. We recognize the "energy barrier" in OOD detection, which characterizes the energy difference between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples and eases detection. PD data are introduced to establish the energy barrier during training. Furthermore, this energy barrier concept motivates a theoretically grounded energy-barrier loss to replace the classical energy-bounded loss, leading to an improved paradigm, OEST*, which achieves a more effective and theoretically sound separation between ID and OOD samples. We perform empirical validation of our proposal, and extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that OEST* achieves better or similar accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runjian Chen, Hang Zhang, Avinash Ravichandran, Wenqi Shao, Alex Wong, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised 3D representation learning via masked-and-reconstruction with differentiable rendering is promising to reduce the labeling burden for fusion 3D perception. However, previous literature conduct pre-training for different modalities separately because of the hight GPU memory consumption. Consequently, the interaction between the two modalities (images and point clouds) is neglected during pre-training. In this paper, we explore joint unsupervised pre-training for fusion 3D perception via differentiable rendering and propose CLAP, short for Curvature sampLing and swApping Prototype assignment prediction. The contributions are three-fold. 1) To overcome the GPU memory consumption problem, we propose Curvature Sampling to sample the more informative points/pixels for pre-training. 2) We propose to use learnable prototypes to represent parts of the scenes in a common feature space and bring the idea of swapping prototype assignment prediction to learn the interaction between the two modalities. 3) To further optimize learnable prototypes, we propose an Expectation-Maximization training scheme to maximize the similarity between embeddings and prototypes, followed by a Gram Matrix Regularization Loss to avoid collapse. Experiment results on NuScenes show that CLAP achieves 300% more performance gain as compared to previous SOTA 3D pre-training method via differentiable rendering. Codes and models will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate video prediction by deep neural networks, especially for dynamic regions, is a challenging task in computer vision for critical applications such as autonomous driving, remote working, and telemedicine. Due to inherent uncertainties, existing prediction models often struggle with the complexity of motion dynamics and occlusions. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic long-term video prediction model that focuses on dynamic regions by employing a hybrid warping strategy. By integrating frames generated through forward and backward warpings, our approach effectively compensates for the weaknesses of each technique, improving the prediction accuracy and realism of moving regions in videos while also addressing uncertainty by making stochastic predictions that account for various motions. Furthermore, considering real-time predictions, we introduce a MobileNet-based lightweight architecture into our model. Our model, called SVPHW, achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liao Qu, Huichao Zhang, Yiheng Liu, Xu Wang, Yi Jiang, Yiming Gao, Hu Ye, Daniel K. Du, Zehuan Yuan, Xinglong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TokenFlow, a novel unified image tokenizer that bridges the long-standing gap between multimodal understanding and generation. Prior research attempt to employ a single reconstruction-targeted Vector Quantization (VQ) encoder for unifying these two tasks. We observe that understanding and generation require fundamentally different granularities of visual information. This leads to a critical trade-off, particularly compromising performance in multimodal understanding tasks. TokenFlow addresses this challenge through an innovative dual-codebook architecture that decouples semantic and pixel-level feature learning while maintaining their alignment via a shared mapping mechanism. This design enables direct access to both high-level semantic representations crucial for understanding tasks and fine-grained visual features essential for generation through shared indices. Our extensive experiments demonstrate TokenFlow's superiority across multiple dimensions. Leveraging TokenFlow, we demonstrate for the first time that discrete visual input can surpass LLaVA-1.5 13B in understanding performance, achieving a 7.2\% average improvement. For image reconstruction, we achieve a strong FID score of 0.63 at 384*384 resolution. Moreover, TokenFlow establishes state-of-the-art performance in autoregressive image generation with a GenEval score of 0.55 at 256*256 resolution, achieving comparable results to SDXL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic view synthesis (DVS) has advanced remarkably in recent years, achieving high-fidelity rendering while reducing computational costs. Despite the progress, optimizing dynamic neural fields from casual videos remains challenging, as these videos do not provide direct 3D information, such as camera trajectories or the underlying scene geometry. In this work, we present RoDyGS, an optimization pipeline for dynamic Gaussian Splatting from casual videos. It effectively learns motion and underlying geometry of scenes by separating dynamic and static primitives, and ensures that the learned motion and geometry are physically plausible by incorporating motion and geometric regularization terms. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark, Kubric-MRig, that provides extensive camera and object motion along with simultaneous multi-view captures, features that are absent in previous benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous pose-free dynamic neural fields and achieves competitive rendering quality compared to existing pose-free static neural fields.

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in monocular depth estimation methods enable high-quality depth estimation of single-view images but fail to estimate consistent video depth across different frames. Recent works address this problem by applying a video diffusion model to generate video depth conditioned on the input video, which is training-expensive and can only produce scale-invariant depth values without camera poses. In this paper, we propose a novel video-depth estimation method called Align3R to estimate temporal consistent depth maps for a dynamic video. Our key idea is to utilize the recent DUSt3R model to align estimated monocular depth maps of different timesteps. First, we fine-tune the DUSt3R model with additional estimated monocular depth as inputs for the dynamic scenes. Then, we apply optimization to reconstruct both depth maps and camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Align3R estimates consistent video depth and camera poses for a monocular video with superior performance than baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text serves as the key control signal in video generation due to its narrative nature. To render text descriptions into video clips, current video diffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited text comprehension. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) showcases the power of decoder-only transformers, which offers three clear benefits for text-to-video (T2V) generation, namely, precise text understanding resulting from the superior scalability, imagination beyond the input text enabled by next token prediction, and flexibility to prioritize user interests through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, the feature distribution gap emerging from the two different text modeling paradigms hinders the direct use of LLMs in established T2V models. This work addresses this challenge with Mimir, an end-to-end training framework featuring a carefully tailored token fuser to harmonize the outputs from text encoders and LLMs. Such a design allows the T2V model to fully leverage learned video priors while capitalizing on the text-related capability of LLMs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mimir in generating high-quality videos with excellent text comprehension, especially when processing short captions and managing shifting motions.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a powerful encoder that transfers CLIP`s capabilities to event-based data, enhancing its utility and expanding its applicability across diverse domains. While large-scale datasets have significantly advanced image-based models, the scarcity of comprehensive event datasets has limited performance potential in event modality. To address this challenge, we adapt CLIP`s architecture to align event embeddings with image embeddings, supporting zero-shot learning and preserving text alignment while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our encoder achieves strong performance in object recognition, with competitive results in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, it generalizes effectively to events extracted from video data without requiring additional training, highlighting its versatility. Additionally, we integrate this encoder within a cross-modality framework that facilitates interaction across five modalities-Image, Event, Text, Sound, and Depth-expanding the possibilities for cross-modal applications. Overall, this work underscores the transformative potential of a robust event encoder, broadening the scope and utility of event-based data across various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanding Diao, Yang Zhao, Yuan Chen, Zhao Zhang, Wei Jia, Ronggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of stereoscopic display technologies, especially glasses-free 3D screens, and virtual reality devices, stereoscopic conversion has become an important task to address the lack of high-quality stereoscopic image and video resources. Current stereoscopic conversion algorithms typically struggle to balance reconstruction performance and inference efficiency. This paper proposes a planar video real-time stereoscopic conversion network based on multi-plane images (MPI), which consists of a detail branch for generating MPI and a depth-semantic branch for perceiving depth information. Unlike models that depend on explicit depth map inputs, the proposed method employs a lightweight depth-semantic branch to extract depth-aware features implicitly. To optimize the lightweight branch, a heavy training but light inference strategy is adopted, which involves designing a coarse-to-fine auxiliary branch that is only used during the training stage. In addition, the proposed method simplifies the MPI rendering process for stereoscopic conversion scenarios to further accelerate the inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance to some state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and support real-time inference at 2K resolution. Compared to the SOTA TMPI algorithm, the proposed method obtains similar subjective quality while achieving over $40\times$ inference acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gangjian Zhang, Nanjie Yao, Shunsi Zhang, Hanfeng Zhao, Guoliang Pang, Jian Shu, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the research task of reconstructing the 3D clothed human body from a monocular image. Due to the inherent ambiguity of single-view input, existing approaches leverage pre-trained SMPL(-X) estimation models or generative models to provide auxiliary information for human reconstruction. However, these methods capture only the general human body geometry and overlook specific geometric details, leading to inaccurate skeleton reconstruction, incorrect joint positions, and unclear cloth wrinkles. In response to these issues, we propose a multi-level geometry learning framework. Technically, we design three key components: skeleton-level enhancement, joint-level augmentation, and wrinkle-level refinement modules. Specifically, we effectively integrate the projected 3D Fourier features into a Gaussian reconstruction model, introduce perturbations to improve joint depth estimation during training, and refine the human coarse wrinkles by resembling the de-noising process of diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two out-of-distribution test sets show the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Hu, Zhen Qi, Jianjun Wei, Jiajing Chen, Runyuan Bao, Xinyu Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized various fields, yet its efficacy is hindered by overfitting and the requirement of extensive annotated data, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios where limited samples are available. This paper introduces a novel approach to few-shot learning by employing a Residual Weight Masking Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (RWM-CGAN) for data augmentation. The proposed model integrates residual units within the generator to enhance network depth and sample quality, coupled with a weight mask regularization technique in the discriminator to improve feature learning from small-sample categories. This method addresses the core issues of robustness and generalization in few-shot learning by providing a controlled and clear augmentation of the sample space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RWM-CGAN not only expands the sample space effectively but also enriches the diversity and quality of generated samples, leading to significant improvements in detection and classification accuracy on public datasets. The paper contributes to the advancement of few-shot learning by offering a practical solution to the challenges posed by data scarcity and the need for rapid generalization to new tasks or categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Guo, Wenkai Huang, Yang Li, Gaolei Li, Hang Zhang, Liwen Hu, Jianhua Li, Tiejun Huang, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive 3D reconstruction performance with explicit scene representations. Given the widespread application of 3DGS in 3D reconstruction and generation tasks, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of 3DGS assets. However, existing copyright protection techniques for 3DGS overlook the usability of 3D assets, posing challenges for practical deployment. Here we describe WaterGS, the first 3DGS watermarking framework that embeds 3D content in 3DGS itself without modifying any attributes of the vanilla 3DGS. To achieve this, we take a deep insight into spherical harmonics (SH) and devise an importance-graded SH coefficient encryption strategy to embed the hidden SH coefficients. Furthermore, we employ a convolutional autoencoder to establish a mapping between the original Gaussian primitives' opacity and the hidden Gaussian primitives' opacity. Extensive experiments indicate that WaterGS significantly outperforms existing 3D steganography techniques, with 5.31% higher scene fidelity and 3X faster rendering speed, while ensuring security, robustness, and user experience.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyoon Jin, Jisu Nam, Jiyoung Kim, Dahyun Chung, Yeong-Seok Kim, Joonhyung Park, Heonjeong Chu, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-based semantic image synthesis aims to generate images aligned with given semantic content while preserving the appearance of an exemplar image. Conventional structure-guidance models, such as ControlNet, are limited in that they cannot directly utilize exemplar images as input, relying instead solely on text prompts to control appearance. Recent tuning-free approaches address this limitation by transferring local appearance from the exemplar image to the synthesized image through implicit cross-image matching in the augmented self-attention mechanism of pre-trained diffusion models. However, these methods face challenges when applied to content-rich scenes with significant geometric deformations, such as driving scenes. In this paper, we propose the Appearance Matching Adapter (AM-Adapter), a learnable framework that enhances cross-image matching within augmented self-attention by incorporating semantic information from segmentation maps. To effectively disentangle generation and matching processes, we adopt a stage-wise training approach. Initially, we train the structure-guidance and generation networks, followed by training the AM-Adapter while keeping the other networks frozen. During inference, we introduce an automated exemplar retrieval method to efficiently select exemplar image-segmentation pairs. Despite utilizing a limited number of learnable parameters, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling in both semantic alignment preservation and local appearance fidelity. Extensive ablation studies further validate our design choices. Code and pre-trained weights will be publicly available.: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/AM-Adapter/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunkai Dang, Min Zhang, Zhengyu Chen, Xinliang Zhang, Zheng Wang, Meijun Sun, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot image classification(FSIC) aims to recognize novel classes given few labeled images from base classes. Recent works have achieved promising classification performance, especially for metric-learning methods, where a measure at only image feature level is usually used. In this paper, we argue that measure at such a level may not be effective enough to generalize from base to novel classes when using only a few images. Instead, a multi-level descriptor of an image is taken for consideration in this paper. We propose a multi-level correlation network (MLCN) for FSIC to tackle this problem by effectively capturing local information. Concretely, we present the self-correlation module and cross-correlation module to learn the semantic correspondence relation of local information based on learned representations. Moreover, we propose a pattern-correlation module to capture the pattern of fine-grained images and find relevant structural patterns between base classes and novel classes. Extensive experiments and analysis show the effectiveness of our proposed method on four widely-used FSIC benchmarks. The code for our approach is available at: https://github.com/Yunkai696/MLCN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning has shown outstanding results in computer vision tasks; healthcare is no exception. However, there is no straightforward way to expose the decision-making process of DL models. Good accuracy is not enough for skin cancer predictions. Understanding the model's behavior is crucial for clinical application and reliable outcomes. In this work, we identify desiderata for explanations in skin-lesion models. We analyzed seven methods, four based on pixel-attribution (Grad-CAM, Score-CAM, LIME, SHAP) and three on high-level concepts (ACE, ICE, CME), for a deep neural network trained on the International Skin Imaging Collaboration Archive. Our findings indicate that while these techniques reveal biases, there is room for improving the comprehensiveness of explanations to achieve transparency in skin-lesion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihan Huang, Long Chan, Jinlong Liu, Wanggui He, Hao Jiang, Mingli Song, Jie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning-free personalized image generation can synthesize customized images without test-time finetuning, attracting wide research interest owing to its high efficiency. Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single training stage with a simple image reconstruction task, and they typically generate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during test-time. To mitigate this problem, inspired by the recent DPO (i.e., direct preference optimization) technique, this work proposes an additional training stage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However, traditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two samples, which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the generated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in some local image patches. To tackle this problem, this work proposes PatchDPO that estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and accordingly trains the model. To this end, PatchDPO first leverages the pre-trained vision model with a proposed self-supervised training method to estimate the patch quality. Next, PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach to train the model with the estimated patch quality, which rewards the image patches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality. Experiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the performance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object personalized image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Fontana, Michael Spratling, Miaojing Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) involves the concurrent training of multiple tasks, offering notable advantages for dense prediction tasks in computer vision. MTL not only reduces training and inference time as opposed to having multiple single-task models, but also enhances task accuracy through the interaction of multiple tasks. However, existing methods face limitations. They often rely on suboptimal cross-task interactions, resulting in task-specific predictions with poor geometric and predictive coherence. In addition, many approaches use inadequate loss weighting strategies, which do not address the inherent variability in task evolution during training. To overcome these challenges, we propose an advanced MTL model specifically designed for dense vision tasks. Our model leverages state-of-the-art vision transformers with task-specific decoders. To enhance cross-task coherence, we introduce a trace-back method that improves both cross-task geometric and predictive features. Furthermore, we present a novel dynamic task balancing approach that projects task losses onto a common scale and prioritizes more challenging tasks during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across two benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Ciampi, Gabriele Lagani, Giuseppe Amato, Fabrizio Falchi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage semi-supervised learning approach for training downsampling-upsampling semantic segmentation architectures. The first stage does not use backpropagation. Rather, it exploits the bio-inspired Hebbian principle "fire together, wire together" as a local learning rule for updating the weights of both convolutional and transpose-convolutional layers, allowing unsupervised discovery of data features. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with standard backpropagation on a small subset of labeled data. We evaluate our methodology through experiments conducted on several widely used biomedical datasets, deeming that this domain is paramount in computer vision and is notably impacted by data scarcity. Results show that our proposed method outperforms SOTA approaches across different levels of label availability. Furthermore, we show that using our unsupervised stage to initialize the SOTA approaches leads to performance improvements.

<p>Abstract: Effective defect detection is critical for ensuring the quality, functionality, and economic value of textile products. However, existing methods face challenges in achieving high accuracy, real-time performance, and efficient global information extraction. To address these issues, we propose Fab-ME, an advanced framework based on YOLOv8s, specifically designed for the accurate detection of 20 fabric defect types. Our contributions include the introduction of the cross-stage partial bottleneck with two convolutions (C2F) vision state-space (C2F-VMamba) module, which integrates visual state-space (VSS) blocks into the YOLOv8s feature fusion network neck, enhancing the capture of intricate details and global context while maintaining high processing speeds. Additionally, we incorporate an enhanced multi-scale channel attention (EMCA) module into the final layer of the feature extraction network, significantly improving sensitivity to small targets. Experimental results on the Tianchi fabric defect detection dataset demonstrate that Fab-ME achieves a 3.3\% improvement in mAP@0.5 compared to the original YOLOv8s, validating its effectiveness for precise and efficient fabric defect detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Vila-Tom\'as, Pablo Hern\'andez-C\'amara, Valero Laparra, Jes\'us Malo</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning models can learn human-like features at earlier levels, which suggests their utility in modeling human vision, few attempts exist to incorporate these features by design. Current approaches mostly optimize all parameters blindly, only constraining minor architectural aspects. This paper demonstrates how parametrizing neural network layers enables more biologically-plausible operations while reducing trainable parameters and improving interpretability. We constrain operations to functional forms present in human vision, optimizing only these functions' parameters rather than all convolutional tensor elements independently. We present two parametric model versions: one with hand-chosen biologically plausible parameters, and another fitted to human perception experimental data. We compare these with a non-parametric version. All models achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with parametric versions showing orders of magnitude parameter reduction for minimal performance loss. The parametric models demonstrate improved interpretability and training behavior. Notably, the model fitted to human perception, despite biological initialization, converges to biologically incorrect results. This raises scientific questions and highlights the need for diverse evaluation methods to measure models' humanness, rather than assuming task performance correlates with human-like behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingfei Deng, Changming Zhao, Zhenbang Du, Kun Xia, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims at training a high-performance model for a target domain using few labeled target data, many unlabeled target data, and plenty of auxiliary data from a source domain. Previous works in SSDA mainly focused on learning transferable representations across domains. However, it is difficult to find a feature space where the source and target domains share the same conditional probability distribution. Additionally, there is no flexible and effective strategy extending existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches to SSDA settings. In order to solve the above two challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, semi-supervised transfer boosting (SS-TrBoosting). Given a well-trained deep learning-based UDA or SSDA model, we use it as the initial model, generate additional base learners by boosting, and then use all of them as an ensemble. More specifically, half of the base learners are generated by supervised domain adaptation, and half by semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, for more efficient data transmission and better data privacy protection, we propose a source data generation approach to extend SS-TrBoosting to semi-supervised source-free domain adaptation (SS-SFDA). Extensive experiments showed that SS-TrBoosting can be applied to a variety of existing UDA, SSDA and SFDA approaches to further improve their performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers are widely used for their ability to capture data relations in sequence processing, with great success for a wide range of static tasks. However, the computational and memory footprint of their main component, i.e., the Scaled Dot-product Attention, is commonly overlooked. This makes their adoption in applications involving stream data processing with constraints in response latency, computational and memory resources infeasible. Some works have proposed methods to lower the computational cost of transformers, i.e. low-rank approximations, sparsity in attention, and efficient formulations for Continual Inference. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation of the Scaled Dot-product Attention based on the Nystr\"om approximation that is suitable for Continual Inference. In experiments on Online Audio Classification and Online Action Detection tasks, the proposed Continual Scaled Dot-product Attention can lower the number of operations by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the original Transformers while retaining the predictive performance of competing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Przewi\k{e}\'zlikowski, Randall Balestriero, Wojciech Jasi\'nski, Marek \'Smieja, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a popular method for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) of visual representations. However, for high-level perception tasks, MIM-pretrained models offer lower out-of-the-box representation quality than the Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) - another prominent SSL paradigm. To understand this performance gap, we analyze the information flow in Vision Transformers (ViT) learned by both approaches. We reveal that whereas JEAs construct their representation on a selected set of relevant image fragments, MIM models aggregate nearly whole image content. Moreover, we demonstrate that MIM-trained ViTs retain valuable information within their patch tokens, which is not effectively captured by the global [cls] token representations. Therefore, selective aggregation of relevant patch tokens, without any fine-tuning, results in consistently higher-quality of MIM representations. To our knowledge, we are the first to highlight the lack of effective representation aggregation as an emergent issue of MIM and propose directions to address it, contributing to future advances in Self-Supervised Learning.</p>

We further allow the user to specify a text prompt to provide additional guidance for the generation. We finetune a pre-trained DiT-based video generator into a material generator, where each material map is treated as a frame in a video sequence.

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aggregates information from multiple sensor sources, achieving superior visual quality and perceptual characteristics compared to any single source, often enhancing downstream tasks. However, current fusion methods for downstream tasks still use predefined fusion objectives that potentially mismatch the downstream tasks, limiting adaptive guidance and reducing model flexibility. To address this, we propose Task-driven Image Fusion (TDFusion), a fusion framework incorporating a learnable fusion loss guided by task loss. Specifically, our fusion loss includes learnable parameters modeled by a neural network called the loss generation module. This module is supervised by the loss of downstream tasks in a meta-learning manner. The learning objective is to minimize the task loss of the fused images, once the fusion module has been optimized by the fusion loss. Iterative updates between the fusion module and the loss module ensure that the fusion network evolves toward minimizing task loss, guiding the fusion process toward the task objectives. TDFusion's training relies solely on the loss of downstream tasks, making it adaptable to any specific task. It can be applied to any architecture of fusion and task networks. Experiments demonstrate TDFusion's performance in both fusion and task-related applications, including four public fusion datasets, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwu Zhong, Zhuoming Liu, Yin Li, Liwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that, our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, under a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code will be available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingdong He, Jinlong Peng, Pengcheng Xu, Boyuan Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Donghao Luo, Yong Liu, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Xiangtai Li, Jiangning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jens Egholm Pedersen, Dimitris Korakovounis, J\"org Conradt</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based vision sensors are appealing because of their time resolution, higher dynamic range, and low-power consumption. They also provide data that is fundamentally different from conventional frame-based cameras: events are sparse, discrete, and require integration in time. Unlike conventional models grounded in established geometric and physical principles, event-based models lack comparable foundations. We introduce a method to generate event-based data under controlled transformations. Specifically, we subject a prototypical object to transformations that change over time to produce carefully curated event videos. We hope this work simplifies studies for geometric approaches in event-based vision. GERD is available at https://github.com/ncskth/gerd</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Sun, Qinwei Lin, Yu Gao, Yujie Zhong, Chengjian Feng, Dengjie Li, Zheng Zhao, Jie Hu, Lin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models (DM) have been extensively utilized in image super-resolution (ISR). Most of the existing methods adopt the denoising loss from DDPMs for model optimization. We posit that introducing reward feedback learning to finetune the existing models can further improve the quality of the generated images. In this paper, we propose a timestep-aware training strategy with reward feedback learning. Specifically, in the initial denoising stages of ISR diffusion, we apply low-frequency constraints to super-resolution (SR) images to maintain structural stability. In the later denoising stages, we use reward feedback learning to improve the perceptual and aesthetic quality of the SR images. In addition, we incorporate Gram-KL regularization to alleviate stylization caused by reward hacking. Our method can be integrated into any diffusion-based ISR model in a plug-and-play manner. Experiments show that ISR diffusion models, when fine-tuned with our method, significantly improve the perceptual and aesthetic quality of SR images, achieving excellent subjective results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikos Efthymiadis, Bill Psomas, Zakaria Laskar, Konstantinos Karantzalos, Yannis Avrithis, Ond\v{r}ej Chum, Giorgos Tolias</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses composed image retrieval in the context of domain conversion, where the content of a query image is retrieved in the domain specified by the query text. We show that a strong vision-language model provides sufficient descriptive power without additional training. The query image is mapped to the text input space using textual inversion. Unlike common practice that invert in the continuous space of text tokens, we use the discrete word space via a nearest-neighbor search in a text vocabulary. With this inversion, the image is softly mapped across the vocabulary and is made more robust using retrieval-based augmentation. Database images are retrieved by a weighted ensemble of text queries combining mapped words with the domain text. Our method outperforms prior art by a large margin on standard and newly introduced benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/NikosEfth/freedom</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Wang, Kai Krajsek, Hanno Scharr</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmentation-based self-supervised learning methods have shown remarkable success in self-supervised visual representation learning, excelling in learning invariant features but often neglecting equivariant ones. This limitation reduces the generalizability of foundation models, particularly for downstream tasks requiring equivariance. We propose integrating an image reconstruction task as an auxiliary component in augmentation-based self-supervised learning algorithms to facilitate equivariant feature learning without additional parameters. Our method implements a cross-attention mechanism to blend features learned from two augmented views, subsequently reconstructing one of them. This approach is adaptable to various datasets and augmented-pair based learning methods. We evaluate its effectiveness on learning equivariant features through multiple linear regression tasks and downstream applications on both artificial (3DIEBench) and natural (ImageNet) datasets. Results consistently demonstrate significant improvements over standard augmentation-based self-supervised learning methods and state-of-the-art approaches, particularly excelling in scenarios involving combined augmentations. Our method enhances the learning of both invariant and equivariant features, leading to more robust and generalizable visual representations for computer vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Jun Lin, Wenqing Wang, Yujiao Shi, Akhil Perincherry, Ankit Vora, Hongdong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for cross-view synthesis aimed at generating plausible ground-level images from corresponding satellite imagery or vice versa. We refer to these tasks as satellite-to-ground (Sat2Grd) and ground-to-satellite (Grd2Sat) synthesis, respectively. Unlike previous works that typically focus on one-to-one generation, producing a single output image from a single input image, our approach acknowledges the inherent one-to-many nature of the problem. This recognition stems from the challenges posed by differences in illumination, weather conditions, and occlusions between the two views. To effectively model this uncertainty, we leverage recent advancements in diffusion models. Specifically, we exploit random Gaussian noise to represent the diverse possibilities learnt from the target view data. We introduce a Geometry-guided Cross-view Condition (GCC) strategy to establish explicit geometric correspondences between satellite and street-view features. This enables us to resolve the geometry ambiguity introduced by camera pose between image pairs, boosting the performance of cross-view image synthesis. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on three benchmark cross-view datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed geometry-guided cross-view condition over baseline methods, including recent state-of-the-art approaches in cross-view image synthesis. Our method generates images of higher quality, fidelity, and diversity than other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangbo Zhao, Yizeng Han, Jiasheng Tang, Zhikai Li, Yibing Song, Kai Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success across various multi-modal tasks, yet large VLMs encounter significant efficiency challenges due to processing numerous visual tokens. A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from specific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across all layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains comparable performance under aggressive pruning. However, the attention maps from all layers requires a full inference pass, which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM, suggesting an efficient alternative. Based on these findings, we introduce a \textbf{training-free} method, \underline{\textbf{S}}mall VLM \underline{\textbf{G}}uidance for accelerating \underline{\textbf{L}}arge VLMs (\textbf{SGL}). Specifically, we employ the attention map aggregated from a small VLM to guide visual token pruning in a large VLM. Additionally, an early exiting mechanism is developed to fully use the small VLM's predictions, dynamically invoking the larger VLM only when necessary, yielding a superior trade-off between accuracy and computation. Extensive evaluations across 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SGL, achieving up to 91\% pruning ratio for visual tokens while retaining competitive performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03342">UniVAD: A Training-free Unified Model for Few-shot Visual Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Gu, Bingke Zhu, Guibo Zhu, Yingying Chen, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal samples in images that deviate from normal patterns, covering multiple domains, including industrial, logical, and medical fields. Due to the domain gaps between these fields, existing VAD methods are typically tailored to each domain, with specialized detection techniques and model architectures that are difficult to generalize across different domains. Moreover, even within the same domain, current VAD approaches often follow a "one-category-one-model" paradigm, requiring large amounts of normal samples to train class-specific models, resulting in poor generalizability and hindering unified evaluation across domains. To address this issue, we propose a generalized few-shot VAD method, UniVAD, capable of detecting anomalies across various domains, such as industrial, logical, and medical anomalies, with a training-free unified model. UniVAD only needs few normal samples as references during testing to detect anomalies in previously unseen objects, without training on the specific domain. Specifically, UniVAD employs a Contextual Component Clustering ($C^3$) module based on clustering and vision foundation models to segment components within the image accurately, and leverages Component-Aware Patch Matching (CAPM) and Graph-Enhanced Component Modeling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies at different semantic levels, which are aggregated to produce the final detection result. We conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning industrial, logical, and medical fields, and the results demonstrate that UniVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomaly detection tasks across multiple domains, outperforming domain-specific anomaly detection models. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Huang, Wei Xiong, He Zhang, Chaoqi Chen, Jianzhuang Liu, Mingfu Yan, Shifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Building on the success of diffusion models in image generation and editing, video editing has recently gained substantial attention. However, maintaining temporal consistency and motion alignment still remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework designed to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on either target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The core of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a pretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing process. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO features to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve high-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the potential of DINO to contribute to video editing. For precise subject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a pretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), effectively registering the target subject's identity.

However, ethical, legal, and technical challenges due to the sensitive nature of face data and biases in real-world training datasets hinder their development. Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities, but fairness problems remain. Using the existing DCFace SOTA framework, we introduce a new controlled generation pipeline that improves fairness. Through classical fairness metrics and a proposed in-depth statistical analysis based on logit models and ANOVA, we show that our generation pipeline improves fairness more than other bias mitigation approaches while slightly improving raw performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqin Zhang, Qingkui Chen, Chen Huang, Zhengjie Zhang, Meiling Chen, Zhibing Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most data-driven models for medical image analysis rely on universal augmentations to improve performance. Experimental evidence has confirmed their effectiveness, but the unclear mechanism underlying them poses a barrier to the widespread acceptance and trust in such methods within the medical community. We revisit and acknowledge the unique characteristics of medical images apart from traditional digital images, and consequently, proposed a medical-specific augmentation algorithm that is more elastic and aligns well with radiology scan procedure. The method performs piecewise affine with sinusoidal distorted ray according to radius on polar coordinates, thus simulating uncertain postures of human lying flat on the scanning table. Our method could generate human visceral distribution without affecting the fundamental relative position on axial plane. Two non-adaptive algorithms, namely Meta-based Scan Table Removal and Similarity-Guided Parameter Search, are introduced to bolster robustness of our augmentation method. Experiments show our method improves accuracy across multiple famous segmentation frameworks without requiring more data samples. Our preview code is available in: https://github.com/MGAMZ/PSBPD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved outstanding results in the field of image super-resolution. These methods typically inject low-resolution (LR) images via ControlNet.In this paper, we first explore the temporal dynamics of information infusion through ControlNet, revealing that the input from LR images predominantly influences the initial stages of the denoising process. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel timestep-aware diffusion model that adaptively integrates features from both ControlNet and the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD). Our method enhances the transmission of LR information in the early stages of diffusion to guarantee image fidelity and stimulates the generation ability of the SD model itself more in the later stages to enhance the detail of generated images. To train this method, we propose a timestep-aware training strategy that adopts distinct losses at varying timesteps and acts on disparate modules. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code: https://github.com/SleepyLin/TASR</p>

<p>Abstract: Applying style transfer to a full 3D environment is a challenging task that has seen many developments since the advent of neural rendering. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently pushed further many limits of neural rendering in terms of training speed and reconstruction quality. This work introduces SGSST: Scaling Gaussian Splatting Style Transfer, an optimization-based method to apply style transfer to pretrained 3DGS scenes. We demonstrate that a new multiscale loss based on global neural statistics, that we name SOS for Simultaneously Optimized Scales, enables style transfer to ultra-high resolution 3D scenes. Not only SGSST pioneers 3D scene style transfer at such high image resolutions, it also produces superior visual quality as assessed by thorough qualitative, quantitative and perceptual comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Talegaonkar, Yash Belhe, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Nicholas Antipa</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic view synthesis at high inference speeds. However, its splatting-based rendering model makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical accuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points. Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> August Leander H{\o}eg, Sophia W. Bardenfleth, Hans Martin Kjer, Tim B. Dyrby, Vedrana Andersen Dahl, Anders Dahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Until now, it has been difficult for volumetric super-resolution to utilize the recent advances in transformer-based models seen in 2D super-resolution. The memory required for self-attention in 3D volumes limits the receptive field. Therefore, long-range interactions are not used in 3D to the extent done in 2D and the strength of transformers is not realized. We propose a multi-scale transformer-based model based on hierarchical attention blocks combined with carrier tokens at multiple scales to overcome this. Here information from larger regions at coarse resolution is sequentially carried on to finer-resolution regions to predict the super-resolved image. Using transformer layers at each resolution, our coarse-to-fine modeling limits the number of tokens at each scale and enables attention over larger regions than what has previously been possible. We experimentally compare our method, MTVNet, against state-of-the-art volumetric super-resolution models on five 3D datasets demonstrating the advantage of an increased receptive field. This advantage is especially pronounced for images that are larger than what is seen in popularly used 3D datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/AugustHoeg/MTVNet</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03400">Implicit Priors Editing in Stable Diffusion via Targeted Token Adjustment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng He, Chao Zhang, Zhixue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit assumptions and priors are often necessary in text-to-image generation tasks, especially when textual prompts lack sufficient context. However, these assumptions can sometimes reflect outdated concepts, inaccuracies, or societal bias embedded in the training data. We present Embedding-only Editing (Embedit), a method designed to efficiently adjust implict assumptions and priors in the model without affecting its interpretation of unrelated objects or overall performance. Given a "source" prompt (e.g., "rose") that elicits an implicit assumption (e.g., rose is red) and a "destination" prompt that specifies the desired attribute (e.g., "blue rose"), Embedit fine-tunes only the word token embedding (WTE) of the target object ("rose") to optimize the last hidden state of text encoder in Stable Diffusion, a SOTA text-to-image model. This targeted adjustment prevents unintended effects on other objects in the model's knowledge base, as the WTEs for unrelated objects and the model weights remain unchanged. Consequently, when a prompt does not contain the edited object, all representations, and the model outputs are identical to those of the original, unedited model. Our method is highly efficient, modifying only 768 parameters for Stable Diffusion 1.4 and 2048 for XL in a single edit, matching the WTE dimension of each respective model. This minimal scope, combined with rapid execution, makes Embedit highly practical for real-world applications. Additionally, changes are easily reversible by restoring the original WTE layers. Our experimental results demonstrate that Embedit consistently outperforms previous methods across various models, tasks, and editing scenarios (both single and sequential multiple edits), achieving at least a 6.01% improvement (from 87.17% to 93.18%).</p>

<p>Abstract: Esophageal cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide. It is traditionally treated using open esophagectomy, but in recent years, robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has emerged as a promising alternative. However, robot-assisted surgery can be challenging for novice surgeons, as they often suffer from a loss of spatial orientation. Computer-aided anatomy recognition holds promise for improving surgical navigation, but research in this area remains limited. In this study, we developed a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation in RAMIE, featuring the largest collection of vital anatomical structures and surgical instruments to date. Handling this diverse set of classes presents challenges, including class imbalance and the recognition of complex structures such as nerves. This study aims to understand the challenges and limitations of current state-of-the-art algorithms on this novel dataset and problem. Therefore, we benchmarked eight real-time deep learning models using two pretraining datasets. We assessed both traditional and attention-based networks, hypothesizing that attention-based networks better capture global patterns and address challenges such as occlusion caused by blood or other tissues. The benchmark includes our RAMIE dataset and the publicly available CholecSeg8k dataset, enabling a thorough assessment of surgical segmentation tasks. Our findings indicate that pretraining on ADE20k, a dataset for semantic segmentation, is more effective than pretraining on ImageNet. Furthermore, attention-based models outperform traditional convolutional neural networks, with SegNeXt and Mask2Former achieving higher Dice scores, and Mask2Former additionally excelling in average symmetric surface distance.</p>

By introducing a skeleton guide layer following the existing ray conditioning normalization (RCN) layer, our approach enhances pose accuracy and multi-view consistency. The skeleton guide layer provides detailed structural information for the generative model, improving the quality of synthesized views. Experimental results demonstrate that our skeleton-guided method significantly enhances consistency and accuracy across diverse object categories within the Objaverse dataset. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art NVS techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively, without relying on explicit 3D representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Asperti, Ali Aydogdu, Emanuela Clementi, Angelo Greco, Lorenzo Mentaschi, Fabio Merizzi, Pietro Miraglio, Paolo Oddo, Nadia Pinardi, Alessandro Testa</p>
<p>Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding Earth's oceans and climate, significantly influencing weather patterns, ocean currents, marine ecosystem health, and the global energy balance. Large-scale SST monitoring relies on satellite infrared radiation detection, but cloud cover presents a major challenge, creating extensive observational gaps and hampering our ability to fully capture large-scale ocean temperature patterns. Efforts to address these gaps in existing L4 datasets have been made, but they often exhibit notable local and seasonal biases, compromising data reliability and accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we employed deep neural networks to reconstruct cloud-covered portions of satellite imagery while preserving the integrity of observed values in cloud-free areas, using MODIS satellite derived observations of SST. Our best-performing architecture showed significant skill improvements over established methodologies, achieving substantial reductions in error metrics when benchmarked against widely used approaches and datasets. These results underscore the potential of advanced AI techniques to enhance the completeness of satellite observations in Earth-science remote sensing, providing more accurate and reliable datasets for environmental assessments, data-driven model training, climate research, and seamless integration into model data assimilation workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanting Zhang, Haodong Xiang, Zhichao Liao, Xiansong Lai, Xinghui Li, Long Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The reconstruction of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of spatial structures and the prevalence of textureless regions. Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have improved novel view synthesis with accelerated processing but have yet to deliver comparable performance in surface reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce 2DGS-Room, a novel method leveraging 2D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we employ a seed-guided mechanism to control the distribution of 2D Gaussians, with the density of seed points dynamically optimized through adaptive growth and pruning mechanisms. To further improve geometric accuracy, we incorporate monocular depth and normal priors to provide constraints for details and textureless regions respectively. Additionally, multi-view consistency constraints are employed to mitigate artifacts and further enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor scene reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Li, Ziya Zhou, Zhiqiang Wang, Wei Xue, Wenhan Luo, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly enhanced talking face video generation, yet singing video generation remains underexplored. The differences between human talking and singing limit the performance of existing talking face video generation models when applied to singing. The fundamental differences between talking and singing-specifically in audio characteristics and behavioral expressions-limit the effectiveness of existing models. We observe that the differences between singing and talking audios manifest in terms of frequency and amplitude. To address this, we have designed a multi-scale spectral module to help the model learn singing patterns in the spectral domain. Additionally, we develop a spectral-filtering module that aids the model in learning the human behaviors associated with singing audio. These two modules are integrated into the diffusion model to enhance singing video generation performance, resulting in our proposed model, SINGER. Furthermore, the lack of high-quality real-world singing face videos has hindered the development of the singing video generation community. To address this gap, we have collected an in-the-wild audio-visual singing dataset to facilitate research in this area. Our experiments demonstrate that SINGER is capable of generating vivid singing videos and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Stracke, Stefan Andreas Baumann, Kolja Bauer, Frank Fundel, Bj\"orn Ommer</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal features from large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have recently been established as powerful semantic descriptors for a wide range of downstream tasks. Works that use these features generally need to add noise to images before passing them through the model to obtain the semantic features, as the models do not offer the most useful features when given images with little to no noise. We show that this noise has a critical impact on the usefulness of these features that cannot be remedied by ensembling with different random noises. We address this issue by introducing a lightweight, unsupervised fine-tuning method that enables diffusion backbones to provide high-quality, noise-free semantic features. We show that these features readily outperform previous diffusion features by a wide margin in a wide variety of extraction setups and downstream tasks, offering better performance than even ensemble-based methods at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Tan, Rui Yu, Yujun Shen, Nan Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents PlanarSplatting, an ultra-fast and accurate surface reconstruction approach for multiview indoor images. We take the 3D planes as the main objective due to their compactness and structural expressiveness in indoor scenes, and develop an explicit optimization framework that learns to fit the expected surface of indoor scenes by splatting the 3D planes into 2.5D depth and normal maps. As our PlanarSplatting operates directly on the 3D plane primitives, it eliminates the dependencies on 2D/3D plane detection and plane matching and tracking for planar surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the essential merits of plane-based representation plus CUDA-based implementation of planar splatting functions, PlanarSplatting reconstructs an indoor scene in 3 minutes while having significantly better geometric accuracy. Thanks to our ultra-fast reconstruction speed, the largest quantitative evaluation on the ScanNet and ScanNet++ datasets over hundreds of scenes clearly demonstrated the advantages of our method. We believe that our accurate and ultrafast planar surface reconstruction method will be applied in the structured data curation for surface reconstruction in the future. The code of our CUDA implementation will be publicly available. Project page: https://icetttb.github.io/PlanarSplatting/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dario Serez, Marco Cristani, Alessio Del Bue, Vittorio Murino, Pietro Morerio</p>
<p>Abstract: Attackers can deliberately perturb classifiers' input with subtle noise, altering final predictions. Among proposed countermeasures, adversarial purification employs generative networks to preprocess input images, filtering out adversarial noise. In this study, we propose specific generators, defined Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs), for adversarial purification. These models possess multiple latent variables that naturally disentangle coarse from fine features. Taking advantage of these properties, we autoencode images to maintain class-relevant information, while discarding and re-sampling any detail, including adversarial noise. The procedure is completely training-free, exploring the generalization abilities of pre-trained MLVGMs on the adversarial purification downstream task. Despite the lack of large models, trained on billions of samples, we show that smaller MLVGMs are already competitive with traditional methods, and can be used as foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neale Ratzlaff, Man Luo, Xin Su, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal models typically combine a powerful large language model (LLM) with a vision encoder and are then trained on multimodal data via instruction tuning. While this process adapts LLMs to multimodal settings, it remains unclear whether this adaptation compromises their original language reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of multimodal instruction tuning on language reasoning performance. We focus on LLaVA, a leading multimodal framework that integrates LLMs such as Vicuna or Mistral with the CLIP vision encoder. We compare the performance of the original LLMs with their multimodal-adapted counterparts across eight language reasoning tasks. Our experiments yield several key insights. First, the impact of multimodal learning varies between Vicuna and Mistral: we observe a degradation in language reasoning for Mistral but improvements for Vicuna across most tasks. Second, while multimodal instruction learning consistently degrades performance on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K), it enhances performance on commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Finally, we demonstrate that a training-free model merging technique can effectively mitigate the language reasoning degradation observed in multimodal-adapted Mistral and even improve performance on visual tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Measure Anything, a comprehensive vision-based framework for dimensional measurement of objects with circular cross-sections, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our approach estimates key geometric features -- including diameter, length, and volume -- for rod-like geometries with varying curvature and general objects with constant skeleton slope. The framework integrates segmentation, mask processing, skeleton construction, and 2D-3D transformation, packaged in a user-friendly interface. We validate our framework by estimating the diameters of Canola stems -- collected from agricultural fields in North Dakota -- which are thin and non-uniform, posing challenges for existing methods. Measuring its diameters is critical, as it is a phenotypic traits that correlates with the health and yield of Canola crops. This application also exemplifies the potential of Measure Anything, where integrating intelligent models -- such as keypoint detection -- extends its scalability to fully automate the measurement process for high-throughput applications. Furthermore, we showcase its versatility in robotic grasping, leveraging extracted geometric features to identify optimal grasp points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen Li, Jiaxin Huang, Runnan Chen, Yunlong Che, Yandong Guo, Tongliang Liu, Fakhri Karray, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic urban scenes presents significant challenges due to their intrinsic geometric structures and spatiotemporal dynamics. Existing methods that attempt to model dynamic urban scenes without leveraging priors on potentially moving regions often produce suboptimal results. Meanwhile, approaches based on manual 3D annotations yield improved reconstruction quality but are impractical due to labor-intensive labeling. In this paper, we revisit the potential of 2D semantic maps for classifying dynamic and static Gaussians and integrating spatial and temporal dimensions for urban scene representation. We introduce Urban4D, a novel framework that employs a semantic-guided decomposition strategy inspired by advances in deep 2D semantic map generation. Our approach distinguishes potentially dynamic objects through reliable semantic Gaussians. To explicitly model dynamic objects, we propose an intuitive and effective 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) representation that aggregates temporal information through learnable time embeddings for each Gaussian, predicting their deformations at desired timestamps using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). For more accurate static reconstruction, we also design a k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based consistency regularization to handle the ground surface due to its low-texture characteristic. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Urban4D not only achieves comparable or better quality than previous state-of-the-art methods but also effectively captures dynamic objects while maintaining high visual fidelity for static elements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abu Yusuf, Md Rezaul Karim Khan, Partha Pratim Saha, Mohammed Mahbubur Rahaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Considerable study has already been conducted regarding autonomous driving in modern era. An autonomous driving system must be extremely good at detecting objects surrounding the car to ensure safety. In this paper, classification, and estimation of an object's (pedestrian) position (concerning an ego 3D coordinate system) are studied and the distance between the ego vehicle and the object in the context of autonomous driving is measured. To classify the object, faster Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) with inception v2 is utilized. First, a network is trained with customized dataset to estimate the reference position of objects as well as the distance from the vehicle. From camera calibration to computing the distance, cutting-edge technologies of computer vision algorithms in a series of processes are applied to generate a 3D reference point of the region of interest. The foremost step in this process is generating a disparity map using the concept of stereo vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gait recognition is a significant biometric technique for person identification, particularly in scenarios where other physiological biometrics are impractical or ineffective. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with gait recognition and present a novel approach to improve its accuracy and reliability.

Extensive experiments were conducted on large-scale cross-view datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high recognition accuracy compared to other models. The model demonstrated accuracies of 95.7%, 94.44%, 87.71%, and 86.6% on CASIA-B, SZU RGB-D, OU-MVLP, and Gait3D datasets respectively. The results highlight the potential applications of the proposed method in various practical domains, indicating its significant contribution to the field of gait recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic correspondence, the task of determining relationships between different parts of images, underpins various applications including 3D reconstruction, image-to-image translation, object tracking, and visual place recognition. Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been applied to 3D LiDAR scene completion due to their strong training stability and high completion quality. However, the slow sampling speed limits the practical application of diffusion-based scene completion models since autonomous vehicles require an efficient perception of surrounding environments. This paper proposes a novel distillation method tailored for 3D LiDAR scene completion models, dubbed $\textbf{ScoreLiDAR}$, which achieves efficient yet high-quality scene completion. ScoreLiDAR enables the distilled model to sample in significantly fewer steps after distillation. To improve completion quality, we also introduce a novel $\textbf{Structural Loss}$, which encourages the distilled model to capture the geometric structure of the 3D LiDAR scene. The loss contains a scene-wise term constraining the holistic structure and a point-wise term constraining the key landmark points and their relative configuration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScoreLiDAR significantly accelerates the completion time from 30.55 to 5.37 seconds per frame ($>$5$\times$) on SemanticKITTI and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR scene completion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingen Li, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yaowei Li, Jiale Xu, Xiaoyu Li, Wenbo Hu, Weihao Cheng, Jinwei Gu, Tianfan Xue, Ying Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved novel view synthesis (NVS) from multi-view data. However, existing methods depend on external multi-view alignment processes, such as explicit pose estimation or pre-reconstruction, which limits their flexibility and accessibility, especially when alignment is unstable due to insufficient overlap or occlusions between views. In this paper, we propose NVComposer, a novel approach that eliminates the need for explicit external alignment. NVComposer enables the generative model to implicitly infer spatial and geometric relationships between multiple conditional views by introducing two key components: 1) an image-pose dual-stream diffusion model that simultaneously generates target novel views and condition camera poses, and 2) a geometry-aware feature alignment module that distills geometric priors from dense stereo models during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NVComposer achieves state-of-the-art performance in generative multi-view NVS tasks, removing the reliance on external alignment and thus improving model accessibility. Our approach shows substantial improvements in synthesis quality as the number of unposed input views increases, highlighting its potential for more flexible and accessible generative NVS systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a dense depth estimation approach from light-field (LF) images that is able to compensate for strong rolling shutter (RS) effects. Our method estimates RS compensated views and dense RS compensated disparity maps. We present a two-stage method based on a 2D Gaussians Splatting that allows for a ``render and compare" strategy with a point cloud formulation. In the first stage, a subset of sub-aperture images is used to estimate an RS agnostic 3D shape that is related to the scene target shape ``up to a motion". In the second stage, the deformation of the 3D shape is computed by estimating an admissible camera motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of this approach through several experiments conducted for different scenes and types of motions. Due to lack of suitable datasets for evaluation, we also present a new carefully designed synthetic dataset of RS LF images.

<p>Abstract: Generating multi-view videos for autonomous driving training has recently gained much attention, with the challenge of addressing both cross-view and cross-frame consistency. Existing methods typically apply decoupled attention mechanisms for spatial, temporal, and view dimensions. However, these approaches often struggle to maintain consistency across dimensions, particularly when handling fast-moving objects that appear at different times and viewpoints. In this paper, we present CogDriving, a novel network designed for synthesizing high-quality multi-view driving videos. CogDriving leverages a Diffusion Transformer architecture with holistic-4D attention modules, enabling simultaneous associations across the spatial, temporal, and viewpoint dimensions. We also propose a lightweight controller tailored for CogDriving, i.e., Micro-Controller, which uses only 1.1% of the parameters of the standard ControlNet, enabling precise control over Bird's-Eye-View layouts. To enhance the generation of object instances crucial for autonomous driving, we propose a re-weighted learning objective, dynamically adjusting the learning weights for object instances during training. CogDriving demonstrates strong performance on the nuScenes validation set, achieving an FVD score of 37.8, highlighting its ability to generate realistic driving videos.

Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahtab Bigverdi, Zelun Luo, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ethan Shen, Dongping Chen, Linda G. Shapiro, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</p>

Imagine360 learns fine-grained spherical visual and motion patterns from limited $360^\circ$ video data with several key designs. 1) Firstly we adopt the dual-branch design, including a perspective and a panorama video denoising branch to provide local and global constraints for $360^\circ$ video generation, with motion module and spatial LoRA layers fine-tuned on extended web $360^\circ$ videos. 2) Additionally, an antipodal mask is devised to capture long-range motion dependencies, enhancing the reversed camera motion between antipodal pixels across hemispheres. 3) To handle diverse perspective video inputs, we propose elevation-aware designs that adapt to varying video masking due to changing elevations across frames. Extensive experiments show Imagine360 achieves superior graphics quality and motion coherence among state-of-the-art $360^\circ$ video generation methods. We believe Imagine360 holds promise for advancing personalized, immersive $360^\circ$ video creation.</p>

<p>Abstract: PaliGemma 2 is an upgrade of the PaliGemma open Vision-Language Model (VLM) based on the Gemma 2 family of language models. We combine the SigLIP-So400m vision encoder that was also used by PaliGemma with the whole range of Gemma 2 models, from the 2B one all the way up to the 27B model. We train these models at three resolutions (224px, 448px, and 896px) in multiple stages to equip them with broad knowledge for transfer via fine-tuning. The resulting family of base models covering different model sizes and resolutions allows us to investigate factors impacting transfer performance (such as learning rate) and to analyze the interplay between the type of task, model size, and resolution. We further increase the number and breadth of transfer tasks beyond the scope of PaliGemma including different OCR-related tasks such as table structure recognition, molecular structure recognition, music score recognition, as well as long fine-grained captioning and radiography report generation, on which PaliGemma 2 obtains state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehuan Huang, Yuan-Chen Guo, Xingqiao An, Yunhan Yang, Yangguang Li, Zi-Xin Zou, Ding Liang, Xihui Liu, Yan-Pei Cao, Lu Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MIDI, a novel paradigm for compositional 3D scene generation from a single image. Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xiao, Sanghwan Kim, Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu, Zeynep Akata, Stephan Alaniz</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP has shown impressive results in aligning images and texts at scale. However, its ability to capture detailed visual features remains limited because CLIP matches images and texts at a global level. To address this issue, we propose FLAIR, Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations, an approach that utilizes long and detailed image descriptions to learn localized image embeddings. By sampling diverse sub-captions that describe fine-grained details about an image, we train our vision-language model to produce not only global embeddings but also text-specific image representations. Our model introduces text-conditioned attention pooling on top of local image tokens to produce fine-grained image representations that excel at retrieving detailed image content. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on both, existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks, as well as, our newly introduced fine-grained retrieval task which evaluates vision-language models' ability to retrieve partial image content. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAIR trained on 30M image-text pairs in capturing fine-grained visual information, including zero-shot semantic segmentation, outperforming models trained on billions of pairs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wujian Peng, Lingchen Meng, Yitong Chen, Yiweng Xie, Yang Liu, Tao Gui, Hang Xu, Xipeng Qiu, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant breakthroughs with the advancement of instruction tuning. However, while existing models can understand images and videos at a holistic level, they still struggle with instance-level understanding that requires a more nuanced comprehension and alignment. Instance-level understanding is crucial, as it focuses on the specific elements that we are most interested in. Excitingly, existing works find that the state-of-the-art LMMs exhibit strong instance understanding capabilities when provided with explicit visual cues. Motivated by this, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline assisted by GPT-4o to extract instance-level information from images and videos through explicit visual prompting for instance guidance. Building upon this pipeline, we proposed Inst-IT, a solution to enhance LMMs in Instance understanding via explicit visual prompt Instruction Tuning. Inst-IT consists of a benchmark to diagnose multimodal instance-level understanding, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a continuous instruction-tuning training paradigm to effectively enhance spatial-temporal instance understanding capabilities of existing LMMs. Experimental results show that, with the boost of Inst-IT, our models not only achieve outstanding performance on Inst-IT Bench but also demonstrate significant improvements across various generic image and video understanding benchmarks. This highlights that our dataset not only boosts instance-level understanding but also strengthens the overall capabilities of generic image and video comprehension.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose FreeSim, a camera simulation method for autonomous driving. FreeSim emphasizes high-quality rendering from viewpoints beyond the recorded ego trajectories. In such viewpoints, previous methods have unacceptable degradation because the training data of these viewpoints is unavailable. To address such data scarcity, we first propose a generative enhancement model with a matched data construction strategy. The resulting model can generate high-quality images in a viewpoint slightly deviated from the recorded trajectories, conditioned on the degraded rendering of this viewpoint. We then propose a progressive reconstruction strategy, which progressively adds generated images of unrecorded views into the reconstruction process, starting from slightly off-trajectory viewpoints and moving progressively farther away. With this progressive generation-reconstruction pipeline, FreeSim supports high-quality off-trajectory view synthesis under large deviations of more than 3 meters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotics, autonomous driving, augmented reality, and many embodied computer vision applications must quickly react to user-defined events unfolding in real time. We address this setting by proposing a novel task for multimodal video understanding-Streaming Detection of Queried Event Start (SDQES). The goal of SDQES is to identify the beginning of a complex event as described by a natural language query, with high accuracy and low latency. We introduce a new benchmark based on the Ego4D dataset, as well as new task-specific metrics to study streaming multimodal detection of diverse events in an egocentric video setting. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in NLP and for video tasks, we propose adapter-based baselines that enable image-to-video transfer learning, allowing for efficient online video modeling. We evaluate three vision-language backbones and three adapter architectures on both short-clip and untrimmed video settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03570">Sparse-view Pose Estimation and Reconstruction via Analysis by Generative Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitao Zhao, Shubham Tulsiani</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring the 3D structure underlying a set of multi-view images typically requires solving two co-dependent tasks -- accurate 3D reconstruction requires precise camera poses, and predicting camera poses relies on (implicitly or explicitly) modeling the underlying 3D. The classical framework of analysis by synthesis casts this inference as a joint optimization seeking to explain the observed pixels, and recent instantiations learn expressive 3D representations (e.g., Neural Fields) with gradient-descent-based pose refinement of initial pose estimates. However, given a sparse set of observed views, the observations may not provide sufficient direct evidence to obtain complete and accurate 3D. Moreover, large errors in pose estimation may not be easily corrected and can further degrade the inferred 3D. To allow robust 3D reconstruction and pose estimation in this challenging setup, we propose SparseAGS, a method that adapts this analysis-by-synthesis approach by: a) including novel-view-synthesis-based generative priors in conjunction with photometric objectives to improve the quality of the inferred 3D, and b) explicitly reasoning about outliers and using a discrete search with a continuous optimization-based strategy to correct them. We validate our framework across real-world and synthetic datasets in combination with several off-the-shelf pose estimation systems as initialization. We find that it significantly improves the base systems' pose accuracy while yielding high-quality 3D reconstructions that outperform the results from current multi-view reconstruction baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingjie Song, Xin Huang, Ruting Xie, Xue Wang, Qing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Style3D, a novel approach for generating stylized 3D objects from a content image and a style image. Unlike most previous methods that require case- or style-specific training, Style3D supports instant 3D object stylization. Our key insight is that 3D object stylization can be decomposed into two interconnected processes: multi-view dual-feature alignment and sparse-view spatial reconstruction. We introduce MultiFusion Attention, an attention-guided technique to achieve multi-view stylization from the content-style pair. Specifically, the query features from the content image preserve geometric consistency across multiple views, while the key and value features from the style image are used to guide the stylistic transfer. This dual-feature alignment ensures that spatial coherence and stylistic fidelity are maintained across multi-view images. Finally, a large 3D reconstruction model is introduced to generate coherent stylized 3D objects. By establishing an interplay between structural and stylistic features across multiple views, our approach enables a holistic 3D stylization process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Style3D offers a more flexible and scalable solution for generating style-consistent 3D assets, surpassing existing methods in both computational efficiency and visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Bar, Gaoyue Zhou, Danny Tran, Trevor Darrell, Yann LeCun</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The segmentation of histological images is critical for various biomedical applications, yet the lack of annotated data presents a significant challenge. We propose a microscopy pseudo labeling pipeline utilizing unsupervised image translation to address this issue. Our method generates pseudo labels by translating between labeled and unlabeled domains without requiring prior annotation in the target domain. We evaluate two pseudo labeling strategies across three image domains increasingly dissimilar from the labeled data, demonstrating their effectiveness. Notably, our method achieves a mean Dice score of $0.736 \pm 0.005$ on a SEM dataset using the tutoring path, which involves training a segmentation model on synthetic data created by translating the labeled dataset (TEM) to the target modality (SEM). This approach aims to accelerate the annotation process by providing high-quality pseudo labels as a starting point for manual refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salman Mohamadi, Gianfranco Doretto, Donald A. Adjeroh</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks consist of pretext task, and loss function aiming to learn useful general features from unlabeled data. The basic idea of most SSL baselines revolves around enforcing the invariance to a variety of data augmentations via the loss function. However, one main issue is that, inattentive or deterministic enforcement of the invariance to any kind of data augmentation is generally not only inefficient, but also potentially detrimental to performance on the downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the issue from the viewpoint of uncertainty in invariance representation. Uncertainty representation is fairly under-explored in the design of SSL architectures as well as loss functions. We incorporate uncertainty representation in both loss function as well as architecture design aiming for more data-dependent invariance enforcement. The former is represented in the form of data-derived uncertainty in SSL loss function resulting in a generative-discriminative loss function. The latter is achieved by feeding slightly different distorted versions of samples to the ensemble aiming for learning better and more robust representation. Specifically, building upon the recent methods that use hard and soft whitening (a.k.a redundancy reduction), we introduce a new approach GUESS, a pseudo-whitening framework, composed of controlled uncertainty injection, a new architecture, and a new loss function. We include detailed results and ablation analysis establishing GUESS as a new baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of deep learning methods in solving computer vision problems, such as image classification, object detection, scene understanding, image segmentation, etc., has paved the way for their application in biomedical imaging. One such application is in the field of CT image denoising, whereby deep learning methods are proposed to recover denoised images from noisy images acquired at low radiation. Outputs derived from applying deep learning denoising algorithms may appear clean and visually pleasing; however, the underlying diagnostic image quality may not be on par with their normal-dose CT counterparts. In this work, we assessed the image quality of deep learning denoising algorithms by making use of visual perception- and data fidelity-based task-agnostic metrics (like the PSNR and the SSIM) - commonly used in the computer vision - and a task-based detectability assessment (the LCD) - extensively used in the CT imaging. When compared against normal-dose CT images, the deep learning denoisers outperformed low-dose CT based on metrics like the PSNR (by 2.4 to 3.8 dB) and SSIM (by 0.05 to 0.11). However, based on the LCD performance, the detectability using quarter-dose denoised outputs was inferior to that obtained using normal-dose CT scans.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots operating in indoor industrial environments require a localization system that is reliable and robust. While Visual Odometry (VO) can offer a reasonable estimation of the robot's state, traditional VO methods encounter challenges when confronted with dynamic objects in the scene. Alternatively, an upward-facing camera can be utilized to track the robot's movement relative to the ceiling, which represents a static and consistent space. We introduce in this paper Ceiling-DSO, a ceiling-vision system based on Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO). Unlike other ceiling-vision systems, Ceiling-DSO takes advantage of the versatile formulation of DSO, avoiding assumptions about observable shapes or landmarks on the ceiling. This approach ensures the method's applicability to various ceiling types. Since no publicly available dataset for ceiling-vision exists, we created a custom dataset in a real-world scenario and employed it to evaluate our approach. By adjusting DSO parameters, we identified the optimal fit for online pose estimation, resulting in acceptable error rates compared to ground truth. We provide in this paper a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Wu, Huai Yu, Shu Han, Xi-Meng Cai, Ming-Feng Wang, Wen Yang, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of large-scale point cloud registration, designing a compact symbolic representation is crucial for efficiently processing vast amounts of data, ensuring registration robustness against significant viewpoint variations and occlusions. This paper introduces a novel point cloud registration method, i.e., QuadricsReg, which leverages concise quadrics primitives to represent scenes and utilizes their geometric characteristics to establish correspondences for 6-DoF transformation estimation. As a symbolic feature, the quadric representation fully captures the primary geometric characteristics of scenes, which can efficiently handle the complexity of large-scale point clouds. The intrinsic characteristics of quadrics, such as types and scales, are employed to initialize correspondences. Then we build a multi-level compatibility graph set to find the correspondences using the maximum clique on the geometric consistency between quadrics. Finally, we estimate the 6-DoF transformation using the quadric correspondences, which is further optimized based on the quadric degeneracy-aware distance in a factor graph, ensuring high registration accuracy and robustness against degenerate structures. We test on 5 public datasets and the self-collected heterogeneous dataset across different LiDAR sensors and robot platforms. The exceptional registration success rates and minimal registration errors demonstrate the effectiveness of QuadricsReg in large-scale point cloud registration scenarios. Furthermore, the real-world registration testing on our self-collected heterogeneous dataset shows the robustness and generalization ability of QuadricsReg on different LiDAR sensors and robot platforms. The codes and demos will be released at \url{https://levenberg.github.io/QuadricsReg}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a technology that reconstructs cross-sectional images using X-ray images taken from multiple directions. In CT, hundreds of X-ray images acquired as the X-ray source and detector rotate around a central axis, are used for precise reconstruction. In security baggage inspection, X-ray imaging is also widely used; however, unlike the rotating systems in medical CT, stationary X-ray systems are more common, and publicly available reconstructed data are limited. This makes it challenging to obtain large-scale 3D labeled data and voxel representations essential for training. To address these limitations, our study presents a calibration and reconstruction method using an unaligned sparse multi-view X-ray baggage dataset, which has extensive 2D labeling. Our approach integrates multi-spectral neural attenuation field reconstruction with Linear pushbroom (LPB) camera model pose optimization, enhancing rendering consistency for novel views through color coding network. Our method aims to improve generalization within the security baggage inspection domain, where generalization is particularly challenging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Dong, Jintao Cheng, Jin Wu, Chengxi Zhang, Shunyi Zhao, Xiaoyu Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the fifth-generation (5G) era, eliminating communication interference sources is crucial for maintaining network performance. Interference often originates from unauthorized or malfunctioning antennas, and radio monitoring agencies must address numerous sources of such antennas annually. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data transmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI) mode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to detect antenna interference sources for UAVs. The system adopts an optimized edge-cloud collaboration (ECC+) mode, combining a keyframe selection algorithm (KSA), focusing on reducing end-to-end latency (E2EL) and ensuring reliable data transmission, which aligns with the core principles of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). At the core of our approach is an end-to-end antenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, including a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3 million parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs. On the COCO dataset, EdgeAnt achieves 38.9% mAP with 5.4 GFLOPs. We deployed EdgeAnt on Jetson Xavier NX (TRT) and Raspberry Pi 4B (NCNN), achieving real-time inference speeds of 21.1 (1088) and 4.8 (640) frames per second (FPS), respectively. Compared with CO mode, the ECC+ mode reduces E2EL by 88.9%, increases accuracy by 28.2%. Additionally, the system offers excellent scalability for coordinated multiple UAVs inspections.

<p>Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer whose early-stage diagnosis is a common challenge, mainly due to the manual assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images, which is a time-consuming process and may lead to variability in decision-making. For accurate detection of HCC, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based architecture that uses transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and a classifier made up of a sequence of fully connected layers. This study uses a publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC)database (n=491) for model development and database of Kasturba Gandhi Medical College (KMC), India for validation. The pre-processing step involves patch extraction, colour normalization, and augmentation that results in 3920 patches for the TCGA dataset. The developed hybrid deep neural network consisting of a CNN-based pre-trained feature extractor and a customized artificial neural network-based classifier is trained using five-fold cross-validation. For this study, eight different state-of-the-art models are trained and tested as feature extractors for the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model with ResNet50-based feature extractor provided the sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively on the TCGA database. On the KMC database, EfficientNetb3 resulted in the optimal choice of the feature extractor giving sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 96.97, 98.85, 96.71, 96.71, and 0.99, respectively. The proposed hybrid models showed improvement in accuracy of 2% and 4% over the pre-trained models in TCGA-LIHC and KMC databases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assistive technology can be leveraged by blind people when searching for objects in their daily lives. We created ObjectFinder, an open-vocabulary interactive object-search prototype, which combines object detection with scene description and navigation. It enables blind persons to detect and navigate to objects of their choice. Our approach used co-design for the development of the prototype. We further conducted need-finding interviews to better understand challenges in object search, followed by a study with the ObjectFinder prototype in a laboratory setting simulating a living room and an office, with eight blind users. Additionally, we compared the prototype with BeMyEyes and Lookout for object search. We found that most participants felt more independent with ObjectFinder and preferred it over the baselines when deployed on more efficient hardware, as it enhances mental mapping and allows for active target definition. Moreover, we identified factors for future directions for the development of object-search systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saksham Sharma, Akshit Raizada, Suresh Sundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous off-road navigation is required for applications in agriculture, construction, search and rescue and defence. Traditional on-road autonomous methods struggle with dynamic terrains, leading to poor vehicle control on off-road. Recent deep-learning models have used perception sensors along with kinesthetic feedback for navigation on such terrains. However, this approach has out-of-domain uncertainty. Factors like change in weather and time of day impacts the performance of the model. We propose a multi modal fusion network FuseIsPath capable of using LWIR and RGB images to provide robustness against dynamic weather and light conditions. To aid further works in this domain, we also open-source a day-night dataset with LWIR and RGB images along with pseudo-labels for traversability. In order to co-register the two images we developed a novel method for targetless extrinsic calibration of LWIR, LiDAR and RGB cameras with translation accuracy of 1.7cm and rotation accuracy of 0.827degree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianni Franchi, Dat Nguyen Trong, Nacim Belkhir, Guoxuan Xia, Andrea Pilzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image (T2I) generative models is crucial for understanding model behavior and improving output reliability. In this paper, we are the first to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of T2I models with respect to the prompt. Alongside adapting existing approaches designed to measure uncertainty in the image space, we also introduce Prompt-based UNCertainty Estimation for T2I models (PUNC), a novel method leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to better address uncertainties arising from the semantics of the prompt and generated images. PUNC utilizes a LVLM to caption a generated image, and then compares the caption with the original prompt in the more semantically meaningful text space. PUNC also enables the disentanglement of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via precision and recall, which image-space approaches are unable to do. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUNC outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation techniques across various settings. Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image generation models can be used on various applications including bias detection, copyright protection, and OOD detection. We also introduce a comprehensive dataset of text prompts and generation pairs to foster further research in uncertainty quantification for generative models. Our findings illustrate that PUNC not only achieves competitive performance but also enables novel applications in evaluating and improving the trustworthiness of text-to-image models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the counter-forensic effects of the forthcoming JPEG AI standard based on neural image compression, focusing on two critical areas: deepfake image detection and image splicing localization. Neural image compression leverages advanced neural network algorithms to achieve higher compression rates while maintaining image quality. However, it introduces artifacts that closely resemble those generated by image synthesis techniques and image splicing pipelines, complicating the work of researchers when discriminating pristine from manipulated content. We comprehensively analyze JPEG AI's counter-forensic effects through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art detectors and datasets. Our results demonstrate that an increase in false alarms impairs the performance of leading forensic detectors when analyzing genuine content processed through JPEG AI. By exposing the vulnerabilities of the available forensic tools we aim to raise the urgent need for multimedia forensics researchers to include JPEG AI images in their experimental setups and develop robust forensic techniques to distinguish between neural compression artifacts and actual manipulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Schmidt, Markus Enzweiler, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating outdoor environments with visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems poses significant challenges due to dynamic scenes, lighting variations, and seasonal changes, requiring robust solutions. While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas M\"uller, Denis Lukovnikov, Jonas Thietke, Asja Fischer, Erwin Quiring</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wen, Minjie Zhu, Yichen Zhu, Zhibin Tang, Jinming Li, Zhongyi Zhou, Chengmeng Li, Xiaoyu Liu, Yaxin Peng, Chaomin Shen, Feifei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</p>

In this work, we propose two novel physics-constrained approaches using synthetic quantitative MRI (qMRI) images to enhance the robustness and generalisability of segmentation models. We trained a qMRI estimation model to predict qMRI maps from MPRAGE images, which were used to simulate diverse MRI sequences for segmentation training. A second approach built upon prior work in synthetic data for stroke lesion segmentation, generating qMRI maps from a dataset of tissue labels. The proposed approaches improved over the baseline nnUNet on a variety of out-of-distribution datasets, with the second approach outperforming the prior synthetic data method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, CLIP has emerged as a valuable model for aligning image and text information in multi-modal scenarios. However, researchers have observed limitations in the ability of CLIP's text and image encoders to extract detailed knowledge from caption-image pairs. In response, this paper introduces KKLIP, a novel approach designed to enhance the quality of CLIP by incorporating a new knowledge distillation (KD) method derived from Llama 2. Our method comprises three objectives: Text Embedding Distillation, Concept Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Firstly, Text Embedding Distillation involves training the KKLIP text encoder to emulate the teacher model, Llama 2. Secondly, Concept Learning assigns a soft concept label to each caption-image pair through offline k-means clustering of text information from Llama 2, allowing KKLIP to learn from these soft concept labels. Finally, Contrastive Learning harmonizes text and image embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that KKLIP enhances the quality of both text and image encoders.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a self-supervised feature learning method for hyperspectral image classification. Our method tries to construct two different views of the raw hyperspectral image through a cross-representation learning method. And then to learn semantically consistent representation over the created views by contrastive learning method. Specifically, four cross-channel-prediction based augmentation methods are naturally designed to utilize the high dimension characteristic of hyperspectral data for the view construction. And the better representative features are learned by maximizing mutual information and minimizing conditional entropy across different views from our contrastive network. This 'Cross-View-Predicton' style is straightforward and gets the state-of-the-art performance of unsupervised classification with a simple SVM classifier.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a critical imaging method for capturing and modeling tissue microarchitecture at a millimeter scale. A common practice to model the measured DW-MRI signal is via fiber orientation distribution function (fODF). This function is the essential first step for the downstream tractography and connectivity analyses. With recent advantages in data sharing, large-scale multi-site DW-MRI datasets are being made available for multi-site studies. However, measurement variabilities (e.g., inter- and intra-site variability, hardware performance, and sequence design) are inevitable during the acquisition of DW-MRI. Most existing model-based methods (e.g., constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)) and learning based methods (e.g., deep learning (DL)) do not explicitly consider such variabilities in fODF modeling, which consequently leads to inferior performance on multi-site and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven deep constrained spherical deconvolution method to explicitly constrain the scan-rescan variabilities for a more reproducible and robust estimation of brain microstructure from repeated DW-MRI scans. Specifically, the proposed method introduces a new 3D volumetric scanner-invariant regularization scheme during the fODF estimation. We study the Human Connectome Project (HCP) young adults test-retest group as well as the MASiVar dataset (with inter- and intra-site scan/rescan data). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset is employed for external validation. From the experimental results, the proposed data-driven framework outperforms the existing benchmarks in repeated fODF estimation. The proposed method is assessing the downstream connectivity analysis and shows increased performance in distinguishing subjects with different biomarkers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhou, Yuexing Peng, Junchuan Yu, Daqing Ge, Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As a natural disaster, landslide often brings tremendous losses to human lives, so it urgently demands reliable detection of landslide risks. When detecting relic landslides that present important information for landslide risk warning, problems such as visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great challenges when using remote sensing images. To extract accurate semantic features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature extraction from boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses heterogeneous information in the semantic space from high-resolution remote sensing images and digital elevation model data. For full utilization of precious samples, a global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method is developed, which includes the construction of global queues that store hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder, reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed HPCL-Net is evaluated on the Loess Plateau relic landslide dataset and experimental results verify that the proposed HPCL-Net greatly outperforms existing models, where the mIoU is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, the Landslide IoU is improved from 0.334 to 0.394 and the F1score is enhanced from 0.501 to 0.565.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Fu, Tianrun Chen, Yichong Lu, Xiaowei Zhou, Andreas Geiger, Yiyi Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Training perception systems for self-driving cars requires substantial 2D annotations that are labor-intensive to manual label. While existing datasets provide rich annotations on pre-recorded sequences, they fall short in labeling rarely encountered viewpoints, potentially hampering the generalization ability for perception models. In this paper, we present PanopticNeRF-360, a novel approach that combines coarse 3D annotations with noisy 2D semantic cues to generate high-quality panoptic labels and images from any viewpoint. Our key insight lies in exploiting the complementarity of 3D and 2D priors to mutually enhance geometry and semantics. Specifically, we propose to leverage coarse 3D bounding primitives and noisy 2D semantic and instance predictions to guide geometry optimization, by encouraging predicted labels to match panoptic pseudo ground truth. Simultaneously, the improved geometry assists in filtering 3D&2D annotation noise by fusing semantics in 3D space via a learned semantic field. To further enhance appearance, we combine MLP and hash grids to yield hybrid scene features, striking a balance between high-frequency appearance and contiguous semantics. Our experiments demonstrate PanopticNeRF-360's state-of-the-art performance over label transfer methods on the challenging urban scenes of the KITTI-360 dataset. Moreover, PanopticNeRF-360 enables omnidirectional rendering of high-fidelity, multi-view and spatiotemporally consistent appearance, semantic and instance labels.

<p>Abstract: Charts are common in literature across various scientific fields, conveying rich information easily accessible to readers. Current chart-related tasks focus on either chart perception that extracts information from the visual charts, or chart reasoning given the extracted data, e.g. in a tabular form. In this paper, we introduce StructChart, a novel framework that leverages Structured Triplet Representations (STR) to achieve a unified and label-efficient approach to chart perception and reasoning tasks, which is generally applicable to different downstream tasks, beyond the question-answering task as specifically studied in peer works. Specifically, StructChart first reformulates the chart data from the tubular form (linearized CSV) to STR, which can friendlily reduce the task gap between chart perception and reasoning. We then propose a Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM) to quantitatively evaluate the chart perception task performance. To augment the training, we further explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the diversity in both chart visual style and statistical information. Extensive experiments on various chart-related tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of a unified chart perception-reasoning paradigm to push the frontier of chart understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyang Kang, Fengze Han, Abdur R. Fayjie, Patrick Vandewalle, Kourosh Khoshelham, Dong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing methods for depth estimation from a focal stack of images employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using 2D or 3D convolutions over a fixed set of images. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the local properties of CNN kernels, which restricts them to process only focal stacks of fixed number of images during both training and inference. This limitation hampers their ability to generalize to stacks of arbitrary lengths. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel Transformer-based network, FocDepthFormer, which integrates a Transformer with an LSTM module and a CNN decoder. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism allows for the learning of more informative spatial features by implicitly performing non-local cross-referencing. The LSTM module is designed to integrate representations across image stacks of varying lengths. Additionally, we employ multi-scale convolutional kernels in an early-stage encoder to capture low-level features at different degrees of focus/defocus. By incorporating the LSTM, FocDepthFormer can be pre-trained on large-scale monocular RGB depth estimation datasets, improving visual pattern learning and reducing reliance on difficult-to-obtain focal stack data. Extensive experiments on diverse focal stack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generation of high-fidelity view synthesis is essential for robotic navigation and interaction but remains challenging, particularly in indoor environments and real-time scenarios. Existing techniques often require significant computational resources for both training and rendering, and they frequently result in suboptimal 3D representations due to insufficient geometric structuring. To address these limitations, we introduce VoxNeRF, a novel approach that utilizes easy-to-obtain geometry priors to enhance both the quality and efficiency of neural indoor reconstruction and novel view synthesis. We propose an efficient voxel-guided sampling technique that allocates computational resources selectively to the most relevant segments of rays based on a voxel-encoded geometry prior, significantly reducing training and rendering time. Additionally, we incorporate a robust depth loss to improve reconstruction and rendering quality in sparse view settings. Our approach is validated with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ScanNet++ where VoxNeRF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and establishes a new benchmark for indoor immersive interpolation and extrapolation settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We aim to leverage diffusion to address the challenging image matting task. However, the presence of high computational overhead and the inconsistency of noise sampling between the training and inference processes pose significant obstacles to achieving this goal. In this paper, we present DiffMatte, a solution designed to effectively overcome these challenges. First, DiffMatte decouples the decoder from the intricately coupled matting network design, involving only one lightweight decoder in the iterations of the diffusion process. With such a strategy, DiffMatte mitigates the growth of computational overhead as the number of samples increases. Second, we employ a self-aligned training strategy with uniform time intervals, ensuring a consistent noise sampling between training and inference across the entire time domain. Our DiffMatte is designed with flexibility in mind and can seamlessly integrate into various modern matting architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffMatte not only reaches the state-of-the-art level on the Composition-1k test set, surpassing the best methods in the past by 5% and 15% in the SAD metric and MSE metric respectively, but also show stronger generalization ability in other benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Schusterbauer, Ming Gui, Pingchuan Ma, Nick Stracke, Stefan A. Baumann, Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\"orn Ommer</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual synthesis has recently seen significant leaps in performance, largely due to breakthroughs in generative models. Diffusion models have been a key enabler, as they excel in image diversity. However, this comes at the cost of slow training and synthesis, which is only partially alleviated by latent diffusion. To this end, flow matching is an appealing approach due to its complementary characteristics of faster training and inference but less diverse synthesis. We demonstrate that introducing flow matching between a frozen diffusion model and a convolutional decoder enables high-resolution image synthesis at reduced computational cost and model size. A small diffusion model can then effectively provide the necessary visual diversity, while flow matching efficiently enhances resolution and detail by mapping the small to a high-dimensional latent space. These latents are then projected to high-resolution images by the subsequent convolutional decoder of the latent diffusion approach. Combining the diversity of diffusion models, the efficiency of flow matching, and the effectiveness of convolutional decoders, state-of-the-art high-resolution image synthesis is achieved at $1024^2$ pixels with minimal computational cost. Further scaling up our method we can reach resolutions up to $2048^2$ pixels. Importantly, our approach is orthogonal to recent approximation and speed-up strategies for the underlying model, making it easily integrable into the various diffusion model frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan A. Rodriguez, Abhay Puri, Shubham Agarwal, Issam H. Laradji, Pau Rodriguez, Sai Rajeswar, David Vazquez, Christopher Pal, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are vital for modern image rendering due to their scalability and versatility. Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Saadatnejad, Yang Gao, Kaouther Messaoud, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

<p>Abstract: The capability to accurately estimate 3D human poses is crucial for diverse fields such as action recognition, gait recognition, and virtual/augmented reality. However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Yin, Dejia Xu, Zhangyang Wang, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Aided by text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, existing 4D content creation pipelines utilize score distillation sampling to optimize the entire dynamic 3D scene. However, as these pipelines generate 4D content from text or image inputs directly, they are constrained by limited motion capabilities and depend on unreliable prompt engineering for desired results. To address these problems, this work introduces \textbf{4DGen}, a novel framework for grounded 4D content creation. We identify monocular video sequences as a key component in constructing the 4D content. Our pipeline facilitates controllable 4D generation, enabling users to specify the motion via monocular video or adopt image-to-video generations, thus offering superior control over content creation. Furthermore, we construct our 4D representation using dynamic 3D Gaussians, which permits efficient, high-resolution supervision through rendering during training, thereby facilitating high-quality 4D generation. Additionally, we employ spatial-temporal pseudo labels on anchor frames, along with seamless consistency priors implemented through 3D-aware score distillation sampling and smoothness regularizations. Compared to existing video-to-4D baselines, our approach yields superior results in faithfully reconstructing input signals and realistically inferring renderings from novel viewpoints and timesteps. More importantly, compared to previous image-to-4D and text-to-4D works, 4DGen supports grounded generation, offering users enhanced control and improved motion generation capabilities, a feature difficult to achieve with previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Huang, Ze Chen, Zhixing Chen, Erjin Zhou, Xinxing Xu, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Yong Liu, Wangmeng Zuo, Chunmei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes based on very limited training data without forgetting the old ones encountered. Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in this paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP) and propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with Distribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential methods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its adaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific knowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting old knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach. Specifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a feature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is estimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features generated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are sampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the current session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging benchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the superiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL.

<p>Abstract: Visual fine-tuning has garnered significant attention with the rise of pre-trained vision models. The current prevailing method, full fine-tuning, suffers from the issue of knowledge forgetting as it focuses solely on fitting the downstream training set. In this paper, we propose a novel weight rollback-based fine-tuning method called OLOR (One step Learning, One step Review). OLOR combines fine-tuning with optimizers, incorporating a weight rollback term into the weight update term at each step. This ensures consistency in the weight range of upstream and downstream models, effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance. In addition, a layer-wise penalty is presented to employ penalty decay and the diversified decay rate to adjust the weight rollback levels of layers for adapting varying downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, we demonstrate the general applicability and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed OLOR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingfeng He, De Cheng, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) endeavors to retrieve pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. While prior work focuses on establishing cross-modality pseudo-label associations to bridge the modality-gap, they ignore maintaining the instance-level homogeneous and heterogeneous consistency between the feature space and the pseudo-label space, resulting in coarse associations. In response, we introduce a Modality-Unified Label Transfer (MULT) module that simultaneously accounts for both homogeneous and heterogeneous fine-grained instance-level structures, yielding high-quality cross-modality label associations. It models both homogeneous and heterogeneous affinities, leveraging them to quantify the inconsistency between the pseudo-label space and the feature space, subsequently minimizing it. The proposed MULT ensures that the generated pseudo-labels maintain alignment across modalities while upholding structural consistency within intra-modality. Additionally, a straightforward plug-and-play Online Cross-memory Label Refinement (OCLR) module is proposed to further mitigate the side effects of noisy pseudo-labels while simultaneously aligning different modalities, coupled with an Alternative Modality-Invariant Representation Learning (AMIRL) framework. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art USL-VI-ReID methods, highlighting the superiority of our MULT in comparison to other cross-modality association methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olviya Udeshika, Dilshan Lakshitha, Nilantha Premakumara, Surangani Bandara</p>
<p>Abstract: Insomnia is a serious sleep disorder caused by abnormal or excessive neural activity in the brain. An estimated 50 million people worldwide are thought to be affected by this condition, which is the second most severe neurological disease after stroke. In order to ensure a quick recovery, an early and accurate diagnosis of insomnia enables more effective drug and treatment administration. This study proposes a method that uses deep learning to automatically identify patients with insomnia. A set of optimal features are extracted from spectral and temporal domains, including the relative power of {\sigma}, \b{eta} and {\gamma} bands, the total power, the absolute slow wave power, the power ratios of {\theta}, {\alpha}, {\gamma}, \b{eta}, {\theta}/{\alpha}, {\theta}/\b{eta}, {\alpha}/{\gamma} and {\alpha}/\b{eta}, mean, zero crossing rate, mobility, complexity, sleep efficiency and total sleep time, to accurately quantify the differences between insomnia patients and healthy subjects and develops a 1D CNN model for the classification process. With the experiments use Fp2 and C4 EEG channels with 50 insomnia patients and 50 healthy subjects, the proposed model arrives 99.34% accuracy without sleep stage annotation. Using the features only from a single channel, the study proposes a smart solution for insomnia patients which allows machine learning to be to simplify current sleep monitoring hardware and improve in-home ambulatory monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable methods for the neurodevelopmental assessment of infants are essential for early detection of problems that may need prompt interventions. Spontaneous motor activity, or 'kinetics', is shown to provide a powerful surrogate measure of upcoming neurodevelopment. However, its assessment is by and large qualitative and subjective, focusing on visually identified, age-specific gestures. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Age (KA), a novel data-driven metric that quantifies neurodevelopmental maturity by predicting an infant's age based on their movement patterns. KA offers an interpretable and generalizable proxy for motor development. Our method leverages 3D video recordings of infants, processed with pose estimation to extract spatio-temporal series of anatomical landmarks, which are released as a new openly available dataset. These data are modeled using adaptive graph convolutional networks, able to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in infant movements. We also show that our data-driven approach achieves improvement over traditional machine learning baselines based on manually engineered features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Zheng, Anurag Ghosh, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Driving is challenging in conditions like night, rain, and snow. Lack of good labeled datasets has hampered progress in scene understanding under such conditions. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) using large labeled clear-day datasets is a promising research direction in such cases. However, many UDA methods are trained with dominant scene backgrounds (e.g., roads, sky, sidewalks) that appear dramatically different across domains. As a result, they struggle to learn effective features of smaller and often sparse foreground objects (e.g., people, vehicles, signs).
  In this work, we improve UDA training by applying in-place image warping to focus on salient objects. We design instance-level saliency guidance to adaptively oversample object regions and undersample background areas, which reduces adverse effects from background context and enhances backbone feature learning. Our approach improves adaptation across geographies, lighting, and weather conditions, and is agnostic to the task (segmentation, detection), domain adaptation algorithm, saliency guidance, and underlying model architecture. Result highlights include +6.1 mAP50 for BDD100K Clear $\rightarrow$ DENSE Foggy, +3.7 mAP50 for BDD100K Day $\rightarrow$ Night, +3.0 mAP50 for BDD100K Clear $\rightarrow$ Rainy, and +6.3 mIoU for Cityscapes $\rightarrow$ ACDC.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung-Yu Wu, Sheng-Yu Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify the target object within a 3D point cloud scene referred to by a natural language description. Previous works usually require significant data relating to point color and their descriptions to exploit the corresponding complicated verbo-visual relations. In our work, we introduce Vigor, a novel Data-Efficient 3D Visual Grounding framework via Order-aware Referring. Vigor leverages LLM to produce a desirable referential order from the input description for 3D visual grounding. With the proposed stacked object-referring blocks, the predicted anchor objects in the above order allow one to locate the target object progressively without supervision on the identities of anchor objects or exact relations between anchor/target objects. In addition, we present an order-aware warm-up training strategy, which augments referential orders for pre-training the visual grounding framework. This allows us to better capture the complex verbo-visual relations and benefit the desirable data-efficient learning scheme. Experimental results on the NR3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate our superiority in low-resource scenarios. In particular, Vigor surpasses current state-of-the-art frameworks by 9.3% and 7.6% grounding accuracy under 1% data and 10% data settings on the NR3D dataset, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in image matting, existing models heavily depend on manually-drawn trimaps for accurate results in natural image scenarios. However, the process of obtaining trimaps is time-consuming, lacking user-friendliness and device compatibility. This reliance greatly limits the practical application of all trimap-based matting methods. To address this issue, we introduce Click2Trimap, an interactive model capable of predicting high-quality trimaps and alpha mattes with minimal user click inputs. Through analyzing real users' behavioral logic and characteristics of trimaps, we successfully propose a powerful iterative three-class training strategy and a dedicated simulation function, making Click2Trimap exhibit versatility across various scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative assessments on synthetic and real-world matting datasets demonstrate Click2Trimap's superior performance compared to all existing trimap-free matting methods. Especially, in the user study, Click2Trimap achieves high-quality trimap and matting predictions in just an average of 5 seconds per image, demonstrating its substantial practical value in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pin-Hung Kuo, Jinshan Pan, Shao-Yi Chien, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and high-level vision tasks over the past few years. However, the inherent complexity of self-attention is quadratic to the size of the image, leading to unaffordable computational costs for high-resolution vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce Concertormer, featuring a novel Concerto Self-Attention (CSA) mechanism designed for image deblurring. The proposed CSA divides self-attention into two distinct components: one emphasizes generally global and another concentrates on specifically local correspondence. By retaining partial information in additional dimensions independent from the self-attention calculations, our method effectively captures global contextual representations with complexity linear to the image size. To effectively leverage the additional dimensions, we present a Cross-Dimensional Communication module, which linearly combines attention maps and thus enhances expressiveness. Moreover, we amalgamate the two-staged Transformer design into a single stage using the proposed gated-dconv MLP architecture. While our primary objective is single-image motion deblurring, extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in other tasks, such as deraining and deblurring with JPEG artifacts. The source codes and trained models will be made available to the public.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ocean eddies play a significant role both on the sea surface and beneath it, contributing to the sustainability of marine life dependent on oceanic behaviors. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate ocean eddies to monitor changes in the Earth, particularly in the oceans, and their impact on climate. This study aims to pinpoint ocean eddies using AWS cloud services, specifically SageMaker. The primary objective is to detect small-scale (<20km) ocean eddies from satellite remote images and assess the feasibility of utilizing SageMaker, which offers tools for deploying AI applications. Moreover, this research not only explores the deployment of cloud-based services for remote sensing of Earth data but also evaluates several YOLO (You Only Look Once) models using single and multi-GPU-based services in the cloud. Furthermore, this study underscores the potential of these services, their limitations, challenges related to deployment and resource management, and their user-riendliness for Earth science projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Li, Zhilu Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent neural architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial self-attention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-the-art SSID methods.

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning that combines pathological images with genomic data has significantly enhanced the accuracy of survival prediction. Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Gabriel Vinholi, Marco Chini, Anis Amziane, Renato Machado, Danilo Silva, Patrick Matgen</p>
<p>Abstract: Comparing images captured by disparate sensors is a common challenge in remote sensing. This requires image translation -- converting imagery from one sensor domain to another while preserving the original content. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) are potential state-of-the-art solutions for such domain translation due to their proven superiority in multiple image-to-image translation tasks in computer vision. However, these models struggle with reproducing radiometric features of large-scale multi-patch imagery, resulting in inconsistencies across the full image. This renders downstream tasks like Heterogeneous Change Detection impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages denoising diffusion for effective multi-sensor optical image translation over large areas. Our approach super-resolves large-scale low spatial resolution images into high-resolution equivalents from disparate optical sensors, ensuring uniformity across hundreds of patches. Our contributions lie in new forward and reverse diffusion processes that address the challenges of large-scale image translation. Extensive experiments using paired Sentinel-II (10m) and Planet Dove (3m) images demonstrate that our approach provides precise domain adaptation, preserving image content while improving radiometric accuracy and feature representation. A thorough image quality assessment and comparisons with the standard DDIM framework and five other leading methods are presented. We reach a mean Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (mLPIPS) of 0.1884 and a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 45.64, expressively outperforming all compared methods, including DDIM, ShuffleMixer, and SwinIR. The usefulness of our approach is further demonstrated in two Heterogeneous Change Detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Liang, Jiangqi Liu, Sicheng Song, Shiqi Jiang, Shenzhuo Zhang, Yifei Huang, Changbo Wang, Chenhui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-image (T2I) generation have witnessed a shift from adapting text to fixed backgrounds to creating images around text. Traditional approaches are often limited to generate layouts within static images for effective text placement. Our proposed approach, TextCenGen, introduces a dynamic adaptation of the blank region for text-friendly image generation, emphasizing text-centric design and visual harmony generation. Our method employs force-directed attention guidance in T2I models to generate images that strategically reserve whitespace for pre-defined text areas, even for text or icons at the golden ratio. Observing how cross-attention maps affect object placement, we detect and repel conflicting objects using a force-directed graph approach, combined with a Spatial Excluding Cross-Attention Constraint for smooth attention in whitespace areas. As a novel task in graphic design, experiments indicate that TextCenGen outperforms existing methods with more harmonious compositions. Furthermore, our method significantly enhances T2I model outcomes on our specially collected prompt datasets, catering to varied text positions. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TextCenGen in creating more harmonious and integrated text-image compositions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heqi Peng, Yunhong Wang, Ruijie Yang, Beichen Li, Rui Wang, Yuanfang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial example detection, which can be conveniently applied in many scenarios, is important in the area of adversarial defense. Unfortunately, existing detection methods suffer from poor generalization performance, because their training process usually relies on the examples generated from a single known adversarial attack and there exists a large discrepancy between the training and unseen testing adversarial examples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, named Adversarial Example Detection via Principal Adversarial Domain Adaptation (AED-PADA). Specifically, our approach identifies the Principal Adversarial Domains (PADs), i.e., a combination of features of the adversarial examples generated by different attacks, which possesses a large portion of the entire adversarial feature space. Subsequently, we pioneer to exploit Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in adversarial example detection, with PADs as the source domains. Experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our proposed AED-PADA. Note that this superiority is particularly achieved in challenging scenarios characterized by employing the minimal magnitude constraint for the perturbations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) enhances the quality and condition adherence of text-to-image diffusion models. It operates by combining the conditional and unconditional predictions using a fixed weight. However, recent works vary the weights throughout the diffusion process, reporting superior results but without providing any rationale or analysis. By conducting comprehensive experiments, this paper provides insights into CFG weight schedulers. Our findings suggest that simple, monotonically increasing weight schedulers consistently lead to improved performances, requiring merely a single line of code. In addition, more complex parametrized schedulers can be optimized for further improvement, but do not generalize across different models and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Huang, Ze Chen, Bowen Dong, Chaoqi Liang, Erjin Zhou, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Weight Averaging (MWA) is a technique that seeks to enhance model's performance by averaging the weights of multiple trained models. This paper first empirically finds that 1) the vanilla MWA can benefit the class-imbalanced learning, and 2) performing model averaging in the early epochs of training yields a greater performance improvement than doing that in later epochs. Inspired by these two observations, in this paper we propose a novel MWA technique for class-imbalanced learning tasks named Iterative Model Weight Averaging (IMWA). Specifically, IMWA divides the entire training stage into multiple episodes. Within each episode, multiple models are concurrently trained from the same initialized model weight, and subsequently averaged into a singular model. Then, the weight of this average model serves as a fresh initialization for the ensuing episode, thus establishing an iterative learning paradigm. Compared to vanilla MWA, IMWA achieves higher performance improvements with the same computational cost. Moreover, IMWA can further enhance the performance of those methods employing EMA strategy, demonstrating that IMWA and EMA can complement each other. Extensive experiments on various class-imbalanced learning tasks, i.e., class-imbalanced image classification, semi-supervised class-imbalanced image classification and semi-supervised object detection tasks showcase the effectiveness of our IMWA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixian Guo, Ming Liu, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Yiwen Guo, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Mastering a skill generally relies on both hands-on experience from doers and insightful, high-level guidance by mentors. Will this strategy also work well for solving complex non-convex optimization problems? Here, a common gradient-based optimizer acts like a disciplined doer, making locally optimal updates at each step. Large Language Models (LLMs) can also search for better solutions by inferring from natural language instructions, akin to a high-level mentor. In this paper, we show that these two participators are complementary to each other and can effectively collaborate as a combined optimization framework. The collaborative optimization is achieved by alternating between the gradient-based and LLM-based optimizers. We instruct LLMs to generate possibly improved solutions by taking parameter trajectories recorded during the previous stage of gradient-based optimization into account. Inferred results of LLMs are used as restarting points for the next stage of gradient optimization. We verify the effectiveness of this optimization framework on prompt tuning. By leveraging both the locally rigorous gradient-based optimizer and the high-level deductive LLM-based optimizer, the combined optimization method consistently yields improvements over competitive baselines on a variety of tasks. Our results demonstrate the synergistic effect of conventional gradient-based optimization and the inference ability of LLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/guozix/LLM-catalyst.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Jie, Wanquan Liu, Chenqiang Gao, Yihui Wen, Rui He, Weiping Wen, Pengcheng Li, Jintao Zhang, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Lesion segmentation on nasal endoscopic images is challenging due to its complex lesion features. Fully-supervised deep learning methods achieve promising performance with pixel-level annotations but impose a significant annotation burden on experts. Although weakly supervised or semi-supervised methods can reduce the labelling burden, their performance is still limited. Some weakly semi-supervised methods employ a novel annotation strategy that labels weak single-point annotations for the entire training set while providing pixel-level annotations for a small subset of the data. However, the relevant weakly semi-supervised methods only mine the limited information of the point itself, while ignoring its label property and surrounding reliable information. This paper proposes a simple yet efficient weakly semi-supervised method called the Point-Neighborhood Learning (PNL) framework. PNL incorporates the surrounding area of the point, referred to as the point-neighborhood, into the learning process. In PNL, we propose a point-neighborhood supervision loss and a pseudo-label scoring mechanism to explicitly guide the model's training. Meanwhile, we proposed a more reliable data augmentation scheme. The proposed method significantly improves performance without increasing the parameters of the segmentation neural network. Extensive experiments on the NPC-LES dataset demonstrate that PNL outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. Additional validation on colonoscopic polyp segmentation datasets confirms the generalizability of the proposed PNL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Nguyen, Haotian Liu, Yuheng Li, Mu Cai, Utkarsh Ojha, Yong Jae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks (e.g., image captioning, visual question answering). While broad, their knowledge remains generic (e.g., recognizing a dog), and they are unable to handle personalized subjects (e.g., recognizing a user's pet dog). Human reasoning, in contrast, typically operates within the context of specific subjects in our surroundings. For example, one might ask, "What should I buy for my dog's birthday?"; as opposed to a generic inquiry about "What should I buy for a dog's birthday?". Similarly, when looking at a friend's image, the interest lies in seeing their activities (e.g., "my friend is holding a cat"), rather than merely observing generic human actions (e.g., "a man is holding a cat"). In this paper, we introduce the novel task of personalizing LMMs, so that they can have conversations about a specific subject. We propose Yo'LLaVA, which learns to embed a personalized subject into a set of latent tokens given a handful of example images of the subject. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that Yo'LLaVA can learn the concept more efficiently using fewer tokens and more effectively encode the visual attributes compared to strong prompting baselines (e.g., LLaVA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wei, Philipp Lindenberger, Jiri Matas, Daniel Barath</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual place recognition methods struggle with occlusions and partial visual overlaps. We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Cambrian-1, a family of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) designed with a vision-centric approach. While stronger language models can enhance multimodal capabilities, the design choices for vision components are often insufficiently explored and disconnected from visual representation learning research. This gap hinders accurate sensory grounding in real-world scenarios. Our study uses LLMs and visual instruction tuning as an interface to evaluate various visual representations, offering new insights into different models and architectures -- self-supervised, strongly supervised, or combinations thereof -- based on experiments with over 20 vision encoders. We critically examine existing MLLM benchmarks, address the difficulties involved in consolidating and interpreting results from various tasks, and introduce a new vision-centric benchmark, CV-Bench. To further improve visual grounding, we propose the Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA), a dynamic and spatially-aware connector that integrates high-resolution vision features with LLMs while reducing the number of tokens. Additionally, we discuss the curation of high-quality visual instruction-tuning data from publicly available sources, emphasizing the importance of data source balancing and distribution ratio. Collectively, Cambrian-1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also serves as a comprehensive, open cookbook for instruction-tuned MLLMs. We provide model weights, code, supporting tools, datasets, and detailed instruction-tuning and evaluation recipes. We hope our release will inspire and accelerate advancements in multimodal systems and visual representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dewei Zhou, You Li, Fan Ma, Zongxin Yang, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Multi-Instance Generation (MIG) task, which focuses on generating multiple instances within a single image, each accurately placed at predefined positions with attributes such as category, color, and shape, strictly following user specifications. MIG faces three main challenges: avoiding attribute leakage between instances, supporting diverse instance descriptions, and maintaining consistency in iterative generation. To address attribute leakage, we propose the Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC). MIGC generates multiple instances through a divide-and-conquer strategy, breaking down multi-instance shading into single-instance tasks with singular attributes, later integrated. To provide more types of instance descriptions, we developed MIGC++. MIGC++ allows attribute control through text \& images and position control through boxes \& masks. Lastly, we introduced the Consistent-MIG algorithm to enhance the iterative MIG ability of MIGC and MIGC++. This algorithm ensures consistency in unmodified regions during the addition, deletion, or modification of instances, and preserves the identity of instances when their attributes are changed. We introduce the COCO-MIG and Multimodal-MIG benchmarks to evaluate these methods. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks, along with the COCO-Position benchmark and DrawBench, demonstrate that our methods substantially outperform existing techniques, maintaining precise control over aspects including position, attribute, and quantity.

The nets are flexibly composed of overlapping net fragments, which are learned from statistical regularities of sensory input.

However, many issues remain when capturing images in-the-wild under challenging conditions, such as low light, high dynamic range, or rapid motion leading to smeared reconstructions with noticeable artifacts. In this work, we introduce quanta radiance fields, a novel class of neural radiance fields that are trained at the granularity of individual photons using single-photon cameras (SPCs). We develop theory and practical computational techniques for building radiance fields and estimating dense camera poses from unconventional, stochastic, and high-speed binary frame sequences captured by SPCs. We demonstrate, both via simulations and a SPC hardware prototype, high-fidelity reconstructions under high-speed motion, in low light, and for extreme dynamic range settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-Yi Lee, Ching-Chia Kao, Cheng-Han Yeh, Chun-Shien Lu, Chia-Mu Yu, Chu-Song Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable performance with a small fraction of labeled data by leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data from the Internet. However, this large pool of untrusted data is extremely vulnerable to data poisoning, leading to potential backdoor attacks. Current backdoor defenses are not yet effective against such a vulnerability in SSL. In this study, we propose a novel method, Unlabeled Data Purification (UPure), to disrupt the association between trigger patterns and target classes by introducing perturbations in the frequency domain. By leveraging the Rate-Distortion-Perception (RDP) trade-off, we further identify the frequency band, where the perturbations are added, and justify this selection. Notably, UPure purifies poisoned unlabeled data without the need of extra clean labeled data. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and five SSL algorithms demonstrate that UPure effectively reduces the attack success rate from 99.78% to 0% while maintaining model accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Chabot, Nicolas Granger, Guillaume Lapouge</p>
<p>Abstract: The Bird's-eye View (BeV) representation is widely used for 3D perception from multi-view camera images. It allows to merge features from different cameras into a common space, providing a unified representation of the 3D scene. The key component is the view transformer, which transforms image views into the BeV. However, actual view transformer methods based on geometry or cross-attention do not provide a sufficiently detailed representation of the scene, as they use a sub-sampling of the 3D space that is non-optimal for modeling the fine structures of the environment. In this paper, we propose GaussianBeV, a novel method for transforming image features to BeV by finely representing the scene using a set of 3D gaussians located and oriented in 3D space. This representation is then splattered to produce the BeV feature map by adapting recent advances in 3D representation rendering based on gaussian splatting. GaussianBeV is the first approach to use this 3D gaussian modeling and 3D scene rendering process online, i.e. without optimizing it on a specific scene and directly integrated into a single stage model for BeV scene understanding. Experiments show that the proposed representation is highly effective and place GaussianBeV as the new state-of-the-art on the BeV semantic segmentation task on the nuScenes dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gayoon Choi, Taejin Jeong, Sujung Hong, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point-based image editing enables accurate and flexible control through content dragging. However, the role of text embedding during the editing process has not been thoroughly investigated. A significant aspect that remains unexplored is the interaction between text and image embeddings. During the progressive editing in a diffusion model, the text embedding remains constant. As the image embedding increasingly diverges from its initial state, the discrepancy between the image and text embeddings presents a significant challenge. In this study, we found that the text prompt significantly influences the dragging process, particularly in maintaining content integrity and achieving the desired manipulation. Upon these insights, we propose DragText, which optimizes text embedding in conjunction with the dragging process to pair with the modified image embedding. Simultaneously, we regularize the text optimization process to preserve the integrity of the original text prompt. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing diffusion-based drag methods, enhancing performance with only a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Managing chronic wounds is a global challenge that can be alleviated by the adoption of automatic systems for clinical wound assessment from consumer-grade videos. While 2D image analysis approaches are insufficient for handling the 3D features of wounds, existing approaches utilizing 3D reconstruction methods have not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on 3D wound reconstruction from consumer-grade videos. Specifically, we introduce the SALVE dataset, comprising video recordings of realistic wound phantoms captured with different cameras. Using this dataset, we assess the accuracy and precision of state-of-the-art methods for 3D reconstruction, ranging from traditional photogrammetry pipelines to advanced neural rendering approaches. In our experiments, we observe that photogrammetry approaches do not provide smooth surfaces suitable for precise clinical measurements of wounds. Neural rendering approaches show promise in addressing this issue, advancing the use of this technology in wound care practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Jiao, Hongguang Zhu, Jiannan Huang, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei, Humphrey Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ. Code will be available at https://github.com/jiaosiyu1999/MAFT-Plus.git .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Yu, Quanli Liu, Wei Wang, Liyong Zhang, Xiaoguang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, LSS-based multi-view 3D object detection provides an economical and deployment-friendly solution for autonomous driving. However, all the existing LSS-based methods transform multi-view image features into a Cartesian Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) representation, which does not take into account the non-uniform image information distribution and hardly exploits the view symmetry. In this paper, in order to adapt the image information distribution and preserve the view symmetry by regular convolution, we propose to employ the polar BEV representation to substitute the Cartesian BEV representation. To achieve this, we elaborately tailor three modules: a polar view transformer to generate the polar BEV representation, a polar temporal fusion module for fusing historical polar BEV features and a polar detection head to predict the polar-parameterized representation of the object. In addition, we design a 2D auxiliary detection head and a spatial attention enhancement module to improve the quality of feature extraction in perspective view and BEV, respectively. Finally, we integrate the above improvements into a novel multi-view 3D object detector, PolarBEVDet. Experiments on nuScenes show that PolarBEVDet achieves the superior performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhao, Taein Kwon, Paul Streli, Marc Pollefeys, Christian Holz</p>
<p>Abstract: Touch contact and pressure are essential for understanding how humans interact with and manipulate objects, insights which can significantly benefit applications in mixed reality and robotics. However, estimating these interactions from an egocentric camera perspective is challenging, largely due to the lack of comprehensive datasets that provide both accurate hand poses on contacting surfaces and detailed annotations of pressure information. In this paper, we introduce EgoPressure, a novel egocentric dataset that captures detailed touch contact and pressure interactions. EgoPressure provides high-resolution pressure intensity annotations for each contact point and includes accurate hand pose meshes obtained through our proposed multi-view, sequence-based optimization method processing data from an 8-camera capture rig. Our dataset comprises 5 hours of recorded interactions from 21 participants captured simultaneously by one head-mounted and seven stationary Kinect cameras, which acquire RGB images and depth maps at 30 Hz. To support future research and benchmarking, we present several baseline models for estimating applied pressure on external surfaces from RGB images, with and without hand pose information. We further explore the joint estimation of the hand mesh and applied pressure. Our experiments demonstrate that pressure and hand pose are complementary for understanding hand-object interactions. ng of hand-object interactions in AR/VR and robotics research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandika Biswas, Qianyi Wu, Biplab Banerjee, Hamid Rezatofighi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Neural Implicit models for 3D surface reconstruction, handling dynamic environments with interactions between arbitrary rigid, non-rigid, or deformable entities remains challenging. The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improved training efficiency compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaiquan Yang, Yuhao Liu, Jiaying Lin, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the weakly-supervised referring image segmentation (WRIS) problem, and focuses on a challenging setup where target localization is learned directly from image-text pairs. We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object. Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three common benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Kai Qiu, Hao Chen, Jason Kuen, Jiuxiang Gu, Bhiksha Raj, Zhe Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Image tokenizers are crucial for visual generative models, e.g., diffusion models (DMs) and autoregressive (AR) models, as they construct the latent representation for modeling. Increasing token length is a common approach to improve the image reconstruction quality. However, tokenizers with longer token lengths are not guaranteed to achieve better generation quality. There exists a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality regarding token length. In this paper, we investigate the impact of token length on both image reconstruction and generation and provide a flexible solution to the tradeoff. We propose ImageFolder, a semantic tokenizer that provides spatially aligned image tokens that can be folded during autoregressive modeling to improve both generation efficiency and quality. To enhance the representative capability without increasing token length, we leverage dual-branch product quantization to capture different contexts of images. Specifically, semantic regularization is introduced in one branch to encourage compacted semantic information while another branch is designed to capture the remaining pixel-level details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of image generation and shorter token length with ImageFolder tokenizer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time cost is a major challenge in achieving high-quality pluralistic image completion. Recently, the Retentive Network (RetNet) in natural language processing offers a novel approach to this problem with its low-cost inference capabilities. Inspired by this, we apply RetNet to the pluralistic image completion task in computer vision. We present RetCompletion, a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we introduce Bi-RetNet, a bidirectional sequence information fusion model that integrates contextual information from images. During inference, we employ a unidirectional pixel-wise update strategy to restore consistent image structures, achieving both high reconstruction quality and fast inference speed. In the second stage, we use a CNN for low-resolution upsampling to enhance texture details. Experiments on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that our inference speed is 10$\times$ faster than ICT and 15$\times$ faster than RePaint. The proposed RetCompletion significantly improves inference speed and delivers strong performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Xia, Zhengbang Yang, Junbo Zou, Rhys Tracy, Yuqing Wang, Chi Lu, Christopher Lai, Yanjun He, Xun Shao, Zhuoqing Xie, Yuan-fang Wang, Weining Shen, Hanjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 7 proprietary and 6 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs the best with only 52.6% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Cao, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite previous image restoration (IR) methods have often concentrated on isolated degradations, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations involving a complex combination of multiple isolated degradations. However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonjeon Kim, Soohyun Ryu, Yeonsung Jung, Hyunkoo Lee, Joowon Kim, June Yong Yang, Jaeryong Hwang, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly advanced text-guided image editing, which seeks the \textit{preservation} of core elements in the source image while implementing \textit{modifications} based on the target text. However, existing metrics have a \textbf{context-blindness} problem, indiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different pairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or preservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both source image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and attends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose \texttt{AugCLIP}, a \textbf{context-aware} metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification aspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target text. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited image, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align with target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model, \texttt{AugCLIP} augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then calculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and target attributes in CLIP space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, show that \texttt{AugCLIP} aligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards, outperforming existing metrics. The code will be open-sourced for community use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangcong Zheng, Teng Li, Rui Jiang, Yehao Lu, Tao Wu, Xi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have integrated camera pose as a user-friendly and physics-informed condition in video diffusion models, enabling precise camera control. In this paper, we identify one of the key challenges as effectively modeling noisy cross-frame interactions to enhance geometry consistency and camera controllability. We innovatively associate the quality of a condition with its ability to reduce uncertainty and interpret noisy cross-frame features as a form of noisy condition. Recognizing that noisy conditions provide deterministic information while also introducing randomness and potential misguidance due to added noise, we propose applying epipolar attention to only aggregate features along corresponding epipolar lines, thereby accessing an optimal amount of noisy conditions. Additionally, we address scenarios where epipolar lines disappear, commonly caused by rapid camera movements, dynamic objects, or occlusions, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. Furthermore, we develop a more robust and reproducible evaluation pipeline to address the inaccuracies and instabilities of existing camera control metrics. Our method achieves a 25.64% improvement in camera controllability on the RealEstate10K dataset without compromising dynamics or generation quality and demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain images. Training and inference require only 24GB and 12GB of memory, respectively, for 16-frame sequences at 256x256 resolution. We will release all checkpoints, along with training and evaluation code.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaochao Song, Chong Cheng, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel method for efficient and effective 3D surface reconstruction in open scenes. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based works typically require extensive training and rendering time due to the adopted implicit representations. In contrast, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) uses an explicit and discrete representation, hence the reconstructed surface is built by the huge number of Gaussian primitives, which leads to excessive memory consumption and rough surface details in sparse Gaussian areas. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Voxel Kernel Functions (GVKF), which establish a continuous scene representation based on discrete 3DGS through kernel regression. The GVKF integrates fast 3DGS rasterization and highly effective scene implicit representations, achieving high-fidelity open scene surface reconstruction. Experiments on challenging scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GVKF, featuring with high reconstruction quality, real-time rendering speed, significant savings in storage and training memory consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian B. Ch{\l}opowiec, Adam R. Ch{\l}opowiec, Krzysztof Galus, Wojciech Cebula, Martin Tabakov</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited medical imaging datasets challenge deep learning models by increasing risks of overfitting and reduced generalization, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where discriminators may overfit, leading to training divergence. This constraint also impairs classification models trained on small datasets. Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by expanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training a generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation approaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets. The first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical image processing technique, to create realistic image composites that outperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a novel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to synthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images. A comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that effective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for reaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion classification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of 33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on the highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule endoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that an image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to generate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation. Additionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical image processing techniques further improves the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Edge detection has been one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision because of the difficulty in identifying the borders and edges from the real-world images including objects of varying kinds and sizes. Methods based on ensemble learning, which use a combination of backbones and attention modules, outperformed more conventional approaches, such as Sobel and Canny edge detection. Nevertheless, these algorithms are still challenged when faced with complicated scene photos. In addition, the identified edges utilizing the current methods are not refined and often include incorrect edges. In this work, we used a Cascaded Ensemble Canny operator to solve these problems and detect the object edges. The most difficult Fresh and Rotten and Berkeley datasets are used to test the suggested approach in Python. In terms of performance metrics and output picture quality, the acquired results outperform the specified edge detection networks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime Corsetti, Francesco Giuliari, Alice Fasoli, Davide Boscaini, Fabio Poiesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches. Project page: https://jcorsetti.github.io/fun3du</p>

<p>Abstract: Lane detection plays an important role in autonomous driving perception systems. As deep learning algorithms gain popularity, monocular lane detection methods based on them have demonstrated superior performance and emerged as a key research direction in autonomous driving perception. The core designs of these algorithmic frameworks can be summarized as follows: (1) Task paradigm, focusing on lane instance-level discrimination; (2) Lane modeling, representing lanes as a set of learnable parameters in the neural network; (3) Global context supplementation, enhancing inference on the obscure lanes; (4) Perspective effect elimination, providing accurate 3D lanes for downstream applications. From these perspectives, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing methods, encompassing both the increasingly mature 2D lane detection approaches and the developing 3D lane detection works. Besides, this paper compares the performance of mainstream methods on different benchmarks and investigates their inference speed under a unified setting for fair comparison. Moreover, we present some extended works on lane detection, including multi-task perception, video lane detection, online high-definition map construction, and lane topology reasoning, to offer readers a comprehensive roadmap for the evolution of lane detection. Finally, we point out some potential future research directions in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jovana Videnovic, Alan Lukezic, Matej Kristan</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory-based trackers are video object segmentation methods that form the target model by concatenating recently tracked frames into a memory buffer and localize the target by attending the current image to the buffered frames. While already achieving top performance on many benchmarks, it was the recent release of SAM2 that placed memory-based trackers into focus of the visual object tracking community. Nevertheless, modern trackers still struggle in the presence of distractors. We argue that a more sophisticated memory model is required, and propose a new distractor-aware memory model for SAM2 and an introspection-based update strategy that jointly addresses the segmentation accuracy as well as tracking robustness. The resulting tracker is denoted as SAM2.1++. We also propose a new distractor-distilled DiDi dataset to study the distractor problem better. SAM2.1++ outperforms SAM2.1 and related SAM memory extensions on seven benchmarks and sets a solid new state-of-the-art on six of them.</p>

<p>Abstract: To accelerate the inference of heavy Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this study rethinks the current landscape of training-free token reduction research. We regret to find that the critical components of existing methods are tightly intertwined, with their interconnections and effects remaining unclear for comparison, transfer, and expansion. Therefore, we propose a unified ''filter-correlate-compress'' paradigm that decomposes the token reduction into three distinct stages within a pipeline, maintaining consistent design objectives and elements while allowing for unique implementations. We additionally demystify the popular works and subsume them into our paradigm to showcase its universality. Finally, we offer a suite of methods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy throughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10 benchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in FLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art training-free methods.

In contrast, we propose ROSE, a Revolutionary Open-set dense SEgmentation LMM, which enables dense mask prediction and open-category generation through patch-wise perception. Our method treats each image patch as an independent region of interest candidate, enabling the model to predict both dense and sparse masks simultaneously. Additionally, a newly designed instruction-response paradigm takes full advantage of the generation and generalization capabilities of LMMs, achieving category prediction independent of closed-set constraints or predefined categories. To further enhance mask detail and category precision, we introduce a conversation-based refinement paradigm, integrating the prediction result from previous step with textual prompt for revision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROSE achieves competitive performance across various segmentation tasks in a unified framework. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keren Ganon, Morris Alper, Rachel Mikulinsky, Hadar Averbuch-Elor</p>
<p>Abstract: Buildings are a central feature of human culture and are increasingly being analyzed with computational methods. However, recent works on computational building understanding have largely focused on natural imagery of buildings, neglecting the fundamental element defining a building's structure -- its floorplan. Conversely, existing works on floorplan understanding are extremely limited in scope, often focusing on floorplans of a single semantic category and region (e.g. floorplans of apartments from a single country). In this work, we introduce WAFFLE, a novel multimodal floorplan understanding dataset of nearly 20K floorplan images and metadata curated from Internet data spanning diverse building types, locations, and data formats. By using a large language model and multimodal foundation models, we curate and extract semantic information from these images and their accompanying noisy metadata. We show that WAFFLE enables progress on new building understanding tasks, both discriminative and generative, which were not feasible using prior datasets. We will publicly release WAFFLE along with our code and trained models, providing the research community with a new foundation for learning the semantics of buildings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taekyung Ki, Dongchan Min, Gyeongsu Chae</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhong Cao, Chenyang Zhao, Qianyi Zhang, Jinzheng Guang, Yinuo Song Jingtai Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality reconstruction is crucial for dense SLAM. Recent popular approaches utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) techniques for RGB, depth, and semantic reconstruction of scenes. However, these methods often overlook issues of detail and consistency in different parts of the scene. To address this, we propose RGBDS-SLAM, a RGB-D semantic dense SLAM system based on 3D multi-level pyramid gaussian splatting, which enables high-quality dense reconstruction of scene RGB, depth, and semantics.In this system, we introduce a 3D multi-level pyramid gaussian splatting method that restores scene details by extracting multi-level image pyramids for gaussian splatting training, ensuring consistency in RGB, depth, and semantic reconstructions. Additionally, we design a tightly-coupled multi-features reconstruction optimization mechanism, allowing the reconstruction accuracy of RGB, depth, and semantic maps to mutually enhance each other during the rendering optimization process. Extensive quantitative, qualitative, and ablation experiments on the Replica and ScanNet public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuokun Chen, Jinwu Hu, Zeshuai Deng, Yufeng Wang, Bohan Zhuang, Mingkui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) equip language models with visual capabilities by aligning vision encoders with language models. Existing methods to enhance the visual perception of MLLMs often involve designing more powerful vision encoders, which requires exploring a vast design space and re-aligning each potential encoder with the language model, resulting in prohibitively high training costs. In this paper, we introduce VisionFuse, a novel integration framework that efficiently utilizes multiple vision encoders from off-the-shelf MLLMs to enhance visual perception without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different MLLMs tend to focus on distinct regions given the same query and image. Moreover, we find that the feature distributions of vision encoders within an MLLM family, a group of MLLMs sharing the same pretrained LLM, are highly aligned. Building on these insights, VisionFuse enriches the visual context by concatenating the tokens generated by the vision encoders of selected MLLMs within a family. By merging the parameters of language models from these MLLMs, VisionFuse allows a single language model to align with various vision encoders, significantly reducing deployment overhead. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple multimodal benchmarks using various MLLM combinations, demonstrating substantial improvements in multimodal tasks. Notably, when integrating MiniGemini-8B and SLIME-8B, VisionFuse achieves an average performance increase of over 4%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems struggle with complex scenarios due to limited access to diverse, extensive, and out-of-distribution driving data which are critical for safe navigation. World models offer a promising solution to this challenge; however, current driving world models are constrained by short time windows and limited scenario diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfinityDrive, the first driving world model with exceptional generalization capabilities, delivering state-of-the-art performance in high fidelity, consistency, and diversity with minute-scale video generation. InfinityDrive introduces an efficient spatio-temporal co-modeling module paired with an extended temporal training strategy, enabling high-resolution (576$\times$1024) video generation with consistent spatial and temporal coherence. By incorporating memory injection and retention mechanisms alongside an adaptive memory curve loss to minimize cumulative errors, achieving consistent video generation lasting over 1500 frames (more than 2 minutes). Comprehensive experiments in multiple datasets validate InfinityDrive's ability to generate complex and varied scenarios, highlighting its potential as a next-generation driving world model built for the evolving demands of autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liqiong Wang, Teng Jin, Jinyu Yang, Ales Leonardis, Fangyi Wang, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the general domain, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements, yet challenges persist in applying them to specific fields, especially agriculture. As the backbone of the global economy, agriculture confronts numerous challenges, with pests and diseases being particularly concerning due to their complexity, variability, rapid spread, and high resistance. This paper specifically addresses these issues. We construct the first multimodal instruction-following dataset in the agricultural domain, covering over 221 types of pests and diseases with approximately 400,000 data entries. This dataset aims to explore and address the unique challenges in pest and disease control. Based on this dataset, we propose a knowledge-infused training method to develop Agri-LLaVA, an agricultural multimodal conversation system. To accelerate progress in this field and inspire more researchers to engage, we design a diverse and challenging evaluation benchmark for agricultural pests and diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that Agri-LLaVA excels in agricultural multimodal conversation and visual understanding, providing new insights and approaches to address agricultural pests and diseases. By open-sourcing our dataset and model, we aim to promote research and development in LMMs within the agricultural domain and make significant contributions to tackle the challenges of agricultural pests and diseases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yuan, Xijun Wang, Yichen Sheng, Prateek Chennuri, Xingguang Zhang, Stanley Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation today can produce somewhat realistic images from text prompts. However, if one asks the generator to synthesize a particular camera setting such as creating different fields of view using a 24mm lens versus a 70mm lens, the generator will not be able to interpret and generate scene-consistent images. This limitation not only hinders the adoption of generative tools in photography applications but also exemplifies a broader issue of bridging the gap between the data-driven models and the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Generative Photography, a framework designed to control camera intrinsic settings during content generation. The core innovation of this work are the concepts of Dimensionality Lifting and Contrastive Camera Learning, which achieve continuous and consistent transitions for different camera settings. Experimental results show that our method produces significantly more scene-consistent photorealistic images than state-of-the-art models such as Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Hu, Zhang Chen, Zhong Li, Yi Xu, Juyong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, several studies have combined Gaussian Splatting to obtain scene representations with language embeddings for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. While these methods perform well, they essentially require very dense multi-view inputs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose SparseLGS to address the challenge of 3D scene understanding with pose-free and sparse view input images. Our method leverages a learning-based dense stereo model to handle pose-free and sparse inputs, and a three-step region matching approach to address the multi-view semantic inconsistency problem, which is especially important for sparse inputs. Different from directly learning high-dimensional CLIP features, we extract low-dimensional information and build bijections to avoid excessive learning and storage costs. We introduce a reconstruction loss during semantic training to improve Gaussian positions and shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the 3D semantic field problem with sparse pose-free inputs. Experimental results show that SparseLGS achieves comparable quality when reconstructing semantic fields with fewer inputs (3-4 views) compared to previous SOTA methods with dense input. Besides, when using the same sparse input, SparseLGS leads significantly in quality and heavily improves the computation speed (5$\times$speedup).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khawar Islam, Muhammad Zaigham Zaheer, Arif Mahmood, Karthik Nandakumar, Naveed Akhtar</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to enhance generalization in visual classification tasks. However, traditional methods struggle when source and target domains differ, as in domain adaptation, due to their inability to address domain gaps. This paper introduces GenMix, a generalizable prompt-guided generative data augmentation approach that enhances both in-domain and cross-domain image classification. Our technique leverages image editing to generate augmented images based on custom conditional prompts, designed specifically for each problem type. By blending portions of the input image with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal patterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity, improving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models. Efficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight public datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance improvements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and adversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our technique achieves stronger performance across the board.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangtao Wang, Zhen Qin, Yifan Zhang, Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\"orn Ommer, Rania Briq, Stefan Kesselheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision tokenizers have gained a lot of attraction due to their scalability and compactness; previous works depend on old-school GAN-based hyperparameters, biased comparisons, and a lack of comprehensive analysis of the scaling behaviours. To tackle those issues, we introduce Grouped Spherical Quantization (GSQ), featuring spherical codebook initialization and lookup regularization to constrain codebook latent to a spherical surface. Our empirical analysis of image tokenizer training strategies demonstrates that GSQ-GAN achieves superior reconstruction quality over state-of-the-art methods with fewer training iterations, providing a solid foundation for scaling studies. Building on this, we systematically examine the scaling behaviours of GSQ, specifically in latent dimensionality, codebook size, and compression ratios, and their impact on model performance. Our findings reveal distinct behaviours at high and low spatial compression levels, underscoring challenges in representing high-dimensional latent spaces. We show that GSQ can restructure high-dimensional latent into compact, low-dimensional spaces, thus enabling efficient scaling with improved quality. As a result, GSQ-GAN achieves a 16x down-sampling with a reconstruction FID (rFID) of 0.50.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet Nguyen, Anh Nguyen, Trung Dao, Khoi Nguyen, Cuong Pham, Toan Tran, Anh Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches have yielded promising results in distilling multi-step text-to-image diffusion models into one-step ones. The state-of-the-art efficient distillation technique, i.e., SwiftBrushv2 (SBv2), even surpasses the teacher model's performance with limited resources. However, our study reveals its instability when handling different diffusion model backbones due to using a fixed guidance scale within the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) loss. Another weakness of the existing one-step diffusion models is the missing support for negative prompt guidance, which is crucial in practical image generation. This paper presents SNOOPI, a novel framework designed to address these limitations by enhancing the guidance in one-step diffusion models during both training and inference. First, we effectively enhance training stability through Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB), which employs a random-scale classifier-free guidance approach. By varying the guidance scale of both teacher models, we broaden their output distributions, resulting in a more robust VSD loss that enables SB to perform effectively across diverse backbones while maintaining competitive performance. Second, we propose a training-free method called Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA), which integrates negative prompts into one-step diffusion models via cross-attention to suppress undesired elements in generated images. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods significantly improve baseline models across various metrics. Remarkably, we achieve an HPSv2 score of 31.08, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for one-step diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Among numerous studies for driver state detection, wearable physiological measurements offer a practical method for real-time monitoring. However, there are few driver physiological datasets in open-road scenarios, and the existing datasets suffer from issues such as poor signal quality, small sample sizes, and short data collection periods. Therefore, in this paper, a large-scale multimodal driving dataset, OpenDriver, for driver state detection is developed. The OpenDriver encompasses a total of 3,278 driving trips, with a signal collection duration spanning approximately 4,600 hours. Two modalities of driving signals are enrolled in OpenDriver: electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and six-axis motion data of the steering wheel from a motion measurement unit (IMU), which were recorded from 81 drivers and their vehicles. Furthermore, three challenging tasks are involved in our work, namely ECG signal quality assessment, individual biometric identification based on ECG signals, and physiological signal analysis in complex driving environments. To facilitate research in these tasks, corresponding benchmarks have also been introduced. First, a noisy augmentation strategy is applied to generate a larger-scale ECG signal dataset with realistic noise simulation for quality assessment. Second, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework is employed for individual biometric identification. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of drivers' HRV features under different driving conditions is conducted. Each benchmark provides evaluation metrics and reference results. The OpenDriver dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/bdne/OpenDriver.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in Super-Resolution (SR), which focuses on generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input. Deep learning-based methods for super-resolution have been particularly popular and have shown impressive results on various benchmarks. However, research indicates that these methods may not perform as well on strongly compressed videos. We developed a super-resolution benchmark to analyze SR's capacity to upscale compressed videos. Our dataset employed video codecs based on five widely-used compression standards: H.264, H.265, H.266, AV1, and AVS3. We assessed 19 popular SR models using our benchmark and evaluated their ability to restore details and their susceptibility to compression artifacts. To get an accurate perceptual ranking of SR models, we conducted a crowd-sourced side-by-side comparison of their outputs. We found that some SR models, combined with compression, allow us to reduce the video bitrate without significant loss of quality. We also compared a range of image and video quality metrics with subjective scores to evaluate their accuracy on super-resolved compressed videos. The benchmark is publicly available at https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/super-resolution-for-video-compression.html</p>

<p>Abstract: The combination of language processing and image processing keeps attracting increased interest given recent impressive advances that leverage the combined strengths of both domains of research. Among these advances, the task of editing an image on the basis solely of a natural language instruction stands out as a most challenging endeavour. While recent approaches for this task resort, in one way or other, to some form of preliminary preparation, training or fine-tuning, this paper explores a novel approach: We propose a preparation-free method that permits instruction-guided image editing on the fly. This approach is organized along three steps properly orchestrated that resort to image captioning and DDIM inversion, followed by obtaining the edit direction embedding, followed by image editing proper. While dispensing with preliminary preparation, our approach demonstrates to be effective and competitive, outperforming recent, state of the art models for this task when evaluated on the MAGICBRUSH dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Arrhythmias, detectable through electrocardiograms (ECGs), pose significant health risks, underscoring the need for accurate and efficient automated detection techniques. While recent advancements in graph-based methods have demonstrated potential to enhance arrhythmia classification, the challenge lies in effectively representing ECG signals as graphs. This study investigates the use of Visibility Graph (VG) and Vector Visibility Graph (VVG) representations combined with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for arrhythmia classification under the ANSI/AAMI standard, ensuring reproducibility and fair comparison with other techniques. Through extensive experiments on the MIT-BIH dataset, we evaluate various GCN architectures and preprocessing parameters. Our findings demonstrate that VG and VVG mappings enable GCNs to classify arrhythmias directly from raw ECG signals, without the need for preprocessing or noise removal. Notably, VG offers superior computational efficiency, while VVG delivers enhanced classification performance by leveraging additional lead features. The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in several metrics, although challenges persist in classifying the supraventricular ectopic beat (S) class, particularly under the inter-patient paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have made significant progress in accelerating the generation of diffusion models. However, their application to high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation in the latent space remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we identify three key flaws in the current design of Latent Consistency Models (LCMs). We investigate the reasons behind these limitations and propose Phased Consistency Models (PCMs), which generalize the design space and address the identified limitations. Our evaluations demonstrate that PCMs outperform LCMs across 1--16 step generation settings. While PCMs are specifically designed for multi-step refinement, they achieve comparable 1-step generation results to previously state-of-the-art specifically designed 1-step methods. Furthermore, we show the methodology of PCMs is versatile and applicable to video generation, enabling us to train the state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generator.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Li, Feng Li, Yuxi Liu, Runmin Cong, Yao Zhao, Huihui Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recent generative image compression methods have demonstrated impressive potential in optimizing the rate-distortion-perception trade-off, they still face the critical challenge of flexible rate adaption to diverse compression necessities and scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework, termed Control-GIC, the first capable of fine-grained bitrate adaption across a broad spectrum while ensuring high-fidelity and generality compression. Control-GIC is grounded in a VQGAN framework that encodes an image as a sequence of variable-length codes (i.e. VQ-indices), which can be losslessly compressed and exhibits a direct positive correlation with the bitrates. Drawing inspiration from the classical coding principle, we correlate the information density of local image patches with their granular representations. Hence, we can flexibly determine a proper allocation of granularity for the patches to achieve dynamic adjustment for VQ-indices, resulting in desirable compression rates. We further develop a probabilistic conditional decoder capable of retrieving historic encoded multi-granularity representations according to transmitted codes, and then reconstruct hierarchical granular features in the formalization of conditional probability, enabling more informative aggregation to improve reconstruction realism. Our experiments show that Control-GIC allows highly flexible and controllable bitrate adaption where the results demonstrate its superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eui Jun Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Huije Lee, Youngwoo Yoon, Jong C. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the challenges associated with the use of glosses in both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhosein Toosi, Sara Harsini, Fran\c{c}ois B\'enard, Carlos Uribe, Arman Rahmim</p>
<p>Abstract: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging provides a tremendously exciting frontier in visualization of prostate cancer (PCa) metastatic lesions. However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahrokh Hamidi</p>
<p>Abstract: The reconstructed images from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data suffer from multiplicative noise as well as low contrast level. These two factors impact the quality of the SAR images significantly and prevent any attempt to extract valuable information from the processed data. The necessity for mitigating these effects in the field of SAR imaging is of high importance. Therefore, in this paper, we address the aforementioned issues and propose a technique to handle these shortcomings simultaneously. In fact, we combine the de-noising and contrast enhancement processes into a unified algorithm. The image enhancement is performed based on the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique.
  The verification of the proposed algorithm is performed by experimental results based on the data that has been collected from the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite which operates in strip-map mode.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahan Tu, Rui Hu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination poses a persistent challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating hallucinations are generally static, which may overlook the potential risk of data contamination. To address this issue, we propose ODE, an open-set, dynamic protocol designed to evaluate object hallucinations in MLLMs at both the existence and attribute levels. ODE employs a graph-based structure to represent real-world object concepts, their attributes, and the distributional associations between them. This structure facilitates the extraction of concept combinations based on diverse distributional criteria, generating varied samples for structured queries that evaluate hallucinations in both generative and discriminative tasks. Through the generation of new samples, dynamic concept combinations, and varied distribution frequencies, ODE mitigates the risk of data contamination and broadens the scope of evaluation. This protocol is applicable to both general and specialized scenarios, including those with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol, revealing that MLLMs exhibit higher hallucination rates when evaluated with ODE-generated samples, which indicates potential data contamination. Furthermore, these generated samples aid in analyzing hallucination patterns and fine-tuning models, offering an effective approach to mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohwi Kim, Tae-Kyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution methods are increasingly becoming popular for both real-world and face-specific tasks. Many existing approaches, however, rely on simplistic degradation models, which limits their ability to handle complex and unknown degradation patterns effectively. While diffusion-based super-resolution techniques have recently shown impressive results, they are still constrained by the need for numerous inference steps. To address this, we propose TDDSR, an efficient single-step diffusion-based super-resolution method. Our method, distilled from a pre-trained teacher model and based on a diffusion network, performs super-resolution in a single step. It integrates a learnable diffusion-based downsampler to capture diverse degradation patterns and employs two discriminators, one for high-resolution and one for low-resolution images, to enhance the overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness across real-world and face-specific SR tasks, achieving performance beyond other state-of-the-art models and comparable to previous diffusion methods with multiple sampling steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yun Wang, Zhengyang Geng, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast, consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID 1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a methodology that exploits large and diverse data sets to accurately estimate the ambient medium's Green's functions in strongly scattering media. Given these estimates, obtained with and without the use of neural networks, excellent imaging results are achieved, with a resolution that is better than that of a homogeneous medium. This phenomenon, also known as super-resolution, occurs because the ambient scattering medium effectively enhances the physical imaging aperture.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03752">Deferred Poisoning: Making the Model More Vulnerable via Hessian Singularization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao He, Jinyu Tian, Xianwei Zheng, Li Dong, Yuanman Li, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are very vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Cuong Nguyen, Kevin Wells, Thanh-Toan Do, David Rosewarne, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-AI cooperative classification (HAI-CC) approaches aim to develop hybrid intelligent systems that enhance decision-making in various high-stakes real-world scenarios by leveraging both human expertise and AI capabilities. Current HAI-CC methods primarily focus on learning-to-defer (L2D), where decisions are deferred to human experts, and learning-to-complement (L2C), where AI and human experts make predictions cooperatively. However, a notable research gap remains in effectively exploring both L2D and L2C under diverse expert knowledge to improve decision-making, particularly when constrained by the cooperation cost required to achieve a target probability for AI-only selection (i.e., coverage). In this paper, we address this research gap by proposing the Coverage-constrained Learning to Defer and Complement with Specific Experts (CL2DC) method. CL2DC makes final decisions through either AI prediction alone or by deferring to or complementing a specific expert, depending on the input data. Furthermore, we propose a coverage-constrained optimisation to control the cooperation cost, ensuring it approximates a target probability for AI-only selection. This approach enables an effective assessment of system performance within a specified budget. Also, CL2DC is designed to address scenarios where training sets contain multiple noisy-label annotations without any clean-label references. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CL2DC achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art HAI-CC methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samiha Islam, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Shahran Rahman Alve, Md. Mejbah Ullah Chowdhury, Faija Islam Oishe</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of the present study is to analyze an application of deep learning models in order to augment the diagnostic performance of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with a longitudinal cohort study using the Histopathological Imaging Database for oral cancer analysis. The dataset consisted of 5192 images (2435 Normal and 2511 OSCC), which were allocated between training, testing, and validation sets with an estimated ratio repartition of about 52% for the OSCC group, and still, our performance measure was validated on a combination set that contains almost equal number of sample in this use case as entire database have been divided into half using stratified splitting technique based again near binary proportion but total distribution was around even. We selected four deep-learning architectures for evaluation in the present study: ResNet101, DenseNet121, VGG16, and EfficientnetB3. EfficientNetB3 was found to be the best, with an accuracy of 98.33% and F1 score (0.9844), and it took remarkably less computing power in comparison with other models. The subsequent one was DenseNet121, with 90.24% accuracy and an F1 score of 90.45%. Moreover, we employed the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to clarify why EfficientNetB3 made certain decisions with its predictions to improve the explainability and trustworthiness of results. This work provides evidence for the possible superior diagnosis in OSCC activated from the EfficientNetB3 model with the explanation of AI techniques such as LIME and paves an important groundwork to build on towards clinical usage.</p>
