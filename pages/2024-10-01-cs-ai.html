<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Gimenez-Abalos, Sergio Alvarez-Napagao, Adrian Tormos, Ulises Cort\'es, Javier V\'azquez-Salceda</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents are a special kind of AI-based software in that they interact in complex environments and have increased potential for emergent behaviour. Explaining such emergent behaviour is key to deploying trustworthy AI, but the increasing complexity and opaque nature of many agent implementations makes this hard. In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Graphical Model along with a pipeline for designing such model -- by which the behaviour of an agent can be deliberated about -- and for computing a robust numerical value for the intentions the agent has at any moment. We contribute measurements that evaluate the interpretability and reliability of explanations provided, and enables explainability questions such as `what do you want to do now?' (e.g. deliver soup) `how do you plan to do it?' (e.g. returning a plan that considers its skills and the world), and `why would you take this action at this state?' (e.g. explaining how that furthers or hinders its own goals). This model can be constructed by taking partial observations of the agent's actions and world states, and we provide an iterative workflow for increasing the proposed measurements through better design and/or pointing out irrational agent behaviour.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harald Ruess</p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that relative importance and its equitable attribution in terms of Shapley-Owen effects is an appropriate one, and, if we accept a small number of reasonable imperatives for equitable attribution, the only way to measure fairness. On the other hand, the computation of Shapley-Owen effects can be very demanding. Our main technical result is a spectral decomposition of the Shapley-Owen effects, which decomposes the computation of these indices into a model-specific and a model-independent part. The model-independent part is precomputed once and for all, and the model-specific computation of Shapley-Owen effects is expressed analytically in terms of the coefficients of the model's \emph{polynomial chaos expansion} (PCE), which can now be reused to compute different Shapley-Owen effects. We also propose an algorithm for computing precise and sparse truncations of the PCE of the model and the spectral decomposition of the Shapley-Owen effects, together with upper bounds on the accumulated approximation errors. The approximations of both the PCE and the Shapley-Owen effects converge to their true values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Mazzoni, Roberto Pellungrini, Riccardo Guidotti</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce BRIDGET, a novel human-in-the-loop system for hybrid decision-making, aiding the user to label records from an un-labeled dataset, attempting to ``bridge the gap'' between the two most popular Hybrid Decision-Making paradigms: those featuring the human in a leading position, and the other with a machine making most of the decisions. BRIDGET understands when either a machine or a human user should be in charge, dynamically switching between two statuses. In the different statuses, BRIDGET still fosters the human-AI interaction, either having a machine learning model assuming skeptical stances towards the user and offering them suggestions, or towards itself and calling the user back. We believe our proposal lays the groundwork for future synergistic systems involving a human and a machine decision-makers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongrong Li, Yunlei Su, Chenyuan Zhu, Wufan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban Building Exteriors are increasingly important in urban analytics, driven by advancements in Street View Imagery and its integration with urban research. Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful tools for urban annotation, enabling deeper insights into urban environments. However, challenges remain in creating accurate and detailed urban building exterior databases, identifying critical indicators for energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and human-centric design, and systematically organizing these indicators. To address these challenges, we propose BuildingView, a novel approach that integrates high-resolution visual data from Google Street View with spatial information from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. This research improves the accuracy of urban building exterior data, identifies key sustainability and design indicators, and develops a framework for their extraction and categorization. Our methodology includes a systematic literature review, building and Street View sampling, and annotation using the ChatGPT-4O API. The resulting database, validated with data from New York City, Amsterdam, and Singapore, provides a comprehensive tool for urban studies, supporting informed decision-making in urban planning, architectural design, and environmental policy. The code for BuildingView is available at https://github.com/Jasper0122/BuildingView.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yann Munro, Camilo Sarmiento, Isabelle Bloch, Gauvain Bourgne, Catherine Pelachaud, Marie-Jeanne Lesot</p>
<p>Abstract: An abstract argumentation framework is a commonly used formalism to provide a static representation of a dialogue. However, the order of enunciation of the arguments in an argumentative dialogue is very important and can affect the outcome of this dialogue. In this paper, we propose a new framework for modelling abstract argumentation graphs, a model that incorporates the order of enunciation of arguments. By taking this order into account, we have the means to deduce a unique outcome for each dialogue, called an extension. We also establish several properties, such as termination and correctness, and discuss two notions of completeness. In particular, we propose a modification of the previous transformation based on a "last enunciated last updated" strategy, which verifies the second form of completeness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang He, Peng Lin, Shaowei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) is an important problem in operations research. Local search is a powerful method for solving hard problems, but the research on local search algorithms for IQP solving is still on its early stage. This paper develops an efficient local search solver for solving general IQP, called LS-IQCQP. We propose four new local search operators for IQP that can handle quadratic terms in the objective function, constraints or both. Furthermore, a two-mode local search algorithm is introduced, utilizing newly designed scoring functions to enhance the search process. Experiments are conducted on standard IQP benchmarks QPLIB and MINLPLIB, comparing LS-IQCQP with several state-of-the-art IQP solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-IQCQP is competitive with the most powerful commercial solver Gurobi and outperforms other state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, LS-IQCQP has established 6 new records for QPLIB and MINLPLIB open instances.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19790">Analysis on Riemann Hypothesis with Cross Entropy Optimization and Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Li, Fulu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis [27], which is composed of three key components: a) probabilistic modeling with cross entropy optimization and reasoning; b) the application of the law of large numbers; c) the application of mathematical inductions. The analysis is mainly conducted by virtue of probabilistic modeling of cross entropy optimization and reasoning with rare event simulation techniques. The application of the law of large numbers [2, 3, 6] and the application of mathematical inductions make the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis self-contained and complete to make sure that the whole complex plane is covered as conjectured in Riemann Hypothesis. We also discuss the method of enhanced top-p sampling with large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, where next token prediction is not just based on the estimated probabilities of each possible token in the current round but also based on accumulated path probabilities among multiple top-k chain of thoughts (CoTs) paths. The probabilistic modeling of cross entropy optimization and reasoning may suit well with the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis as Riemann Zeta functions are inherently dealing with the sums of infinite components of a complex number series.
  We hope that our analysis in this paper could shed some light on some of the insights of Riemann Hypothesis. The framework and techniques presented in this paper, coupled with recent developments with chain of thought (CoT) or diagram of thought (DoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) [1, 7, 18, 21, 24, 34, 39-41], could pave the way for eventual proof of Riemann Hypothesis [27].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Wang, Junbo Li, Neel P. Bhatt, Yihan Xi, Qiang Liu, Ufuk Topcu, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in planning remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the planning capabilities of OpenAI's o1 models across a variety of benchmark tasks, focusing on three key aspects: feasibility, optimality, and generalizability. Through empirical evaluations on constraint-heavy tasks (e.g., $\textit{Barman}$, $\textit{Tyreworld}$) and spatially complex environments (e.g., $\textit{Termes}$, $\textit{Floortile}$), we highlight o1-preview's strengths in self-evaluation and constraint-following, while also identifying bottlenecks in decision-making and memory management, particularly in tasks requiring robust spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that o1-preview outperforms GPT-4 in adhering to task constraints and managing state transitions in structured environments. However, the model often generates suboptimal solutions with redundant actions and struggles to generalize effectively in spatially complex tasks. This pilot study provides foundational insights into the planning limitations of LLMs, offering key directions for future research on improving memory management, decision-making, and generalization in LLM-based planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on individual capabilities. However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which we term cross capabilities. To systematically explore this concept, we first define seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy. Building on these definitions, we introduce CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability. To ensure reliable evaluation, we involve expert annotators to assess 4,200 model responses, gathering 8,400 human ratings with detailed explanations to serve as reference examples. Our findings reveal that, in both static evaluations and attempts to enhance specific abilities, current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest component. Specifically, across 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models, 38 scores are lower than all individual capabilities, while 20 fall between strong and weak, but closer to the weaker ability. These results highlight the under-performance of LLMs in cross-capability tasks, making the identification and improvement of the weakest capabilities a critical priority for future research to optimize performance in complex, multi-dimensional scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel approach based on knowledge graphs to provide timely access to structured information, to enable actionable technology intelligence, and improve cyber-physical systems planning. Our framework encompasses a text mining process, which includes information retrieval, keyphrase extraction, semantic network creation, and topic map visualization. Following this data exploration process, we employ a selective knowledge graph construction (KGC) approach supported by an electronics and innovation ontology-backed pipeline for multi-objective decision-making with a focus on cyber-physical systems. We apply our methodology to the domain of automotive electrical systems to demonstrate the approach, which is scalable. Our results demonstrate that our construction process outperforms GraphGPT as well as our bi-LSTM and transformer REBEL with a pre-defined dataset by several times in terms of class recognition, relationship construction and correct "sublass of" categorization. Additionally, we outline reasoning applications and provide a comparison with Wikidata to show the differences and advantages of the approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20016">Personalisation via Dynamic Policy Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajsal Shereef Palattuparambil, Thommen George Karimpanal, Santu Rana</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies, although optimal in terms of task rewards, may not align with the personal preferences of human users. To ensure this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Ouyang, Yulan Hu, Ge Chen, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in processing text data, which has sparked interest in applying these models beyond textual data, such as graphs. In the field of graph learning, there is a growing interest in harnessing LLMs to comprehend and manipulate graph-structured data. Existing research predominantly focuses on graphs with rich textual features, such as knowledge graphs or text attribute graphs, leveraging LLMs' ability to process text but inadequately addressing graph structure. This work specifically aims to assess and enhance LLMs' abilities to comprehend and utilize the structural knowledge inherent in graph data itself, rather than focusing solely on graphs rich in textual content. To achieve this, we introduce the \textbf{G}raph \textbf{U}nderstanding for \textbf{N}atural Language \textbf{D}riven \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}odel (\model). This model adapts LLMs to better understand and engage with the structure of graph data, enabling them to perform complex reasoning tasks by leveraging the graph's structure itself. Our experimental evaluations on graph reasoning benchmarks not only substantiate that \model~ outperforms the SOTA baselines for comparisons. But also reveals key factors affecting the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis illustrating how reasoning paths can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Ott, Christian Meilicke, Heiner Stuckenschmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Within this paper, we show that the evaluation protocol currently used for inductive link prediction is heavily flawed as it relies on ranking the true entity in a small set of randomly sampled negative entities. Due to the limited size of the set of negatives, a simple rule-based baseline can achieve state-of-the-art results, which simply ranks entities higher based on the validity of their type. As a consequence of these insights, we reevaluate current approaches for inductive link prediction on several benchmarks using the link prediction protocol usually applied to the transductive setting. As some inductive methods suffer from scalability issues when evaluated in this setting, we propose and apply additionally an improved sampling protocol, which does not suffer from the problem mentioned above. The results of our evaluation differ drastically from the results reported in so far.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based agents have been widely applied as personal assistants, capable of memorizing information from user messages and responding to personal queries. However, there still lacks an objective and automatic evaluation on their memory capability, largely due to the challenges in constructing reliable questions and answers (QAs) according to user messages. In this paper, we propose MemSim, a Bayesian simulator designed to automatically construct reliable QAs from generated user messages, simultaneously keeping their diversity and scalability. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Relation Network (BRNet) and a causal generation mechanism to mitigate the impact of LLM hallucinations on factual information, facilitating the automatic creation of an evaluation dataset. Based on MemSim, we generate a dataset in the daily-life scenario, named MemDaily, and conduct extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide a benchmark for evaluating different memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents with the MemDaily dataset. To benefit the research community, we have released our project at https://github.com/nuster1128/MemSim.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Lu, Patrick Mannion, Karl Mason</p>
<p>Abstract: Many decision-making problems feature multiple objectives where it is not always possible to know the preferences of a human or agent decision-maker for different objectives. However, demonstrated behaviors from the decision-maker are often available. This research proposes a dynamic weight-based preference inference (DWPI) algorithm that can infer the preferences of agents acting in multi-objective decision-making problems from demonstrations. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three multi-objective Markov decision processes: Deep Sea Treasure, Traffic, and Item Gathering, and is compared to two existing preference inference algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements compared to the baseline algorithms, in terms of both time efficiency and inference accuracy. The DWPI algorithm maintains its performance when inferring preferences for sub-optimal demonstrations. Moreover, the DWPI algorithm does not necessitate any interactions with the user during inference - only demonstrations are required. We provide a correctness proof and complexity analysis of the algorithm and statistically evaluate the performance under different representation of demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Funkquist, Simon St{\aa}hlberg, Hector Geffner</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal instructions for autonomous AI agents cannot assume that objects have unique names. Instead, objects in goals must be referred to by providing suitable descriptions. However, this raises problems in both classical planning and generalized planning. The standard approach to handling existentially quantified goals in classical planning involves compiling them into a DNF formula that encodes all possible variable bindings and adding dummy actions to map each DNF term into the new, dummy goal. This preprocessing is exponential in the number of variables. In generalized planning, the problem is different: even if general policies can deal with any initial situation and goal, executing a general policy requires the goal to be grounded to define a value for the policy features. The problem of grounding goals, namely finding the objects to bind the goal variables, is subtle: it is a generalization of classical planning, which is a special case when there are no goal variables to bind, and constraint reasoning, which is a special case when there are no actions. In this work, we address the goal grounding problem with a novel supervised learning approach. A GNN architecture, trained to predict the cost of partially quantified goals over small domain instances is tested on larger instances involving more objects and different quantified goals. The proposed architecture is evaluated experimentally over several planning domains where generalization is tested along several dimensions including the number of goal variables and objects that can bind such variables. The scope of the approach is also discussed in light of the known relationship between GNNs and C2 logics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damiano Azzolini, Fabrizio Riguzzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic Answer Set Programming under the credal semantics (PASP) extends Answer Set Programming with probabilistic facts that represent uncertain information. The probabilistic facts are discrete with Bernoulli distributions. However, several real-world scenarios require a combination of both discrete and continuous random variables. In this paper, we extend the PASP framework to support continuous random variables and propose Hybrid Probabilistic Answer Set Programming (HPASP). Moreover, we discuss, implement, and assess the performance of two exact algorithms based on projected answer set enumeration and knowledge compilation and two approximate algorithms based on sampling. Empirical results, also in line with known theoretical results, show that exact inference is feasible only for small instances, but knowledge compilation has a huge positive impact on the performance. Sampling allows handling larger instances, but sometimes requires an increasing amount of memory. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the semantic web, ontology version control is required to capture time-varying information, most importantly for widely-used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation, performance measurement, and dataset construction for OV tasks. Reusing the prior alignment(s) from OM, we also propose a cross-reference mechanism to effectively reduce the matching candidature and improve overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and its cross-reference mechanism using three datasets from the Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and exploit insights on OM used for OV tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Huang, Yihua Cheng, Kezhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning architectures with powerful reasoning capabilities have driven significant advancements in autonomous driving technology. Large language models (LLMs) applied in this field can describe driving scenes and behaviors with a level of accuracy similar to human perception, particularly in visual tasks. Meanwhile, the rapid development of edge computing, with its advantage of proximity to data sources, has made edge devices increasingly important in autonomous driving. Edge devices process data locally, reducing transmission delays and bandwidth usage, and achieving faster response times. In this work, we propose a driving behavior narration and reasoning framework that applies LLMs to edge devices. The framework consists of multiple roadside units, with LLMs deployed on each unit. These roadside units collect road data and communicate via 5G NSR/NR networks. Our experiments show that LLMs deployed on edge devices can achieve satisfactory response speeds. Additionally, we propose a prompt strategy to enhance the narration and reasoning performance of the system. This strategy integrates multi-modal information, including environmental, agent, and motion data. Experiments conducted on the OpenDV-Youtube dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance across both tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwei Tang, Difan Jiao, Reid McIlroy-Young, Jon Kleinberg, Siddhartha Sen, Ashton Anderson</p>
<p>Abstract: There are an increasing number of domains in which artificial intelligence (AI) systems both surpass human ability and accurately model human behavior. This introduces the possibility of algorithmically-informed teaching in these domains through more relatable AI partners and deeper insights into human decision-making. Critical to achieving this goal, however, is coherently modeling human behavior at various skill levels. Chess is an ideal model system for conducting research into this kind of human-AI alignment, with its rich history as a pivotal testbed for AI research, mature superhuman AI systems like AlphaZero, and precise measurements of skill via chess rating systems. Previous work in modeling human decision-making in chess uses completely independent models to capture human style at different skill levels, meaning they lack coherence in their ability to adapt to the full spectrum of human improvement and are ultimately limited in their effectiveness as AI partners and teaching tools. In this work, we propose a unified modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve. Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a skill-aware attention mechanism to dynamically integrate players' strengths with encoded chess positions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill. Our experimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly enhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of expertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making and AI-guided teaching tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: The lack of reliable biomarkers makes predicting the conversion from intermediate to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (iAMD, nAMD) a challenging task. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) model to predict the future risk of conversion of an eye from iAMD to nAMD from its current OCT scan. Although eye clinics generate vast amounts of longitudinal OCT scans to monitor AMD progression, only a small subset can be manually labeled for supervised DL. To address this issue, we propose Morph-SSL, a novel Self-supervised Learning (SSL) method for longitudinal data. It uses pairs of unlabelled OCT scans from different visits and involves morphing the scan from the previous visit to the next. The Decoder predicts the transformation for morphing and ensures a smooth feature manifold that can generate intermediate scans between visits through linear interpolation. Next, the Morph-SSL trained features are input to a Classifier which is trained in a supervised manner to model the cumulative probability distribution of the time to conversion with a sigmoidal function. Morph-SSL was trained on unlabelled scans of 399 eyes (3570 visits). The Classifier was evaluated with a five-fold cross-validation on 2418 scans from 343 eyes with clinical labels of the conversion date. The Morph-SSL features achieved an AUC of 0.766 in predicting the conversion to nAMD within the next 6 months, outperforming the same network when trained end-to-end from scratch or pre-trained with popular SSL methods. Automated prediction of the future risk of nAMD onset can enable timely treatment and individualized AMD management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Sacks, Rwik Rana, Kevin Huang, Alex Spitzer, Guanya Shi, Byron Boots</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge in robotics is to design robust policies which enable complex and agile behaviors in the real world. On one end of the spectrum, we have model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL), which is incredibly flexible and general but often results in brittle policies. In contrast, model predictive control (MPC) continually re-plans at each time step to remain robust to perturbations and model inaccuracies. However, despite its real-world successes, MPC often under-performs the optimal strategy. This is due to model quality, myopic behavior from short planning horizons, and approximations due to computational constraints. And even with a perfect model and enough compute, MPC can get stuck in bad local optima, depending heavily on the quality of the optimization algorithm. To this end, we propose Deep Model Predictive Optimization (DMPO), which learns the inner-loop of an MPC optimization algorithm directly via experience, specifically tailored to the needs of the control problem. We evaluate DMPO on a real quadrotor agile trajectory tracking task, on which it improves performance over a baseline MPC algorithm for a given computational budget. It can outperform the best MPC algorithm by up to 27% with fewer samples and an end-to-end policy trained with MFRL by 19%. Moreover, because DMPO requires fewer samples, it can also achieve these benefits with 4.3X less memory. When we subject the quadrotor to turbulent wind fields with an attached drag plate, DMPO can adapt zero-shot while still outperforming all baselines.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have accelerated their integration into medicine. However, these developments have also raised public concerns about the safe application of AI. In healthcare, these concerns are especially pertinent, as the ethical and secure deployment of AI is crucial for protecting patient health and privacy. This review examines potential risks in AI practices that may compromise safety in medicine, including reduced performance across diverse populations, inconsistent operational stability, the need for high-quality data for effective model tuning, and the risk of data breaches during model development and deployment. For medical practitioners, patients, and researchers, LLMs provide a convenient way to interact with AI and data through language. However, their emergence has also amplified safety concerns, particularly due to issues like hallucination. Second part of this article explores safety issues specific to LLMs in medical contexts, including limitations in processing complex logic, challenges in aligning AI objectives with human values, the illusion of understanding, and concerns about diversity. Thoughtful development of safe AI could accelerate its adoption in real-world medical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our solutions for emotion recognition in the sub-challenges of Multimodal Emotion Recognition Challenge (MER2024). To mitigate the modal competition issue between audio and text, we adopt an early fusion strategy based on a large language model, where joint training of audio and text is conducted initially. And the joint Audio-Text modal feature will be late-fused with other unimodal features. In order to solve the problems of data insufficiency and class imbalance, We use multiple turns of multi-model voting for data mining. Moreover, to enhance the quality of audio features, we employ speech source separation to preprocess audios. Our model ranks \textbf{2nd} in both MER2024-SEMI and MER2024-NOISE, validating our method's effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motor pattern recognition paradigms are the main forms of Brain-Computer Interfaces(BCI) aimed at motor function rehabilitation and are the most easily promoted applications. In recent years, many researchers have suggested encouraging patients to perform real motor control execution simultaneously in MI-based BCI rehabilitation training systems. Electromyography (EMG) signals are the most direct physiological signals that can assess the execution of movements. Multimodal signal fusion is practically significant for decoding motor patterns. Therefore, we introduce a multimodal motion pattern recognition algorithm for EEG and EMG signals: EEG-EMG FAConformer, a method with several attention modules correlated with temporal and frequency information for motor pattern recognition. We especially devise a frequency band attention module to encode EEG information accurately and efficiently. What's more, modules like Multi-Scale Fusion Module, Independent Channel-Specific Convolution Module(ICSCM), and Fuse Module which can effectively eliminate irrelevant information in EEG and EMG signals and fully exploit hidden dynamics are developed and show great effects. Extensive experiments show that EEG-EMG FAConformer surpasses existing methods on Jeong2020 dataset, showcasing outstanding performance, high robustness and impressive stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently advancements in large multimodal models have led to significant strides in image comprehension capabilities. Despite these advancements, there is a lack of the robust benchmark specifically for assessing the Image-to-Web conversion proficiency of these large models. Primarily, it is essential to ensure the integrity of the web elements generated. These elements comprise visible and invisible categories. Previous evaluation methods (e.g., BLEU) are notably susceptible to significant alterations due to the presence of invisible elements in Web. Furthermore, it is crucial to measure the layout information of web pages, referring to the positional relationships between elements, which is overlooked by previous work. To address challenges, we have curated and aligned a benchmark of images and corresponding web codes (IW-Bench). Specifically, we propose the Element Accuracy, which tests the completeness of the elements by parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. Layout Accuracy is also proposed to analyze the positional relationships of elements by converting DOM tree into a common subsequence. Besides, we design a five-hop multimodal Chain-of-Thought Prompting for better performance, which contains five hop: 1) SoM prompt injection. 2) Inferring Elements. 3) Inferring Layout. 4) Inferring Web code. 5) Reflection. Our benchmark comprises 1200 pairs of images and web codes with varying levels of difficulty. We have conducted extensive experiments on existing large multimodal models, offering insights into their performance and areas for improvement in image-to-web domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haresh Karnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the field of machine learning have led to new ways for mobile robots to acquire advanced navigational capabilities. However, these learning-based methods raise the possibility that learned navigation behaviors may not align with the intentions and preferences of people, a problem known as value misalignment. To mitigate this risk, this dissertation aims to answer the question: "How can we use machine learning methods to align the navigational behaviors of autonomous mobile robots with human intentions and preferences?" First, this dissertation addresses this question by introducing a new approach to learning navigation behaviors by imitating human-provided demonstrations of the intended navigation task. This contribution allows mobile robots to acquire autonomous visual navigation capabilities through imitation, using a novel objective function that encourages the agent to align with the human's navigation objectives and penalizes misalignment. Second, this dissertation introduces two algorithms to enhance terrain-aware off-road navigation for mobile robots by learning visual terrain awareness in a self-supervised manner. This contribution enables mobile robots to respect a human operator's preferences for navigating different terrains in urban outdoor environments, while extrapolating these preferences to visually novel terrains by leveraging multi-modal representations. Finally, in the context of robot navigation in human-occupied environments, this dissertation introduces a dataset and an algorithm for robot navigation in a socially compliant manner in both indoor and outdoor environments. In summary, the contributions in this dissertation take significant steps toward addressing the value alignment problem in autonomous navigation, enabling mobile robots to navigate autonomously with objectives that align with human intentions and preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate interpretation of lab results is crucial in clinical medicine, yet most patient portals use universal normal ranges, ignoring factors like age and gender. This study introduces Lab-AI, an interactive system that offers personalized normal ranges using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from credible health sources. Lab-AI has two modules: factor retrieval and normal range retrieval. We tested these on 68 lab tests-30 with conditional factors and 38 without. For tests with factors, normal ranges depend on patient-specific information. Our results show that GPT-4-turbo with RAG achieved a 0.95 F1 score for factor retrieval and 0.993 accuracy for normal range retrieval. GPT-4-turbo with RAG outperformed the best non-RAG system by 29.1% in factor retrieval and showed 60.9% and 52.9% improvements in question-level and lab-level performance, respectively, for normal range retrieval. These findings highlight Lab-AI's potential to enhance patient understanding of lab results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Healthcare monitoring is crucial for early detection, timely intervention, and the ongoing management of health conditions, ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in supporting healthcare tasks. However, existing LLM-based healthcare solutions typically rely on cloud-based systems, which raise privacy concerns and increase the risk of personal information leakage. As a result, there is growing interest in running these models locally on devices like mobile phones and wearables to protect users' privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs) are potential candidates to solve privacy and computational issues, as they are more efficient and better suited for local deployment. However, the performance of SLMs in healthcare domains has not yet been investigated. This paper examines the capability of SLMs to accurately analyze health data, such as steps, calories, sleep minutes, and other vital statistics, to assess an individual's health status. Our results show that, TinyLlama, which has 1.1 billion parameters, utilizes 4.31 GB memory, and has 0.48s latency, showing the best performance compared other four state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLMs on various healthcare applications. Our results indicate that SLMs could potentially be deployed on wearable or mobile devices for real-time health monitoring, providing a practical solution for efficient and privacy-preserving healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Lan Zhao, Junhao Ren, Yajuan Sun, Chuan Fu Tan, Zhiquan Yeo, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective information gathering and knowledge codification are pivotal for developing recommendation systems that promote circular economy practices. One promising approach involves the creation of a centralized knowledge repository cataloguing historical waste-to-resource transactions, which subsequently enables the generation of recommendations based on past successes. However, a significant barrier to constructing such a knowledge repository lies in the absence of a universally standardized framework for representing business activities across disparate geographical regions. To address this challenge, this paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify textual data describing economic activities into the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), a globally recognized economic activity classification framework. This approach enables any economic activity descriptions provided by businesses worldwide to be categorized into the unified ISIC standard, facilitating the creation of a centralized knowledge repository. Our approach achieves a 95% accuracy rate on a 182-label test dataset with fine-tuned GPT-2 model. This research contributes to the global endeavour of fostering sustainable circular economy practices by providing a standardized foundation for knowledge codification and recommendation systems deployable across regions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces SC-Phi2, a fine-tuned StarCraft II small language model for macromanagement tasks. Small language models, like Phi2, Gemma, and DistilBERT, are streamlined versions of large language models (LLMs) with fewer parameters that require less power and memory to run. To teach Microsoft's Phi2 model about StarCraft, we create a new SC2 text dataset with information about StarCraft races, roles, and actions and use it to fine-tune Phi-2 with self-supervised learning. We pair this language model with a Vision Transformer (ViT) from the pre-trained BLIP-2 (Bootstrapping Language Image Pre-training) model, fine-tuning it on the MSC replay dataset. This enables us to construct dynamic prompts that include visual game state information. Unlike the large models used in StarCraft LLMs such as GPT-3.5, Phi2 is trained primarily on textbook data and contains little inherent knowledge of StarCraft II beyond what is provided by our training process. By using LoRA (Low-rank Adaptation) and quantization, our model can be trained on a single GPU. We demonstrate that our model performs well at micromanagement tasks such as build order and global state prediction with a small number of parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models of event comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehension theories to contemporary event cognition frameworks. The review covers key discourse comprehension accounts, including Construction-Integration, Event Indexing, Causal Network, and Resonance models, highlighting their contributions to understanding cognitive processes in comprehension. I then discuss contemporary theoretical frameworks of event comprehension, including Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007), the Event Horizon Model (Radvansky & Zacks, 2014), and Hierarchical Generative Framework (Kuperberg, 2021), which emphasize prediction, causality, and multilevel representations in event understanding. Building on these theories, I evaluate five computational models of event comprehension: REPRISE (Butz et al., 2019), Structured Event Memory (SEM; Franklin et al., 2020), the Lu model (Lu et al., 2022), the Gumbsch model (Gumbsch et al., 2022), and the Elman and McRae model (2019). The analysis focuses on their approaches to hierarchical processing, prediction mechanisms, and representation learning. Key themes that emerge include the use of hierarchical structures as inductive biases, the importance of prediction in comprehension, and diverse strategies for learning event dynamics. The review identifies critical areas for future research, including the need for more sophisticated approaches to learning structured representations, integrating episodic memory mechanisms, and developing adaptive updating algorithms for working event models. By synthesizing insights from both theoretical frameworks and computational implementations, this review aims to advance our understanding of human event comprehension and guide future modeling efforts in cognitive science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Kohane</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, understanding how well their decision-making aligns with human preferences and values becomes crucial, especially when we recognize that there is no single gold standard for these preferences. This paper applies a systematic methodology for evaluating preference alignment in LLMs on categorical decision-making with medical triage as a domain-specific use case. It also measures how effectively an alignment procedure will change the alignment of a specific model. Key to this methodology is a novel simple measure, the Alignment Compliance Index (ACI), that quantifies how effectively a LLM can be aligned to a given preference function or gold standard. Since the ACI measures the effect rather than the process of alignment, it is applicable to alignment methods beyond the in-context learning used in this study.
  Using a dataset of simulated patient pairs, three frontier LLMs (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Advanced) were assessed on their ability to make triage decisions consistent with an expert clinician's preferences. The models' performance before and after alignment attempts was evaluated using various prompting strategies. The results reveal significant variability in alignment effectiveness across models and alignment approaches. Notably, models that performed well, as measured by ACI, pre-alignment sometimes degraded post-alignment, and small changes in the target preference function led to large shifts in model rankings. The implicit ethical principles, as understood by humans, underlying the LLMs' decisions were also explored through targeted questioning.
  This study motivates the use of a practical set of methods and the ACI, in the near term, to understand the correspondence between the variety of human and LLM decision-making values in categorical decision-making such as triage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-modal reasoning (CMR), the intricate process of synthesizing and drawing inferences across divergent sensory modalities, is increasingly recognized as a crucial capability in the progression toward more sophisticated and anthropomorphic artificial intelligence systems. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a class of AI algorithms specifically engineered to parse, produce, and engage with human language on an extensive scale.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiateng Liu, Lin Ai, Zizhou Liu, Payam Karisani, Zheng Hui, May Fung, Preslav Nakov, Julia Hirschberg, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Propaganda plays a critical role in shaping public opinion and fueling disinformation. While existing research primarily focuses on identifying propaganda techniques, it lacks the ability to capture the broader motives and the impacts of such content. To address these challenges, we introduce propainsight, a conceptual framework grounded in foundational social science research, which systematically dissects propaganda into techniques, arousal appeals, and underlying intent. propainsight offers a more granular understanding of how propaganda operates across different contexts. Additionally, we present propagaze, a novel dataset that combines human-annotated data with high-quality synthetic data generated through a meticulously designed pipeline. Our experiments show that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle with propaganda analysis, but training with propagaze significantly improves performance. Fine-tuned Llama-7B-Chat achieves 203.4% higher text span IoU in technique identification and 66.2% higher BertScore in appeal analysis compared to 1-shot GPT-4-Turbo. Moreover, propagaze complements limited human-annotated data in data-sparse and cross-domain scenarios, showing its potential for comprehensive and generalizable propaganda analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mael Jullien, Alex Bogatu, Harriet Unsworth, Andre Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trials demands a systematic and reasoned interpretation of documents which require significant expert-level background knowledge, over a complex set of well-defined eligibility criteria. Moreover, this interpretation process needs to operate at scale, over vast knowledge bases of trials. In this paper, we propose a scalable method that extends the capabilities of LLMs in the direction of systematizing the reasoning over sets of medical eligibility criteria, evaluating it in the context of real-world cases. The proposed method overlays a Set-guided reasoning method for LLMs. The proposed framework is evaluated on TREC 2022 Clinical Trials, achieving results superior to the state-of-the-art: NDCG@10 of 0.693 and Precision@10 of 0.73.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Vijay Sri Vaikunth, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: Patents are the currency of innovation, and like any currency, they need to be managed and protected (Gavin Potenza). Patents, as legal documents that secure intellectual property rights, play a critical role in technological innovation. The growing complexity of patent documents and the surge in patent applications have created a need for automated solutions in patent analysis. In this work, we present PatExpert, an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework designed to streamline and optimize patent-related tasks. The framework consists of a metaagent that coordinates task-specific expert agents for various patent-related tasks and a critique agent for error handling and feedback provision. The meta-agent orchestrates specialized expert agents, each fine-tuned for specific tasks such as patent classification, acceptance, claim generation, abstractive summarization, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. For multi-patent analysis, the framework incorporates advanced methods like Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) to enhance response accuracy and relevance by combining semantic similarity with knowledge graphs. Error handling is managed by critique agents (Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge), which evaluate output responses for accuracy and provide iterative feedback. The framework also prioritizes explainability, ensuring transparent justifications for decisions made during patent analysis. Its comprehensive capabilities make it a valuable tool for automating complex patent workflows, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in patent-related tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in patent processing tasks, concluding that the framework offers a robust solution for automating and optimizing patent analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent improvement in large language models, open doors for certain new experiences for on-device applications which were not possible before. In this work, we propose 3 such new experiences in 2 categories. First we discuss experiences which can be powered in screen understanding i.e. understanding whats on user screen namely - (1) visual question answering, and (2) automated form filling based on previous screen. The second category of experience which can be extended are smart replies to support for multilingual speakers with code-switching. Code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages. To the best of our knowledge, this is first such work to propose these tasks and solutions to each of them, to bridge the gap between latest research and real world impact of the research in on-device applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saumya Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: In this thesis, I evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), specifically the Logic Games section of the test. I focus on this section because it presents a complex logical reasoning task and thus is a valuable source of data for evaluating how modern, increasingly capable LLMs can handle hard logical reasoning tasks. I construct a dataset of LSAT logic games and their associated metadata, and extensively evaluate LLMs' performance in a Chain-of-Thought prompting setting. Given the weak performance in this setting, I explore other prompting frameworks on a smaller subset of the dataset, adapting ideas from Reflexion to this task. This results in a substantially improved accuracy of 70 percent for GPT-4 and 46 percent for GPT-3.5 on this data subset, highlighting the capacity of LLMs to revise their logical errors, despite initially weak performance. Finally, I analyze the types of logic games that models perform better or worse on, as well as the types of logical errors I observe from human annotation, providing detailed insights on the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengpei Cheng, Yingyi Wu, Danyang Zhang, Jiacheng Hu, Yujian Long</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenges of assessing foundational academic skills by leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional assessment methods often struggle to provide timely and comprehensive feedback on key cognitive and linguistic aspects, such as coherence, syntax, and analytical reasoning. Our approach integrates multiple state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, and T5, within an ensemble learning framework. These models are combined through stacking techniques using LightGBM and Ridge regression to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology involves detailed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and pseudo-label learning to optimize model performance. By incorporating sophisticated NLP techniques and ensemble learning, this study significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of assessments, offering a robust solution that surpasses traditional methods and opens new avenues for educational technology research focused on enhancing core academic competencies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work addresses the persistent challenges of substantial training time and GPU resource requirements even when training lightweight encoder-vocoder models for Textless NLP. We reduce training steps significantly while improving performance by a) leveraging learning rate schedulers for efficient and faster convergence b) optimizing hop length and c) tuning the interpolation scale factors for better audio quality. Additionally, we explore the latent space representation for Indian languages such as Tamil and Bengali for the acoustic unit discovery and voice conversion task. Our approach leverages a quantized encoder architecture, in conjunction with a vocoder which utilizes the proposed mixture of optimized hop length, tuned interpolation scale factors and a cyclic learning rate scheduler. We obtain consistently good results across English, Tamil and Bengali datasets. The proposed method excels in capturing complex linguistic patterns, resulting in clear reconstructed audio during voice conversion with significantly reduced training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonis Papasavva, Shane Johnson, Ed Lowther, Samantha Lundrigan, Enrico Mariconti, Anna Markovska, Nilufer Tuptuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Fraud is a prevalent offence that extends beyond financial loss, causing psychological and physical harm to victims. The advancements in online communication technologies alowed for online fraud to thrive in this vast network, with fraudsters increasingly using these channels for deception. With the progression of technologies like AI, there is a growing concern that fraud will scale up, using sophisticated methods, like deep-fakes in phishing campaigns, all generated by language generation models like ChatGPT. However, the application of AI in detecting and analyzing online fraud remains understudied. We conduct a Systematic Literature Review on AI and NLP techniques for online fraud detection. The review adhered the PRISMA-ScR protocol, with eligibility criteria including relevance to online fraud, use of text data, and AI methodologies. We screened 2,457 academic records, 350 met our eligibility criteria, and included 223. We report the state-of-the-art NLP techniques for analysing various online fraud categories; the training data sources; the NLP algorithms and models built; and the performance metrics employed for model evaluation. We find that current research on online fraud is divided into various scam activitiesand identify 16 different frauds that researchers focus on. This SLR enhances the academic understanding of AI-based detection methods for online fraud and offers insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and businesses on safeguarding against such activities. We conclude that focusing on specific scams lacks generalization, as multiple models are required for different fraud types. The evolving nature of scams limits the effectiveness of models trained on outdated data. We also identify issues in data limitations, training bias reporting, and selective presentation of metrics in model performance reporting, which can lead to potential biases in model evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Liu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xiaokang Chen, Jing Yao, Jingwei Yi, Daoguang Zan, Zheng Liu, Xing Xie, Tsung-Yi Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for regulating potentially risky behaviors of large language models (LLMs) has ignited research on alignment methods. Since LLM alignment heavily relies on reward models for optimization or evaluation, neglecting the quality of reward models may cause unreliable results or even misalignment. Despite the vital role reward models play in alignment, previous works have consistently overlooked their performance and used off-the-shelf reward models arbitrarily without verification, rendering the reward model ``\emph{an elephant in the room}''. To this end, this work first investigates the quality of the widely-used preference dataset, HH-RLHF, and curates a clean version, CHH-RLHF. Based on CHH-RLHF, we benchmark the accuracy of a broad range of reward models used in previous alignment works, unveiling the unreliability of using them both for optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, we systematically study the impact of reward model quality on alignment performance in three reward utilization paradigms. Extensive experiments reveal that better reward models perform as better human preference proxies. This work aims to awaken people to notice this huge elephant in alignment research. We call attention to the following issues: (1) The reward model needs to be rigorously evaluated, whether for alignment optimization or evaluation. (2) Considering the role of reward models, research efforts should not only concentrate on alignment algorithm, but also on developing more reliable human proxy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikunj Saunshi, Stefani Karp, Shankar Krishnan, Sobhan Miryoosefi, Sashank J. Reddi, Sanjiv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the increasing scale of model sizes, novel training strategies like gradual stacking [Gong et al., 2019, Reddi et al., 2023] have garnered interest. Stacking enables efficient training by gradually growing the depth of a model in stages and using layers from a smaller model in an earlier stage to initialize the next stage. Although efficient for training, the model biases induced by such growing approaches are largely unexplored. In this work, we examine this fundamental aspect of gradual stacking, going beyond its efficiency benefits. We propose a variant of gradual stacking called MIDAS that can speed up language model training by up to 40%. Furthermore we discover an intriguing phenomenon: MIDAS is not only training-efficient but surprisingly also has an inductive bias towards improving downstream tasks, especially tasks that require reasoning abilities like reading comprehension and math problems, despite having similar or slightly worse perplexity compared to baseline training. To further analyze this inductive bias, we construct reasoning primitives -- simple synthetic tasks that are building blocks for reasoning -- and find that a model pretrained with stacking is significantly better than standard pretraining on these primitives, with and without fine-tuning. This provides stronger and more robust evidence for this inductive bias towards reasoning. These findings of training efficiency and inductive bias towards reasoning are verified at 1B, 2B and 8B parameter language models. Finally, we conjecture the underlying reason for this inductive bias by exploring the connection of stacking to looped models and provide strong supporting empirical analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents multimodal markup document models (MarkupDM) that can generate both markup language and images within interleaved multimodal documents. Unlike existing vision-and-language multimodal models, our MarkupDM tackles unique challenges critical to graphic design tasks: generating partial images that contribute to the overall appearance, often involving transparency and varying sizes, and understanding the syntax and semantics of markup languages, which play a fundamental role as a representational format of graphic designs. To address these challenges, we design an image quantizer to tokenize images of diverse sizes with transparency and modify a code language model to process markup languages and incorporate image modalities. We provide in-depth evaluations of our approach on three graphic design completion tasks: generating missing attribute values, images, and texts in graphic design templates. Results corroborate the effectiveness of our MarkupDM for graphic design tasks. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses in detail, providing insights for future research on multimodal document generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobo Li, Zhaowei Wang, Jiachen Wang, Alexis Kai Hon Lau, Huamin Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting weather and climate events is crucial for making appropriate measures to mitigate environmental hazards and minimize associated losses. Previous research on environmental forecasting focuses on predicting numerical meteorological variables related to closed-set events rather than forecasting open-set events directly, which limits the comprehensiveness of event forecasting. We propose Weather and Climate Event Forecasting (WCEF), a new task that leverages meteorological raster data and textual event data to predict potential weather and climate events. However, due to difficulties in aligning multimodal data and the lack of sufficient supervised datasets, this task is challenging to accomplish. Therefore, we first propose a framework to align historical meteorological data with past weather and climate events using the large language model (LLM). In this framework, we construct a knowledge graph by using LLM to extract information about weather and climate events from a corpus of over 41k highly environment-focused news articles. Subsequently, we mapped these events with meteorological raster data, creating a supervised dataset, which is the largest and most novel for LLM tuning on the WCEF task. Finally, we introduced our aligned models, CLLMate (LLM for climate), a multimodal LLM to forecast weather and climate events using meteorological raster data. In evaluating CLLMate, we conducted extensive experiments. The results indicate that CLLMate surpasses both the baselines and other multimodal LLMs, showcasing the potential of utilizing LLM to align weather and climate events with meteorological data and highlighting the promising future for research on the WCEF task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Fu, Jie He, Yifan Yang, Qun Liu, Deyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta learning has been widely used to exploit rich-resource source tasks to improve the performance of low-resource target tasks. Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mahshad Lotfinia, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Tomas Arias-Vergara, Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave, Maria Schuster, Andreas Maier, Seung Hee Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life. While deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these disorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although differential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its application in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite the equally critical privacy concerns. This study is the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with a privacy budget, denoted by {\epsilon}, of 7.51. To generalize our findings, we validated our approach on a smaller dataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, demonstrating that careful pretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain or even improve model accuracy under DP constraints. We also conducted a comprehensive fairness analysis, revealing that reasonable privacy levels (2<{\epsilon}<10) do not introduce significant gender bias, though age-related disparities may require further attention. Our results suggest that DP can effectively balance privacy and utility in speech disorder detection, but also highlight the unique challenges in the speech domain, particularly regarding the privacy-fairness trade-off. This provides a foundation for future work to refine DP methodologies and address fairness across diverse patient groups in real-world deployments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid scaling of AI has spurred a growing emphasis on ethical considerations in both development and practice. This has led to the formulation of increasingly sophisticated model auditing and reporting requirements, as well as governance frameworks to mitigate potential risks to individuals and society. At this critical juncture, we review the practical challenges of promoting responsible AI and transparency in informal sectors like OSS that support vital infrastructure and see widespread use. We focus on how model performance evaluation may inform or inhibit probing of model limitations, biases, and other risks. Our controlled analysis of 7903 Hugging Face projects found that risk documentation is strongly associated with evaluation practices. Yet, submissions (N=789) from the platform's most popular competitive leaderboard showed less accountability among high performers. Our findings can inform AI providers and legal scholars in designing interventions and policies that preserve open-source innovation while incentivizing ethical uptake.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manil Shrestha, Yashodha Ravichandran, Edward Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: As usage of generative AI tools skyrockets, the amount of sensitive information being exposed to these models and centralized model providers is alarming. For example, confidential source code from Samsung suffered a data leak as the text prompt to ChatGPT encountered data leakage. An increasing number of companies are restricting the use of LLMs (Apple, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, etc.) due to data leakage or confidentiality issues. Also, an increasing number of centralized generative model providers are restricting, filtering, aligning, or censoring what can be used. Midjourney and RunwayML, two of the major image generation platforms, restrict the prompts to their system via prompt filtering. Certain political figures are restricted from image generation, as well as words associated with women's health care, rights, and abortion.
  In our research, we present a secure and private methodology for generative artificial intelligence that does not expose sensitive data or models to third-party AI providers. Our work modifies the key building block of modern generative AI algorithms, e.g. the transformer, and introduces confidential and verifiable multiparty computations in a decentralized network to maintain the 1) privacy of the user input and obfuscation to the output of the model, and 2) introduce privacy to the model itself. Additionally, the sharding process reduces the computational burden on any one node, enabling the distribution of resources of large generative AI processes across multiple, smaller nodes. We show that as long as there exists one honest node in the decentralized computation, security is maintained. We also show that the inference process will still succeed if only a majority of the nodes in the computation are successful. Thus, our method offers both secure and verifiable computation in a decentralized network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxu Wei, Kanhao Zhao, Yong Jiao, Nancy B. Carlisle, Hua Xie, Gregory A. Fonzo, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promise in detecting functional abnormalities in various brain disorders. However, existing studies often focus on a single domain or modality, neglecting the valuable complementary information offered by multiple domains from both fMRI and EEG, which is crucial for a comprehensive representation of disorder pathology. This limitation poses a challenge in effectively leveraging the synergistic information derived from these modalities. To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Cross-domain Self-supervised Pre-training Model (MCSP), a novel approach that leverages self-supervised learning to synergize multi-modal information across spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Our model employs cross-domain self-supervised loss that bridges domain differences by implementing domain-specific data augmentation and contrastive loss, enhancing feature discrimination. Furthermore, MCSP introduces cross-modal self-supervised loss to capitalize on the complementary information of fMRI and EEG, facilitating knowledge distillation within domains and maximizing cross-modal feature convergence. We constructed a large-scale pre-training dataset and pretrained MCSP model by leveraging proposed self-supervised paradigms to fully harness multimodal neuroimaging data. Through comprehensive experiments, we have demonstrated the superior performance and generalizability of our model on multiple classification tasks. Our study contributes a significant advancement in the fusion of fMRI and EEG, marking a novel integration of cross-domain features, which enriches the existing landscape of neuroimaging research, particularly within the context of mental disorder studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lance Kennedy, Andreas Z\"ufle</p>
<p>Abstract: Historically, much of the research in understanding, modeling, and mining human trajectory data has focused on where an individual stays. Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Judah Goldfeder, Quinten Roets, Gabe Guo, John Wright, Hod Lipson</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring the exact parameters of a neural network with only query access is an NP-Hard problem, with few practical existing algorithms. Solutions would have major implications for security, verification, interpretability, and understanding biological networks. The key challenges are the massive parameter space, and complex non-linear relationships between neurons. We resolve these challenges using two insights. First, we observe that almost all networks used in practice are produced by random initialization and first order optimization, an inductive bias that drastically reduces the practical parameter space. Second, we present a novel query generation algorithm that produces maximally informative samples, letting us untangle the non-linear relationships efficiently. We demonstrate reconstruction of a hidden network containing over 1.5 million parameters, and of one 7 layers deep, the largest and deepest reconstructions to date, with max parameter difference less than 0.0001, and illustrate robustness and scalability across a variety of architectures, datasets, and training procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoqi Yang, Yanan Wang, Yong Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation tasks, which aim to predict the next item a user will interact with, typically rely on models trained solely on historical data. However, in real-world scenarios, user behavior can fluctuate in the long interaction sequences, and training data may be limited to model this dynamics. To address this, Test-Time Training (TTT) offers a novel approach by using self-supervised learning during inference to dynamically update model parameters. This allows the model to adapt to new user interactions in real-time, leading to more accurate recommendations. In this paper, we propose TTT4Rec, a sequential recommendation framework that integrates TTT to better capture dynamic user behavior. By continuously updating model parameters during inference, TTT4Rec is particularly effective in scenarios where user interaction sequences are long, training data is limited, or user behavior is highly variable. We evaluate TTT4Rec on three widely-used recommendation datasets, demonstrating that it achieves performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowd Counting is a fundamental topic, aiming to estimate the number of individuals in the crowded images or videos fed from surveillance cameras. Recent works focus on improving counting accuracy, while ignoring the certified robustness of counting models. In this paper, we propose a novel Bound Tightening Network (BTN) for Robust Crowd Counting. It consists of three parts: base model, smooth regularization module and certify bound module. The core idea is to propagate the interval bound through the base model (certify bound module) and utilize the layer weights (smooth regularization module) to guide the network learning. Experiments on different benchmark datasets for counting demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BTN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Liu, Zhixin Lai, Gengyuan Zhang, Philip Torr, Vera Demberg, Volker Tresp, Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable advancements in terms of image quality and fidelity to textual prompts. Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two close-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from 8\% to 74\%. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while current classifiers may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. Our work provides a foundation for further development towards more secure and reliable T2I models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Hackmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation language model deployments often include auxiliary guard-rail models to filter or classify text, detecting jailbreak attempts, biased or toxic output, or ensuring topic adherence. These additional models increase the complexity and cost of model inference, especially since many are also large language models. To address this issue, we explore training-free model merging techniques to consolidate these models into a single, multi-functional model. We propose Heterogeneous Multi-Class Model Merging (HM3) as a simple technique for merging multi-class classifiers with heterogeneous label spaces. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, which require extensive training and add complexity during inference, recent advancements allow models to be merged in a training-free manner. We report promising results for merging BERT-based guard models, some of which attain an average F1-score higher than the source models while reducing the inference time by up to 44%. We introduce self-merging to assess the impact of reduced task-vector density, finding that the more poorly performing hate speech classifier benefits from self-merging while higher-performing classifiers do not, which raises questions about using task vector reduction for model tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Jie Chong (Zephyr),  Zhihao (Zephyr),  Yao, Iulian Neamtiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating code via a LLM (rather than writing code from scratch), has exploded in popularity. However, the security implications of LLM-generated code are still unknown. We performed a study that compared the security and quality of human-written code with that of LLM-generated code, for a wide range of programming tasks, including data structures, algorithms, cryptographic routines, and LeetCode questions. To assess code security we used unit testing, fuzzing, and static analysis. For code quality, we focused on complexity and size. We found that LLM can generate incorrect code that fails to implement the required functionality, especially for more complicated tasks; such errors can be subtle. For example, for the cryptographic algorithm SHA1, LLM generated an incorrect implementation that nevertheless compiles. In cases where its functionality was correct, we found that LLM-generated code is less secure, primarily due to the lack of defensive programming constructs, which invites a host of security issues such as buffer overflows or integer overflows. Fuzzing has revealed that LLM-generated code is more prone to hangs and crashes than human-written code. Quality-wise, we found that LLM generates bare-bones code that lacks defensive programming constructs, and is typically more complex (per line of code) compared to human-written code. Next, we constructed a feedback loop that asked the LLM to re-generate the code and eliminate the found issues (e.g., malloc overflow, array index out of bounds, null dereferences). We found that the LLM fails to eliminate such issues consistently: while succeeding in some cases, we found instances where the re-generated, supposedly more secure code, contains new issues; we also found that upon prompting, LLM can introduce issues in files that were issues-free before prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihua Qin, Ming Zhang, Juan Shan, Taehoon Shin, Jonghye Woo, Fangxu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) are critical indicators of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Since they often appear as small, irregular structures with indistinguishable edges in knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs), effective detection of BMLs in MRI is vital for OA diagnosis and treatment. This paper proposes a semi-supervised local anomaly detection method using mask inpainting models for identification of BMLs in high-resolution knee MRI, effectively integrating a 3D femur bone segmentation model, a large mask inpainting model, and a series of post-processing techniques. The method was evaluated using MRIs at various resolutions from a subset of the public Osteoarthritis Initiative database. Dice score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and pixel-level sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy showed an advantage over the multiresolution knowledge distillation method-a state-of-the-art global anomaly detection method. Especially, segmentation performance is enhanced on higher-resolution images, achieving an over two times performance increase on the Dice score and the IoU score at a 448x448 resolution level. We also demonstrate that with increasing size of the BML region, both the Dice and IoU scores improve as the proportion of distinguishable boundary decreases. The identified BML masks can serve as markers for downstream tasks such as segmentation and classification. The proposed method has shown a potential in improving BML detection, laying a foundation for further advances in imaging-based OA research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alicia Li, Nishanth Kumar, Tom\'as Lozano-P\'erez, Leslie Kaelbling</p>
<p>Abstract: The real world is unpredictable. Therefore, to solve long-horizon decision-making problems with autonomous robots, we must construct agents that are capable of adapting to changes in the environment during deployment. Model-based planning approaches can enable robots to solve complex, long-horizon tasks in a variety of environments. However, such approaches tend to be brittle when deployed into an environment featuring a novel situation that their underlying model does not account for. In this work, we propose to learn a ``bridge policy'' via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adapt to such novelties. We introduce a simple formulation for such learning, where the RL problem is constructed with a special ``CallPlanner'' action that terminates the bridge policy and hands control of the agent back to the planner. This allows the RL policy to learn the set of states in which querying the planner and following the returned plan will achieve the goal. We show that this formulation enables the agent to rapidly learn by leveraging the planner's knowledge to avoid challenging long-horizon exploration caused by sparse reward. In experiments across three different simulated domains of varying complexity, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn policies that adapt to novelty more efficiently than several baselines, including a pure RL baseline. We also demonstrate that the learned bridge policy is generalizable in that it can be combined with the planner to enable the agent to solve more complex tasks with multiple instances of the encountered novelty.</p>

<p>Abstract: To obtain better value estimation in reinforcement learning, we propose a novel algorithm based on the double actor-critic framework with temporal difference error-driven regularization, abbreviated as TDDR. TDDR employs double actors, with each actor paired with a critic, thereby fully leveraging the advantages of double critics. Additionally, TDDR introduces an innovative critic regularization architecture. Compared to classical deterministic policy gradient-based algorithms that lack a double actor-critic structure, TDDR provides superior estimation. Moreover, unlike existing algorithms with double actor-critic frameworks, TDDR does not introduce any additional hyperparameters, significantly simplifying the design and implementation process. Experiments demonstrate that TDDR exhibits strong competitiveness compared to benchmark algorithms in challenging continuous control tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The well-worn George Box aphorism ``all models are wrong, but some are useful'' is particularly salient in the cybersecurity domain, where the assumptions built into a model can have substantial financial or even national security impacts. Computer scientists are often asked to optimize for worst-case outcomes, and since security is largely focused on risk mitigation, preparing for the worst-case scenario appears rational. In this work, we demonstrate that preparing for the worst case rather than the most probable case may yield suboptimal outcomes for learning agents. Through the lens of stochastic Bayesian games, we first explore different attacker knowledge modeling assumptions that impact the usefulness of models to cybersecurity practitioners. By considering different models of attacker knowledge about the state of the game and a defender's hidden information, we find that there is a cost to the defender for optimizing against the worst case.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose edit operation based lexically constrained decoding for sentence simplification. In sentence simplification, lexical paraphrasing is one of the primary procedures for rewriting complex sentences into simpler correspondences. While previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of lexically constrained decoding on this task, their constraints can be loose and may lead to sub-optimal generation. We address this problem by designing constraints that replicate the edit operations conducted in simplification and defining stricter satisfaction conditions. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the previous studies on three English simplification corpora commonly used in this task.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of developing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning, with a particular focus on robustness against hallucinations. Existing metrics are often inadequate for handling hallucinations, primarily due to their limited ability to compare candidate captions with multifaceted reference captions. To address this shortcoming, we propose DENEB, a novel supervised automatic evaluation metric specifically robust against hallucinations. DENEB incorporates the Sim-Vec Transformer, a mechanism that processes multiple references simultaneously, thereby efficiently capturing the similarity between an image, a candidate caption, and reference captions. To train DENEB, we construct the diverse and balanced Nebula dataset comprising 32,978 images, paired with human judgments provided by 805 annotators. We demonstrated that DENEB achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing LLM-free metrics on the FOIL, Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and PASCAL-50S datasets, validating its effectiveness and robustness against hallucinations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Activity recognition is a challenging task due to the large scale of trajectory data and the need for prompt and efficient processing. Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio separation in real-world scenarios, where mixtures contain a variable number of sources, presents significant challenges due to limitations of existing models, such as over-separation, under-separation, and dependence on predefined training sources. We propose OpenSep, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for automated audio separation, eliminating the need for manual intervention and overcoming source limitations. OpenSep uses textual inversion to generate captions from audio mixtures with off-the-shelf audio captioning models, effectively parsing the sound sources present. It then employs few-shot LLM prompting to extract detailed audio properties of each parsed source, facilitating separation in unseen mixtures. Additionally, we introduce a multi-level extension of the mix-and-separate training framework to enhance modality alignment by separating single source sounds and mixtures simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate OpenSep's superiority in precisely separating new, unseen, and variable sources in challenging mixtures, outperforming SOTA baseline methods.

<p>Abstract: Optimizing problems in a distributed manner is critical for systems involving multiple agents with private data. Despite substantial interest, a unified method for analyzing the convergence rates of distributed optimization algorithms is lacking. This paper introduces an energy conservation approach for analyzing continuous-time dynamical systems in dilated coordinates. Instead of directly analyzing dynamics in the original coordinate system, we establish a conserved quantity, akin to physical energy, in the dilated coordinate system. Consequently, convergence rates can be explicitly expressed in terms of the inverse time-dilation factor. Leveraging this generalized approach, we formulate a novel second-order distributed accelerated gradient flow with a convergence rate of $O\left(1/t^{2-\epsilon}\right)$ in time $t$ for $\epsilon>0$. We then employ a semi second-order symplectic Euler discretization to derive a rate-matching algorithm with a convergence rate of $O\left(1/k^{2-\epsilon}\right)$ in $k$ iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the most favorable convergence rate for any distributed optimization algorithm designed for smooth convex optimization. Its accelerated convergence behavior is benchmarked against various state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms on practical, large-scale problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihai Zhang, Xiaoye Qu, Tong Zhu, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in multimodal intelligence. However, recent studies have identified that the information loss in the CLIP encoding process is substantial, and CLIP tends to capture only coarse-grained features from the input. This deficiency significantly limits the ability of a single CLIP model to handle images rich in visual detail. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic strategy, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), for CLIP. DMU efficiently fine-tunes a series of CLIP models that capture different feature spaces, from a dense pre-trained CLIP checkpoint, sharing parameters except for the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These models can then be transformed into a CLIP-MoE with a larger model capacity, leading to significantly enhanced performance with minimal computational overhead. To the best of our knowledge, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling is the first approach to introduce sparsely activated MoE into CLIP foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks by serving as a vision encoder. Furthermore, Diversified Multiplet Upcycling enables the conversion of any dense CLIP model into CLIP-MoEs, which can seamlessly replace CLIP in a plug-and-play manner without requiring further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Through Diversified Multiplet Upcycling, we aim to provide valuable insights for future research on developing more efficient and effective multimodal learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theofanis Ganitidis, Maria Athanasiou, Konstantinos Mitsis, Konstantia Zarkogianni, Konstantina S. Nikita</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust diagnostic tools capable of detecting the disease from diverse and evolving data sources. Machine learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data can lead to model drift, where performance degrades over time as the underlying data distribution changes. Addressing this challenge is crucial to maintaining accuracy and reliability in diagnostic applications.
  Objective: This study aims to develop a framework that monitors model drift and employs adaptation mechanisms to mitigate performance fluctuations in COVID-19 detection models trained on dynamic audio data.
  Methods: Two crowd-sourced COVID-19 audio datasets, COVID-19 Sounds and COSWARA, were used. Each was divided into development and post-development periods. A baseline CNN model was trained and evaluated using cough recordings from the development period. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) was used to detect changes in data distributions and model performance between periods. Upon detecting drift, retraining was triggered to update the baseline model. Two adaptation approaches were compared: unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and active learning (AL).
  Results: UDA improved balanced accuracy by up to 22% and 24% for the COVID-19 Sounds and COSWARA datasets, respectively. AL yielded even greater improvements, with increases of up to 30% and 60%, respectively.
  Conclusions: The proposed framework addresses model drift in COVID-19 detection, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data. This approach ensures sustained model performance, contributing to robust diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and potentially other infectious diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Zhu, Liyuan Huang, Zhenping Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm proposed for privacy preservation. Unlike traditional centralized learning approaches, FL enables multiple users to collaboratively train a shared global model without disclosing their own data, thereby significantly reducing the potential risk of privacy leakage. However, recent studies have indicated that FL cannot entirely guarantee privacy protection, and attackers may still be able to extract users' private data through the communicated model gradients. Although numerous privacy attack FL algorithms have been developed, most are designed to reconstruct private data from a single step of calculated gradients. It remains uncertain whether these methods are effective in realistic federated environments or if they have other limitations. In this paper, we aim to help researchers better understand and evaluate the effectiveness of privacy attacks on FL. We analyze and discuss recent research papers on this topic and conduct experiments in a real FL environment to compare the performance of various attack methods. Our experimental results reveal that none of the existing state-of-the-art privacy attack algorithms can effectively breach private client data in realistic FL settings, even in the absence of defense strategies. This suggests that privacy attacks in FL are more challenging than initially anticipated.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced facial recognition technologies and recommender systems with inadequate privacy technologies and policies for facial interactions increase concerns about bioprivacy violations. With the proliferation of video and live-streaming websites, public-face video distribution and interactions pose greater privacy risks. Existing techniques typically address the risk of sensitive biometric information leakage through various privacy enhancement methods but pose a higher security risk by corrupting the information to be conveyed by the interaction data, or by leaving certain biometric features intact that allow an attacker to infer sensitive biometric information from them. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a neural network framework, CausalVE. We obtain cover images by adopting a diffusion model to achieve face swapping with face guidance and use the speech sequence features and spatiotemporal sequence features of the secret video for dynamic video inference and prediction to obtain a cover video with the same number of frames as the secret video. In addition, we hide the secret video by using reversible neural networks for video hiding so that the video can also disseminate secret data. Numerous experiments prove that our CausalVE has good security in public video dissemination and outperforms state-of-the-art methods from a qualitative, quantitative, and visual point of view.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing across diverse fields, yet their general-purpose design limits their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as simulating opinions on environmental policies. This paper presents an approach for fine-tuning LLMs using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, improving the accuracy of opinion generation by conditioning models on socio-demographic factors like age, income, education, and region. By emulating diverse synthetic profiles, fine-tuned models capture the subtle differences across demographic groups more effectively than pre-trained versions. Metrics such as Chi-Squared, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Index, and KL-divergence, demonstrate a strong alignment between synthetic and real-world opinion data. This approach highlights the potential of fine-tuning LLMs to provide more informed, representative, and ethical insights into public sentiments on environmental issues. The findings underscore the importance of tailoring LLMs to specific societal contexts for more accurate and ethical policy simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Gilkarov, Ran Dubin</p>
<p>Abstract: The potential for exploitation of AI models has increased due to the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the widespread use of platforms like Model Zoo for sharing AI models. Attackers can embed malware within AI models through steganographic techniques, taking advantage of the substantial size of these models to conceal malicious data and use it for nefarious purposes, e.g. Remote Code Execution. Ensuring the security of AI models is a burgeoning area of research essential for safeguarding the multitude of organizations and users relying on AI technologies. This study leverages well-studied image few-shot learning techniques by transferring the AI models to the image field using a novel image representation. Applying few-shot learning in this field enables us to create practical models, a feat that previous works lack. Our method addresses critical limitations in state-of-the-art detection techniques that hinder their practicality. This approach reduces the required training dataset size from 40000 models to just 6. Furthermore, our methods consistently detect delicate attacks of up to 25% embedding rate and even up to 6% in some cases, while previous works were only shown to be effective for a 100%-50% embedding rate. We employ a strict evaluation strategy to ensure the trained models are generic concerning various factors. In addition, we show that our trained models successfully detect novel spread-spectrum steganography attacks, demonstrating the models' impressive robustness just by learning one type of attack. We open-source our code to support reproducibility and enhance the research in this new field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer neural networks, driven by self-attention mechanisms, are core components of foundational and Large Language Models. In generative transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks for long sequences. In this work, we propose a fast and energy-efficient hardware implementation of self-attention using analog in-memory computing based on gain cell memories. Volatile gain cell memories can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation, while performing analog signed weight multiplications to compute the dot-products required for self-attention. We implement Sliding Window Attention, which keeps memory of a finite set of past steps. A charge-to-pulse converter for array readout eliminates the need for analog-to-digital conversion between self-attention stages. Using a co-designed initialization algorithm to adapt pre-trained weights to gain cell non-idealities, we achieve NLP performance comparable to ChatGPT-2 with minimal training iterations, despite hardware constraints. Our end-to-end hardware design includes digital controls, estimating area, latency, and energy. The system reduces attention latency by up to two orders of magnitude and energy consumption by up to five orders compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power sequence generation in Large Language Models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Potito Aghilar, Vito Walter Anelli, Michelantonio Trizio, Tommaso Di Noia</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, 3D models have gained popularity in various fields, including entertainment, manufacturing, and simulation. However, manually creating these models can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, making it impractical for large-scale industrial applications. To address this issue, researchers are exploiting Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to automatically generate 3D models effortlessly. In this paper, we present a novel cloud-native pipeline that can automatically reconstruct 3D models from monocular 2D images captured using a smartphone camera. Our goal is to provide an efficient and easily-adoptable solution that meets the Industry 4.0 standards for creating a Digital Twin model, which could enhance personnel expertise through accelerated training. We leverage machine learning models developed by NVIDIA Research Labs alongside a custom-designed pose recorder with a unique pose compensation component based on the ARCore framework by Google. Our solution produces a reusable 3D model, with embedded materials and textures, exportable and customizable in any external 3D modelling software or 3D engine. Furthermore, the whole workflow is implemented by adopting the microservices architecture standard, enabling each component of the pipeline to operate as a standalone replaceable module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuding Duan, Jiyi Li, Yukino Baba, Hisashi Kashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Intransitivity is a critical issue in pairwise preference modeling. It refers to the intransitive pairwise preferences between a group of players or objects that potentially form a cyclic preference chain and has been long discussed in social choice theory in the context of the dominance relationship. However, such multifaceted intransitivity between players and the corresponding player representations in high dimensions is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that jointly learns each player's d-dimensional representation (d>1) and a dataset-specific metric space that systematically captures the distance metric in Rd over the embedding space. Interestingly, by imposing additional constraints in the metric space, our proposed model degenerates to former models used in intransitive representation learning. Moreover, we present an extensive quantitative investigation of the vast existence of intransitive relationships between objects in various real-world benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this investigation is the first of this type. The predictive performance of our proposed method on different real-world datasets, including social choice, election, and online game datasets, shows that our proposed method outperforms several competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Wei Zhao, Yingli Li, Tianyang Zhong, Yisong Wang, Youlan Shang, Lei Guo, Junwei Han, Tianming Liu, Jun Liu, Tuo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image analysis is crucial in modern radiological diagnostics, especially given the exponential growth in medical imaging data. The demand for automated report generation systems has become increasingly urgent. While prior research has mainly focused on using machine learning and multimodal language models for 2D medical images, the generation of reports for 3D medical images has been less explored due to data scarcity and computational complexities. This paper introduces 3D-CT-GPT, a Visual Question Answering (VQA)-based medical visual language model specifically designed for generating radiology reports from 3D CT scans, particularly chest CTs. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that 3D-CT-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of report accuracy and quality. Although current methods are few, including the partially open-source CT2Rep and the open-source M3D, we ensured fair comparison through appropriate data conversion and evaluation methodologies. Experimental results indicate that 3D-CT-GPT enhances diagnostic accuracy and report coherence, establishing itself as a robust solution for clinical radiology report generation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and further optimizing the model to enhance its performance and applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Zhang, Jianzhe Liu, Zhen Han, Shuo Chen, Bailan He, Volker Tresp, Zhiqiang Xu, Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Question decomposition has emerged as an effective strategy for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer complex questions. However, while existing methods primarily focus on unimodal language models, the question decomposition capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has yet to be explored. To this end, this paper explores visual question decomposition on MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework including a dataset and several evaluation criteria to assess the quality of the decomposed sub-questions, revealing that existing MLLMs struggle to produce high-quality sub-questions. To address this limitation, we propose a specific finetuning dataset, DecoVQA+, for enhancing the model's question decomposition capability. Aiming at enabling models to perform appropriate selective decomposition, we propose an efficient finetuning pipeline. The finetuning pipeline consists of our proposed dataset and a training objective for selective decomposition. Finetuned MLLMs demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of sub-questions and the policy of selective question decomposition. Additionally, the models also achieve higher accuracy with selective decomposition on VQA benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Lei, Kanghon Lee, Linjing Li, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The offline datasets for imitation learning (IL) in multi-agent games typically contain player trajectories exhibiting diverse strategies, which necessitate measures to prevent learning algorithms from acquiring undesirable behaviors. Learning representations for these trajectories is an effective approach to depicting the strategies employed by each demonstrator. However, existing learning strategies often require player identification or rely on strong assumptions, which are not appropriate for multi-agent games. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Strategy Representation for Imitation Learning (STRIL) framework, which (1) effectively learns strategy representations in multi-agent games, (2) estimates proposed indicators based on these representations, and (3) filters out sub-optimal data using the indicators. STRIL is a plug-in method that can be integrated into existing IL algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STRIL across competitive multi-agent scenarios, including Two-player Pong, Limit Texas Hold'em, and Connect Four. Our approach successfully acquires strategy representations and indicators, thereby identifying dominant trajectories and significantly enhancing existing IL performance across these environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conditional image synthesis based on user-specified requirements is a key component in creating complex visual content. In recent years, diffusion-based generative modeling has become a highly effective way for conditional image synthesis, leading to exponential growth in the literature. However, the complexity of diffusion-based modeling, the wide range of image synthesis tasks, and the diversity of conditioning mechanisms present significant challenges for researchers to keep up with rapid developments and understand the core concepts on this topic. In this survey, we categorize existing works based on how conditions are integrated into the two fundamental components of diffusion-based modeling, i.e., the denoising network and the sampling process. We specifically highlight the underlying principles, advantages, and potential challenges of various conditioning approaches in the training, re-purposing, and specialization stages to construct a desired denoising network. We also summarize six mainstream conditioning mechanisms in the essential sampling process. All discussions are centered around popular applications. Finally, we pinpoint some critical yet still open problems to be solved in the future and suggest some possible solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Liu, Zhaorui Tan, Haochuan Jiang, Xi Yang, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is often based on multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, in clinical practice, certain modalities of MRI may be missing, which presents an even more difficult scenario. To cope with this challenge, knowledge distillation has emerged as one promising strategy. However, recent efforts typically overlook the modality gaps and thus fail to learn invariant feature representations across different modalities. Such drawback consequently leads to limited performance for both teachers and students. To ameliorate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that aligns latent features of involved modalities to a well-defined distribution anchor. As a major contribution, we prove that our novel training paradigm ensures a tight evidence lower bound, thus theoretically certifying its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on different backbones validate that the proposed paradigm can enable invariant feature representations and produce a teacher with narrowed modality gaps. This further offers superior guidance for missing modality students, achieving an average improvement of 1.75 on dice score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Junfan Li, Qinghua Hu, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models may be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and test data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising approach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide the classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a limited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time catastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples, Dota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the model to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions based on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the adaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop paradigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and incorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that Dota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Why do security cameras, sensors, and siri use cloud servers instead of on-board computation? The lack of very-low-power, high-performance chips greatly limits the ability to field untethered edge devices. We present the NV-1, a new low-power ASIC AI processor that greatly accelerates parallel processing (> 10X) with dramatic reduction in energy consumption (> 100X), via many parallel combined processor-memory units, i.e., a drastically non-von-Neumann architecture, allowing very large numbers of independent processing streams without bottlenecks due to typical monolithic memory. The current initial prototype fab arises from a successful co-development effort between algorithm- and software-driven architectural design and VLSI design realities. An innovative communication protocol minimizes power usage, and data transport costs among nodes were vastly reduced by eliminating the address bus, through local target address matching. Throughout the development process, the software and architecture teams were able to innovate alongside the circuit design team's implementation effort. A digital twin of the proposed hardware was developed early on to ensure that the technical implementation met the architectural specifications, and indeed the predicted performance metrics have now been thoroughly verified in real hardware test data. The resulting device is currently being used in a fielded edge sensor application; additional proofs of principle are in progress demonstrating the proof on the ground of this new real-world extremely low-power high-performance ASIC device.</p>

<p>Abstract: The fifth-generation (5G) offers advanced services, supporting applications such as intelligent transportation, connected healthcare, and smart cities within the Internet of Things (IoT). However, these advancements introduce significant security challenges, with increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) using federated learning and large language models (LLMs). The core of our IDS is based on BERT, a transformer model adapted to identify malicious network flows. We modified this transformer to optimize performance on edge devices with limited resources. Experiments were conducted in both centralized and federated learning contexts. In the centralized setup, the model achieved an inference accuracy of 97.79%. In a federated learning context, the model was trained across multiple devices using both IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and non-IID data, based on various scenarios, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations. We also leveraged linear quantization to compress the model for deployment on edge devices. This reduction resulted in a slight decrease of 0.02% in accuracy for a model size reduction of 28.74%. The results underscore the viability of LLMs for deployment in IoT ecosystems, highlighting their ability to operate on devices with constrained computational and storage resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Brain-JEPA, a brain dynamics foundation model with the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: Brain Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Li, Gorka Abad, Stjepan Picek, Mauro Conti</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), commonly mimicking neurons with non-linear functions to output floating-point numbers, consistently receive the same signals of a data point during its forward time. Unlike ANNs, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) get various input signals in the forward time of a data point and simulate neurons in a biologically plausible way, i.e., producing a spike (a binary value) if the accumulated membrane potential of a neuron is larger than a threshold. Even though ANNs have achieved remarkable success in multiple tasks, e.g., face recognition and object detection, SNNs have recently obtained attention due to their low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven properties. While privacy threats against ANNs are widely explored, much less work has been done on SNNs. For instance, it is well-known that ANNs are vulnerable to the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), but whether the same applies to SNNs is not explored.
  In this paper, we evaluate the membership privacy of SNNs by considering eight MIAs, seven of which are inspired by MIAs against ANNs. Our evaluation results show that SNNs are more vulnerable (maximum 10% higher in terms of balanced attack accuracy) than ANNs when both are trained with neuromorphic datasets (with time dimension). On the other hand, when training ANNs or SNNs with static datasets (without time dimension), the vulnerability depends on the dataset used. If we convert ANNs trained with static datasets to SNNs, the accuracy of MIAs drops (maximum 11.5% with a reduction of 7.6% on the test accuracy of the target model). Next, we explore the impact factors of MIAs on SNNs by conducting a hyperparameter study. Finally, we show that the basic data augmentation method for static data and two recent data augmentation methods for neuromorphic data can considerably (maximum reduction of 25.7%) decrease MIAs' performance on SNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Li, Marco Arazzi, Antonino Nocera, Mauro Conti</p>
<p>Abstract: Source Inference Attack (SIA) in Federated Learning (FL) aims to identify which client used a target data point for local model training. It allows the central server to audit clients' data usage. In cross-silo FL, a client (silo) collects data from multiple subjects (e.g., individuals, writers, or devices), posing a risk of subject information leakage. Subject Membership Inference Attack (SMIA) targets this scenario and attempts to infer whether any client utilizes data points from a target subject in cross-silo FL. However, existing results on SMIA are limited and based on strong assumptions on the attack scenario. Therefore, we propose a Subject-Level Source Inference Attack (SLSIA) by removing critical constraints that only one client can use a target data point in SIA and imprecise detection of clients utilizing target subject data in SMIA. The attacker, positioned on the server side, controls a target data source and aims to detect all clients using data points from the target subject. Our strategy leverages a binary attack classifier to predict whether the embeddings returned by a local model on test data from the target subject include unique patterns that indicate a client trains the model with data from that subject. To achieve this, the attacker locally pre-trains models using data derived from the target subject and then leverages them to build a training set for the binary attack classifier. Our SLSIA significantly outperforms previous methods on three datasets. Specifically, SLSIA achieves a maximum average accuracy of 0.88 over 50 target subjects. Analyzing embedding distribution and input feature distance shows that datasets with sparse subjects are more susceptible to our attack. Finally, we propose to defend our SLSIA using item-level and subject-level differential privacy mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagar Shrestha, Subash Timilsina, Xiao Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: A core task in multi-modal learning is to integrate information from multiple feature spaces (e.g., text and audio), offering modality-invariant essential representations of data. Recent research showed that, classical tools such as {\it canonical correlation analysis} (CCA) provably identify the shared components up to minor ambiguities, when samples in each modality are generated from a linear mixture of shared and private components. Such identifiability results were obtained under the condition that the cross-modality samples are aligned/paired according to their shared information. This work takes a step further, investigating shared component identifiability from multi-modal linear mixtures where cross-modality samples are unaligned. A distribution divergence minimization-based loss is proposed, under which a suite of sufficient conditions ensuring identifiability of the shared components are derived. Our conditions are based on cross-modality distribution discrepancy characterization and density-preserving transform removal, which are much milder than existing studies relying on independent component analysis. More relaxed conditions are also provided via adding reasonable structural constraints, motivated by available side information in various applications. The identifiability claims are thoroughly validated using synthetic and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Carnelos, Francesco Pasti, Nicola Bellotto</p>
<p>Abstract: MicroFlow is an open-source TinyML framework for the deployment of Neural Networks (NNs) on embedded systems using the Rust programming language, specifically designed for efficiency and robustness, which is suitable for applications in critical environments. To achieve these objectives, MicroFlow employs a compiler-based inference engine approach, coupled with Rust's memory safety and features. The proposed solution enables the successful deployment of NNs on highly resource-constrained devices, including bare-metal 8-bit microcontrollers with only 2kB of RAM. Furthermore, MicroFlow is able to use less Flash and RAM memory than other state-of-the-art solutions for deploying NN reference models (i.e. wake-word and person detection). It can also achieve faster inference compared to existing engines on medium-size NNs, and similar performance on bigger ones. The experimental results prove the efficiency and suitability of MicroFlow for the deployment of TinyML models in critical environments where resources are particularly limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Chen, Yue Song, Rui Wang, Xiaojun Wu, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Riemannian neural networks, which extend deep learning techniques to Riemannian spaces, have gained significant attention in machine learning. To better classify the manifold-valued features, researchers have started extending Euclidean multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian manifolds. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due to their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper proposes a framework for designing Riemannian MLR over general geometries, referred to as RMLR. Our framework only requires minimal geometric properties, thus exhibiting broad applicability and enabling its use with a wide range of geometries. Specifically, we showcase our framework on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and special orthogonal group, i.e., the set of rotation matrices. On the SPD manifold, we develop five families of SPD MLRs under five types of power-deformed metrics. On rotation matrices we propose Lie MLR based on the popular bi-invariant metric. Extensive experiments on different Riemannian backbone networks validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb Ju, Guanghui Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning lacks a principled measure of optimality, causing research to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality. Focusing on finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP), we develop a simple, computable gap function that provides both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap. Therefore, convergence of the gap function is a stronger mode of convergence than convergence of the optimality gap, and it is equivalent to a new notion we call distribution-free convergence, where convergence is independent of any problem-dependent distribution. We show the basic policy mirror descent exhibits fast distribution-free convergence for both the deterministic and stochastic setting. We leverage the distribution-free convergence to a uncover a couple new results. First, the deterministic policy mirror descent can solve unregularized MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. Second, accuracy estimates can be obtained with no additional samples while running stochastic policy mirror descent and can be used as a termination criteria, which can be verified in the validation step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulhady Abas Abdullah, Aram Mahmood Ahmed, Tarik Rashid, Hadi Veisi, Yassin Hussein Rassul, Bryar Hassan, Polla Fattah, Sabat Abdulhameed Ali, Ahmed S. Shamsaldin</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech signal processing is a cornerstone of modern communication technologies, tasked with improving the clarity and comprehensibility of audio data in noisy environments. The primary challenge in this field is the effective separation and recognition of speech from background noise, crucial for applications ranging from voice-activated assistants to automated transcription services. The quality of speech recognition directly impacts user experience and accessibility in technology-driven communication. This review paper explores advanced clustering techniques, particularly focusing on the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) method, to address these challenges. Our findings indicate that KFCM, compared to traditional methods like K-Means (KM) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), provides superior performance in handling non-linear and non-stationary noise conditions in speech signals. The most notable outcome of this review is the adaptability of KFCM to various noisy environments, making it a robust choice for speech enhancement applications. Additionally, the paper identifies gaps in current methodologies, such as the need for more dynamic clustering algorithms that can adapt in real time to changing noise conditions without compromising speech recognition quality. Key contributions include a detailed comparative analysis of current clustering algorithms and suggestions for further integrating hybrid models that combine KFCM with neural networks to enhance speech recognition accuracy. Through this review, we advocate for a shift towards more sophisticated, adaptive clustering techniques that can significantly improve speech enhancement and pave the way for more resilient speech processing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiping Zhang, Chenxinran Shen, Bingsheng Yao, Dakuo Wang, Tianshi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have decentralized the responsibility for the transparency of AI usage. Specifically, LLM users are now encouraged or required to disclose the use of LLM-generated content for varied types of real-world tasks. However, an emerging phenomenon, users' secret use of LLM, raises challenges in ensuring end users adhere to the transparency requirement. Our study used mixed-methods with an exploratory survey (125 real-world secret use cases reported) and a controlled experiment among 300 users to investigate the contexts and causes behind the secret use of LLMs. We found that such secretive behavior is often triggered by certain tasks, transcending demographic and personality differences among users. Task types were found to affect users' intentions to use secretive behavior, primarily through influencing perceived external judgment regarding LLM usage. Our results yield important insights for future work on designing interventions to encourage more transparent disclosure of the use of LLMs or other AI technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Gang Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Losing track of reading progress during line switching can be frustrating. Eye gaze tracking technology offers a potential solution by highlighting read paragraphs, aiding users in avoiding wrong line switches. However, the gap between gaze tracking accuracy (2-3 cm) and text line spacing (3-5 mm) makes direct application impractical. Existing methods leverage the linear reading pattern but fail during jump reading. This paper presents a reading tracking and highlighting system that supports both linear and jump reading. Based on experimental insights from the gaze nature study of 16 users, two gaze error models are designed to enable both jump reading detection and relocation. The system further leverages the large language model's contextual perception capability in aiding reading tracking. A reading tracking domain-specific line-gaze alignment opportunity is also exploited to enable dynamic and frequent calibration of the gaze results. Controlled experiments demonstrate reliable linear reading tracking, as well as 84% accuracy in tracking jump reading. Furthermore, real field tests with 18 volunteers demonstrated the system's effectiveness in tracking and highlighting read paragraphs, improving reading efficiency, and enhancing user experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medication Extraction and Mining play an important role in healthcare NLP research due to its practical applications in hospital settings, such as their mapping into standard clinical knowledge bases (SNOMED-CT, BNF, etc.). In this work, we investigate state-of-the-art LLMs in text mining tasks on medications and their related attributes such as dosage, route, strength, and adverse effects. In addition, we explore different ensemble learning methods (\textsc{Stack-Ensemble} and \textsc{Voting-Ensemble}) to augment the model performances from individual LLMs. Our ensemble learning result demonstrated better performances than individually fine-tuned base models BERT, RoBERTa, RoBERTa-L, BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, BioMedRoBERTa, ClinicalBERT, and PubMedBERT across general and specific domains. Finally, we build up an entity linking function to map extracted medical terminologies into the SNOMED-CT codes and the British National Formulary (BNF) codes, which are further mapped to the Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d), and ICD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Wu, Zikang Xiong, Yiran Hu, Shreyash S. Iyengar, Nan Jiang, Aniket Bera, Lin Tan, Suresh Jagannathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) that enhance robot agents' understanding and execution of natural language (NL) commands, ensuring the agents adhere to user-specified constraints remains challenging, particularly for complex commands and long-horizon tasks. To address this challenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained decoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM planners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures consistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the majority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then uses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific fine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific task domains. Our approach, Safe Efficient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these insights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands with high confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and robot manipulation. For drone navigation tasks, SELP outperforms state-of-the-art planners by 10.8% in safety rate (i.e., finishing tasks conforming to NL commands) and by 19.8% in plan efficiency. For robot manipulation tasks, SELP achieves 20.4% improvement in safety rate. Our datasets for evaluating NL-to-LTL and robot task planning will be released in github.com/lt-asset/selp.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements and pervasive use of vision-language models, a paucity of studies has addressed their ethical implications. These models typically require extensive training data, often from hastily reviewed text and image datasets, leading to highly imbalanced datasets and ethical concerns. Additionally, models initially trained in English are frequently fine-tuned for other languages, such as the CLIP model, which can be expanded with more data to enhance capabilities but can add new biases. The CAPIVARA, a CLIP-based model adapted to Portuguese, has shown strong performance in zero-shot tasks. In this paper, we evaluate four different types of discriminatory practices within visual-language models and introduce FairPIVARA, a method to reduce them by removing the most affected dimensions of feature embeddings. The application of FairPIVARA has led to a significant reduction of up to 98% in observed biases while promoting a more balanced word distribution within the model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shu Ishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can perform complex tasks with long-term objectives by planning, reasoning, and forecasting outcomes of actions. For embodied agents to achieve similar capabilities, they must gain knowledge of the environment transferable to novel scenarios with a limited budget of additional trial and error. Learning-based approaches, such as deep RL, can discover and take advantage of inherent regularities and characteristics of the application domain from data, and continuously improve their performances, however at a cost of large amounts of training data. This thesis explores the development of data-driven techniques for spatial reasoning and planning tasks, focusing on enhancing learning efficiency, interpretability, and transferability across novel scenarios. Four key contributions are made. 1) CALVIN, a differential planner that learns interpretable models of the world for long-term planning. It successfully navigated partially observable 3D environments, such as mazes and indoor rooms, by learning the rewards and state transitions from expert demonstrations. 2) SOAP, an RL algorithm that discovers options unsupervised for long-horizon tasks. Options segment a task into subtasks and enable consistent execution of the subtask. SOAP showed robust performances on history-conditional corridor tasks as well as classical benchmarks such as Atari. 3) LangProp, a code optimisation framework using LLMs to solve embodied agent problems that require reasoning by treating code as learnable policies. The framework successfully generated interpretable code with comparable or superior performance to human-written experts in the CARLA autonomous driving benchmark. 4) Voggite, an embodied agent with a vision-to-action transformer backend that solves complex tasks in Minecraft. It achieved third place in the MineRL BASALT Competition by identifying action triggers to segment tasks into multiple stages.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language understanding and generation have not rendered them immune to hallucinations. LLMs can still generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or fabricated information. As LLM-empowered chatbots become popular, laypeople may frequently ask health-related queries and risk falling victim to these LLM hallucinations, resulting in various societal and healthcare implications. In this work, we conduct a pioneering study of hallucinations in LLM-generated responses to real-world healthcare queries from patients. We propose MedHalu, a carefully crafted first-of-its-kind medical hallucination dataset with a diverse range of health-related topics and the corresponding hallucinated responses from LLMs with labeled hallucination types and hallucinated text spans. We also introduce MedHaluDetect framework to evaluate capabilities of various LLMs in detecting hallucinations. We also employ three groups of evaluators -- medical experts, LLMs, and laypeople -- to study who are more vulnerable to these medical hallucinations. We find that LLMs are much worse than the experts. They also perform no better than laypeople and even worse in few cases in detecting hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose expert-in-the-loop approach to improve hallucination detection through LLMs by infusing expert reasoning. We observe significant performance gains for all the LLMs with an average macro-F1 improvement of 6.3 percentage points for GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Xu, Hieu Le, Zhixin Shu, Yang Wang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Human emotional expression is inherently dynamic, complex, and fluid, characterized by smooth transitions in intensity throughout verbal communication. However, the modeling of such intensity fluctuations has been largely overlooked by previous audio-driven talking-head generation methods, which often results in static emotional outputs. In this paper, we explore how emotion intensity fluctuates during speech, proposing a method for capturing and generating these subtle shifts for talking-head generation. Specifically, we develop a talking-head framework that is capable of generating a variety of emotions with precise control over intensity levels. This is achieved by learning a continuous emotion latent space, where emotion types are encoded within latent orientations and emotion intensity is reflected in latent norms. In addition, to capture the dynamic intensity fluctuations, we adopt an audio-to-intensity predictor by considering the speaking tone that reflects the intensity. The training signals for this predictor are obtained through our emotion-agnostic intensity pseudo-labeling method without the need of frame-wise intensity labeling. Extensive experiments and analyses validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in accurately capturing and reproducing emotion intensity fluctuations in talking-head generation, thereby significantly enhancing the expressiveness and realism of the generated outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhidong Gao, Yu Zhang, Yanmin Gong, Yuanxiong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving framework for training machine learning models on mobile edge devices. Traditional FL algorithms, e.g., FedAvg, impose a heavy communication workload on these devices. To mitigate this issue, Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HFEL) has been proposed, leveraging edge servers as intermediaries for model aggregation. Despite its effectiveness, HFEL encounters challenges such as a slow convergence rate and high resource consumption, particularly in the presence of system and data heterogeneity. However, existing works are mainly focused on improving training efficiency for traditional FL, leaving the efficiency of HFEL largely unexplored. In this paper, we consider a two-tier HFEL system, where edge devices are connected to edge servers and edge servers are interconnected through peer-to-peer (P2P) edge backhauls. Our goal is to enhance the training efficiency of the HFEL system through strategic resource allocation and topology design. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total training latency by allocating the computation and communication resources, as well as adjusting the P2P connections. To ensure convergence under dynamic topologies, we analyze the convergence error bound and introduce a model consensus constraint into the optimization problem. The proposed problem is then decomposed into several subproblems, enabling us to alternatively solve it online. Our method facilitates the efficient implementation of large-scale FL at edge networks under data and system heterogeneity. Comprehensive experiment evaluation on benchmark datasets validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant reductions in training latency while maintaining the model accuracy compared to various baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) training often necessitates gathering raw user data on a central server, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated learning emerges as a solution, enabling collaborative model training without users directly sharing their raw data. However, integrating federated learning with GNNs presents unique challenges, especially when a client represents a graph node and holds merely a single feature vector. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for node-level federated graph learning. Specifically, we decouple the message-passing and feature vector transformation processes of the first GNN layer, allowing them to be executed separately on the user devices and the cloud server. Moreover, we introduce a graph Laplacian term based on the feature vector's latent representation to regulate the user-side model updates. The experiment results on multiple datasets show that our approach achieves better performance compared with baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Singh, Ashish Singh, Tales Imbiriba, Deniz Erdogmus, Ricardo Borsoi</p>
<p>Abstract: Approaches based on Koopman operators have shown great promise in forecasting time series data generated by complex nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS). Although such approaches are able to capture the latent state representation of a NLDS, they still face difficulty in long term forecasting when applied to real world data. Specifically many real-world NLDS exhibit time-varying behavior, leading to nonstationarity that is hard to capture with such models. Furthermore they lack a systematic data-driven approach to perform data assimilation, that is, exploiting noisy measurements on the fly in the forecasting task. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a Koopman operator-based approach (named KODA - Koopman Operator with Data Assimilation) that integrates forecasting and data assimilation in NLDS. In particular we use a Fourier domain filter to disentangle the data into a physical component whose dynamics can be accurately represented by a Koopman operator, and residual dynamics that represents the local or time varying behavior that are captured by a flexible and learnable recursive model. We carefully design an architecture and training criterion that ensures this decomposition lead to stable and long-term forecasts. Moreover, we introduce a course correction strategy to perform data assimilation with new measurements at inference time. The proposed approach is completely data-driven and can be learned end-to-end. Through extensive experimental comparisons we show that KODA outperforms existing state of the art methods on multiple time series benchmarks such as electricity, temperature, weather, lorenz 63 and duffing oscillator demonstrating its superior performance and efficacy along the three tasks a) forecasting, b) data assimilation and c) state prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuanrong Liu, Siyuan Liang, Jiawei Liang, Pengwen Dai, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning uses various data modalities to create high-quality features, but its reliance on extensive data sources on the Internet makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks insert malicious behaviors during training, which are activated by specific triggers during inference, posing significant security risks. Despite existing countermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the malicious impacts of such attacks, these defenses frequently necessitate extensive training time and degrade clean accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient defense mechanism against backdoor threats using a concept known as machine unlearning. This entails strategically creating a small set of poisoned samples to aid the model's rapid unlearning of backdoor vulnerabilities, known as Unlearn Backdoor Threats (UBT). We specifically use overfit training to improve backdoor shortcuts and accurately detect suspicious samples in the potential poisoning data set. Then, we select fewer unlearned samples from suspicious samples for rapid forgetting in order to eliminate the backdoor effect and thus improve backdoor defense efficiency. In the backdoor unlearning process, we present a novel token-based portion unlearning training regime. This technique focuses on the model's compromised elements, dissociating backdoor correlations while maintaining the model's overall integrity. Extensive experimental results show that our method effectively defends against various backdoor attack methods in the CLIP model. Compared to SoTA backdoor defense methods, UBT achieves the lowest attack success rate while maintaining a high clean accuracy of the model (attack success rate decreases by 19% compared to SOTA, while clean accuracy increases by 2.57%).</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the clinical decision-making processes in Traditional East Asian Medicine (TEAM) by reinterpreting pattern identification (PI) through the lens of dimensionality reduction. Focusing on the Eight Principle Pattern Identification (EPPI) system and utilizing empirical data from the Shang-Han-Lun, we explore the necessity and significance of prioritizing the Exterior-Interior pattern in diagnosis and treatment selection. We test three hypotheses: whether the Ext-Int pattern contains the most information about patient symptoms, represents the most abstract and generalizable symptom information, and facilitates the selection of appropriate herbal prescriptions. Employing quantitative measures such as the abstraction index, cross-conditional generalization performance, and decision tree regression, our results demonstrate that the Exterior-Interior pattern represents the most abstract and generalizable symptom information, contributing to the efficient mapping between symptom and herbal prescription spaces. This research provides an objective framework for understanding the cognitive processes underlying TEAM, bridging traditional medical practices with modern computational approaches. The findings offer insights into the development of AI-driven diagnostic tools in TEAM and conventional medicine, with the potential to advance clinical practice, education, and research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahed Masoudian, Markus Frohman, Navid Rekabsaz, Markus Schedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models frequently inherit societal biases from their training data. Numerous techniques have been proposed to mitigate these biases during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained debiased language model on a downstream task can reintroduce biases into the model. Additionally, existing debiasing methods for downstream tasks either (i) require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, race, or political views) that are often not available or (ii) rely on indicators of bias, which restricts their applicability to gender debiasing since they rely on gender-specific words. To address this, we introduce a novel debiasing regularization technique based on the class-wise variance of embeddings. Crucially, our method does not require attribute labels and targets any attribute, thus addressing the shortcomings of existing debiasing methods. Our experiments on encoder language models and three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong debiasing baselines that rely on target attribute labels while maintaining performance on the target task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubha R. Kharel, Fanchen Meng, Xiaohui Qu, Matthew R. Carbone, Deyu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful characterization technique for probing the local chemical environment of absorbing atoms. However, analyzing XAS data presents with significant challenges, often requiring extensive, computationally intensive simulations, as well as significant domain expertise. These limitations hinder the development of fast, robust XAS analysis pipelines that are essential in high-throughput studies and for autonomous experimentation. We address these challenges with a suite of transfer learning approaches for XAS prediction, each uniquely contributing to improved accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated on K-edge spectra database covering eight 3d transition metals (Ti-Cu). Our framework is built upon three distinct strategies. First, we use M3GNet to derive latent representations of the local chemical environment of absorption sites as input for XAS prediction, achieving up to order-of-magnitude improvements over conventional featurization techniques. Second, we employ a hierarchical transfer learning strategy, training a universal multi-task model across elements before fine-tuning for element-specific predictions. This cascaded approach after element-wise fine-turning yields models that outperform element-specific models by up to 31\%. Third, we implement cross-fidelity transfer learning, adapting a universal model to predict spectra generated by simulation of a different fidelity with a much higher computational cost. This approach improves prediction accuracy by up to 24\% over models trained on the target fidelity alone. Our approach is extendable to XAS prediction for a broader range of elements and offers a generalizable transfer learning framework to enhance other deep-learning models in materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Tan, Xun Gong, Yang Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in traditional person re-identification (ReID) tasks due to its inherent advantage in generating textual descriptions for pedestrian images. However, applying CLIP directly to intra-camera supervised person re-identification (ICS ReID) presents challenges. ICS ReID requires independent identity labeling within each camera, without associations across cameras. This limits the effectiveness of text-based enhancements. To address this, we propose a novel framework called CLIP-based Camera-Agnostic Feature Learning (CCAFL) for ICS ReID. Accordingly, two custom modules are designed to guide the model to actively learn camera-agnostic pedestrian features: Intra-Camera Discriminative Learning (ICDL) and Inter-Camera Adversarial Learning (ICAL). Specifically, we first establish learnable textual prompts for intra-camera pedestrian images to obtain crucial semantic supervision signals for subsequent intra- and inter-camera learning. Then, we design ICDL to increase inter-class variation by considering the hard positive and hard negative samples within each camera, thereby learning intra-camera finer-grained pedestrian features. Additionally, we propose ICAL to reduce inter-camera pedestrian feature discrepancies by penalizing the model's ability to predict the camera from which a pedestrian image originates, thus enhancing the model's capability to recognize pedestrians from different viewpoints. Extensive experiments on popular ReID datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Especially, on the challenging MSMT17 dataset, we arrive at 58.9\% in terms of mAP accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakash Dhakal, Daya Sagar Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic text summarization in Nepali language is an unexplored area in natural language processing (NLP). Although considerable research has been dedicated to extractive summarization, the area of abstractive summarization, especially for low-resource languages such as Nepali, remains largely unexplored. This study explores the use of multilingual transformer models, specifically mBART and mT5, for generating headlines for Nepali news articles through abstractive summarization. The research addresses key challenges associated with summarizing texts in Nepali by first creating a summarization dataset through web scraping from various Nepali news portals. These multilingual models were then fine-tuned using different strategies. The performance of the fine-tuned models were then assessed using ROUGE scores and human evaluation to ensure the generated summaries were coherent and conveyed the original meaning. During the human evaluation, the participants were asked to select the best summary among those generated by the models, based on criteria such as relevance, fluency, conciseness, informativeness, factual accuracy, and coverage. During the evaluation with ROUGE scores, the 4-bit quantized mBART with LoRA model was found to be effective in generating better Nepali news headlines in comparison to other models and also it was selected 34.05% of the time during the human evaluation, outperforming all other fine-tuned models created for Nepali News headline generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ante Wang, Linfeng Song, Zijun Min, Ge Xu, Xiaoli Wang, Junfeng Yao, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational query generation aims at producing search queries from dialogue histories, which are then used to retrieve relevant knowledge from a search engine to help knowledge-based dialogue systems. Trained to maximize the likelihood of gold queries, previous models suffer from the data hunger issue, and they tend to both drop important concepts from dialogue histories and generate irrelevant concepts at inference time. We attribute these issues to the over-association phenomenon where a large number of gold queries are indirectly related to the dialogue topics, because annotators may unconsciously perform reasoning with their background knowledge when generating these gold queries. We carefully analyze the negative effects of this phenomenon on pretrained Seq2seq query producers and then propose effective instance-level weighting strategies for training to mitigate these issues from multiple perspectives. Experiments on two benchmarks, Wizard-of-Internet and DuSinc, show that our strategies effectively alleviate the negative effects and lead to significant performance gains (2%-5% across automatic metrics and human evaluation). Further analysis shows that our model selects better concepts from dialogue histories and is 10 times more data efficient than the baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhang Liu, Zhenrong Zhang, Pengfei Hu, Jiefeng Ma, Jun Du, Qing Wang, Jianshu Zhang, Chenyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital era, the ability to understand visually rich documents that integrate text, complex layouts, and imagery is critical. Traditional Key Information Extraction (KIE) methods primarily rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which often introduces significant latency, computational overhead, and errors. Current advanced image-to-text approaches, which bypass OCR, typically yield plain text outputs without corresponding vision grounding. In this paper, we introduce STNet (See then Tell Net), a novel end-to-end model designed to deliver precise answers with relevant vision grounding. Distinctively, STNet utilizes a unique <see> token to observe pertinent image areas, aided by a decoder that interprets physical coordinates linked to this token. Positioned at the outset of the answer text, the <see> token allows the model to first see--observing the regions of the image related to the input question--and then tell--providing articulated textual responses. To enhance the model's seeing capabilities, we collect extensive structured table recognition datasets. Leveraging the advanced text processing prowess of GPT-4, we develop the TVG (TableQA with Vision Grounding) dataset, which not only provides text-based Question Answering (QA) pairs but also incorporates precise vision grounding for these pairs. Our approach demonstrates substantial advancements in KIE performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets such as CORD, SROIE, and DocVQA. The code will also be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingnan Zheng, Jiaohao Liu, An Zhang, Jun Zeng, Ziqi Yang, Zhenkai Liang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Android malware attacks have posed a severe threat to mobile users, necessitating a significant demand for the automated detection system. Among the various tools employed in malware detection, graph representations (e.g., function call graphs) have played a pivotal role in characterizing the behaviors of Android apps. However, though achieving impressive performance in malware detection, current state-of-the-art graph-based malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are meticulously crafted by introducing specific perturbations to normal malicious inputs. To defend against adversarial attacks, existing defensive mechanisms are typically supplementary additions to detectors and exhibit significant limitations, often relying on prior knowledge of adversarial examples and failing to defend against unseen types of attacks effectively. In this paper, we propose MASKDROID, a powerful detector with a strong discriminative ability to identify malware and remarkable robustness against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce a masking mechanism into the Graph Neural Network (GNN) based framework, forcing MASKDROID to recover the whole input graph using a small portion (e.g., 20%) of randomly selected nodes.This strategy enables the model to understand the malicious semantics and learn more stable representations, enhancing its robustness against adversarial attacks. While capturing stable malicious semantics in the form of dependencies inside the graph structures, we further employ a contrastive module to encourage MASKDROID to learn more compact representations for both the benign and malicious classes to boost its discriminative power in detecting malware from benign apps and adversarial examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Hu, Senlin Shu, Beibei Li, Tao Xiang, Zhongshi He</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning task, which assumes each training instance is annotated with a set of candidate labels containing the ground-truth label. Recent PLL methods adopt identification-based disambiguation to alleviate the influence of false positive labels and achieve promising performance. However, they require all classes in the test set to have appeared in the training set, ignoring the fact that new classes will keep emerging in real applications. To address this issue, in this paper, we focus on the problem of Partial Label Learning with Augmented Class (PLLAC), where one or more augmented classes are not visible in the training stage but appear in the inference stage. Specifically, we propose an unbiased risk estimator with theoretical guarantees for PLLAC, which estimates the distribution of augmented classes by differentiating the distribution of known classes from unlabeled data and can be equipped with arbitrary PLL loss functions. Besides, we provide a theoretical analysis of the estimation error bound of the estimator, which guarantees the convergence of the empirical risk minimizer to the true risk minimizer as the number of training data tends to infinity. Furthermore, we add a risk-penalty regularization term in the optimization objective to alleviate the influence of the over-fitting issue caused by negative empirical risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark, UCI and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Bai, Tong He, Haiyang Mei, Pichao Wang, Ziteng Gao, Joya Chen, Lei Liu, Zheng Zhang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce VideoLISA, a video-based multimodal large language model designed to tackle the problem of language-instructed reasoning segmentation in videos. Leveraging the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of large language models, and augmented by the Segment Anything Model, VideoLISA generates temporally consistent segmentation masks in videos based on language instructions. Existing image-based methods, such as LISA, struggle with video tasks due to the additional temporal dimension, which requires temporal dynamic understanding and consistent segmentation across frames. VideoLISA addresses these challenges by integrating a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy into the video-LLM, which balances temporal context and spatial detail within computational constraints. Additionally, we propose a One-Token-Seg-All approach using a specially designed <TRK> token, enabling the model to segment and track objects across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks, including our newly introduced ReasonVOS benchmark, demonstrate VideoLISA's superior performance in video object segmentation tasks involving complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object tracking. While optimized for videos, VideoLISA also shows promising generalization to image segmentation, revealing its potential as a unified foundation model for language-instructed object segmentation.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models, such as those used for face recognition and attribute prediction, are susceptible to manipulations like adversarial noise and unintentional noise, including Gaussian and impulse noise. This paper introduces CIAI, a Class-Independent Adversarial Intent detection network built on a modified vision transformer with detection layers. CIAI employs a novel loss function that combines Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Center Loss to detect both intentional (adversarial attacks) and unintentional noise, regardless of the image class. It is trained in a multi-step fashion. We also introduce the aspect of intent during detection that can act as an added layer of security. We further showcase the performance of our proposed detector on CelebA, CelebA-HQ, LFW, AgeDB, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our detector is able to detect both intentional (like FGSM, PGD, and DeepFool) and unintentional (like Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noises) perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Lu Li, Shuyan Wan, Sijie Wang, Zhiyi Wang, Zhiyuan Lu, Dong Hao, Wanli Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper discusses signed graphs, which model friendly or antagonistic relationships using edges marked with positive or negative signs, focusing on the task of link sign prediction. While Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have advanced, they face challenges like graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles. The authors propose using data augmentation (DA) techniques to address these issues, although many existing methods are not suitable for signed graphs due to a lack of side information. They highlight that the random DropEdge method, a rare DA approach applicable to signed graphs, does not enhance link sign prediction performance. In response, they introduce the Signed Graph Augmentation (SGA) framework, which includes a structure augmentation module to identify candidate edges and a strategy for selecting beneficial candidates, ultimately improving SGNN training. Experimental results show that SGA significantly boosts the performance of SGNN models, with a notable 32.3% improvement in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Kumar Trivedi, Bheeshm Sharma, P. Balamurugan</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting anomalies in brain MRI scans using supervised deep learning methods presents challenges due to anatomical diversity and labor-intensive requirement of pixel-level annotations. Generative models like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and their variants like pDDPM, mDDPM, cDDPM have recently emerged to be powerful alternatives to perform unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans. These methods leverage frame-level labels of healthy brains to generate healthy tissues in brain MRI scans. During inference, when an anomalous (or unhealthy) scan image is presented as an input, these models generate a healthy scan image corresponding to the input anomalous scan, and the difference map between the generated healthy scan image and the original anomalous scan image provide the necessary pixel level identification of abnormal tissues. The generated healthy images from the DDPM, pDDPM and mDDPM models however suffer from fidelity issues and contain artifacts that do not have medical significance. While cDDPM achieves slightly better fidelity and artifact suppression, it requires huge memory footprint and is computationally expensive than the other DDPM based models. In this work, we propose an improved version of DDPM called Multichannel Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MCDDPM) for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans. Our proposed model achieves high fidelity by making use of additional information from the healthy images during the training process, enriching the representation power of DDPM models, with a computational cost and memory requirements on par with DDPM, pDDPM and mDDPM models. Experimental results on multiple datasets (e.g. BraTS20, BraTS21) demonstrate promising performance of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/vivekkumartri/MCDDPM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have spurred significant interest in continuous story image generation. In this paper, we introduce Storynizor, a model capable of generating coherent stories with strong inter-frame character consistency, effective foreground-background separation, and diverse pose variation. The core innovation of Storynizor lies in its key modules: ID-Synchronizer and ID-Injector. The ID-Synchronizer employs an auto-mask self-attention module and a mask perceptual loss across inter-frame images to improve the consistency of character generation, vividly representing their postures and backgrounds. The ID-Injector utilize a Shuffling Reference Strategy (SRS) to integrate ID features into specific locations, enhancing ID-based consistent character generation. Additionally, to facilitate the training of Storynizor, we have curated a novel dataset called StoryDB comprising 100, 000 images. This dataset contains single and multiple-character sets in diverse environments, layouts, and gestures with detailed descriptions. Experimental results indicate that Storynizor demonstrates superior coherent story generation with high-fidelity character consistency, flexible postures, and vivid backgrounds compared to other character-specific methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a critical aspect of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), aimed at predicting the future state of a system to enable timely maintenance and prevent unexpected failures. While existing deep learning methods have shown promise, they often struggle to fully leverage the spatial information inherent in complex systems, limiting their effectiveness in RUL prediction. To address this challenge, recent research has explored the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model spatial information for more accurate RUL prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GNN techniques applied to RUL prediction, summarizing existing methods and offering guidance for future research. We first propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages of adapting GNNs to RUL prediction, systematically categorizing approaches into four key stages: graph construction, graph modeling, graph information processing, and graph readout. By organizing the field in this way, we highlight the unique challenges and considerations at each stage of the GNN pipeline. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation of various state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN methods, ensuring consistent experimental settings for fair comparisons. This rigorous analysis yields valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, serving as an experimental guide for researchers and practitioners working in this area. Finally, we identify and discuss several promising research directions that could further advance the field, emphasizing the potential for GNNs to revolutionize RUL prediction and enhance the effectiveness of PHM strategies.

<p>Abstract: Precise future human motion prediction over subsecond horizons from past observations is crucial for various safety-critical applications. To date, only one study has examined the vulnerability of human motion prediction to evasion attacks. In this paper, we propose BadHMP, the first backdoor attack that targets specifically human motion prediction. Our approach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized backdoor trigger in one arm of the skeleton, causing selected joints to remain relatively still or follow predefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences are globally modified to the target sequences, and the entire training dataset is traversed to select the most suitable samples for poisoning. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee the smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy enough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model unobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target sequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even with a low poisoned sample injection ratio. Experimental results on two datasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap) and two network architectures (LTD and HRI) demonstrate the high-fidelity, effectiveness, and stealthiness of BadHMP. Robustness of our attack against fine-tuning defense is also verified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Fang, Kaiyan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate dynamic modeling is critical for autonomous racing vehicles, especially during high-speed and agile maneuvers where precise motion prediction is essential for safety. Traditional parameter estimation methods face limitations such as reliance on initial guesses, labor-intensive fitting procedures, and complex testing setups. On the other hand, purely data-driven machine learning methods struggle to capture inherent physical constraints and typically require large datasets for optimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Fine-Tuning Hybrid Dynamics (FTHD) method, which integrates supervised and unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), combining physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques. FTHD fine-tunes a pre-trained Deep Dynamics Model (DDM) using a smaller training dataset, delivering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the Deep Pacejka Model (DPM) and outperforming the original DDM. Furthermore, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is embedded within FTHD (EKF-FTHD) to effectively manage noisy real-world data, ensuring accurate denoising while preserving the vehicle's essential physical characteristics. The proposed FTHD framework is validated through scaled simulations using the BayesRace Physics-based Simulator and full-scale real-world experiments from the Indy Autonomous Challenge. Results demonstrate that the hybrid approach significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy, even with reduced data, and outperforms existing models. EKF-FTHD enhances robustness by denoising real-world data while maintaining physical insights, representing a notable advancement in vehicle dynamics modeling for high-speed autonomous racing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuiyu Liu, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Hongchen Luo, Sen Liang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounding 3D scene affordance aims to locate interactive regions in 3D environments, which is crucial for embodied agents to interact intelligently with their surroundings. Most existing approaches achieve this by mapping semantics to 3D instances based on static geometric structure and visual appearance. This passive strategy limits the agent's ability to actively perceive and engage with the environment, making it reliant on predefined semantic instructions. In contrast, humans develop complex interaction skills by observing and imitating how others interact with their surroundings. To empower the model with such abilities, we introduce a novel task: grounding 3D scene affordance from egocentric interactions, where the goal is to identify the corresponding affordance regions in a 3D scene based on an egocentric video of an interaction. This task faces the challenges of spatial complexity and alignment complexity across multiple sources. To address these challenges, we propose the Egocentric Interaction-driven 3D Scene Affordance Grounding (Ego-SAG) framework, which utilizes interaction intent to guide the model in focusing on interaction-relevant sub-regions and aligns affordance features from different sources through a bidirectional query decoder mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce the Egocentric Video-3D Scene Affordance Dataset (VSAD), covering a wide range of common interaction types and diverse 3D environments to support this task. Extensive experiments on VSAD validate both the feasibility of the proposed task and the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-like personality traits have recently been discovered in large language models, raising the hypothesis that their (known and as yet undiscovered) biases conform with human latent psychological constructs. While large conversational models may be tricked into answering psychometric questionnaires, the latent psychological constructs of thousands of simpler transformers, trained for other tasks, cannot be assessed because appropriate psychometric methods are currently lacking. Here, we show how standard psychological questionnaires can be reformulated into natural language inference prompts, and we provide a code library to support the psychometric assessment of arbitrary models. We demonstrate, using a sample of 88 publicly available models, the existence of human-like mental health-related constructs (including anxiety, depression, and Sense of Coherence) which conform with standard theories in human psychology and show similar correlations and mitigation strategies. The ability to interpret and rectify the performance of language models by using psychological tools can boost the development of more explainable, controllable, and trustworthy models.</p>

However, there is a notable lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technology, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications have the potential to cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task, \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{E}diting \textbf{T}ype \textbf{I}dentification (KETI), aimed at identifying malicious edits in LLMs. As part of this task, we present KETIBench, a benchmark that includes five types of malicious updates and one type of benign update. Furthermore, we develop four classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, spanning 42 trials involving two models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all seven baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the efficacy of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources. All data and code are available in https://github.com/xpq-tech/KETI. Warning: This paper contains examples of toxic text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li, Weize Chen, Qizhi Chu, Haopeng Li, Zhaojun Sun, Ran Li, Chen Qian, Yiwei Wei, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun, Cheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The need to analyze graphs is ubiquitous across various fields, from social networks to biological research and recommendation systems. Therefore, enabling the ability of large language models (LLMs) to process graphs is an important step toward more advanced general intelligence. However, current LLM benchmarks on graph analysis require models to directly reason over the prompts describing graph topology, and are thus limited to small graphs with only a few dozens of nodes. In contrast, human experts typically write programs based on popular libraries for task solving, and can thus handle graphs with different scales. To this end, a question naturally arises: can LLMs analyze graphs like professionals? In this paper, we introduce ProGraph, a manually crafted benchmark containing 3 categories of graph tasks. The benchmark expects solutions based on programming instead of directly reasoning over raw inputs. Our findings reveal that the performance of current LLMs is unsatisfactory, with the best model achieving only 36% accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose LLM4Graph datasets, which include crawled documents and auto-generated codes based on 6 widely used graph libraries. By augmenting closed-source LLMs with document retrieval and fine-tuning open-source ones on the codes, we show 11-32% absolute improvements in their accuracies. Our results underscore that the capabilities of LLMs in handling structured data are still under-explored, and show the effectiveness of LLM4Graph in enhancing LLMs' proficiency of graph analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxin Zheng, Junzhong Ji, Yanzhao Shi, Xiaodan Zhang, Liangqiong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain CT report generation is significant to aid physicians in diagnosing cranial diseases. Recent studies concentrate on handling the consistency between visual and textual pathological features to improve the coherence of report. However, there exist some challenges: 1) Redundant visual representing: Massive irrelevant areas in 3D scans distract models from representing salient visual contexts. 2) Shifted semantic representing: Limited medical corpus causes difficulties for models to transfer the learned textual representations to generative layers. This study introduces a Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning (PCRL) model to build cross-modal representations based on pathological clues and naturally adapt them for accurate report generation. Specifically, we construct pathological clues from perspectives of segmented regions, pathological entities, and report themes, to fully grasp visual pathological patterns and learn cross-modal feature representations. To adapt the representations for the text generation task, we bridge the gap between representation learning and report generation by using a unified large language model (LLM) with task-tailored instructions. These crafted instructions enable the LLM to be flexibly fine-tuned across tasks and smoothly transfer the semantic representation for report generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves SoTA performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Chauncey-Jheng/PCRL-MRG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Li, Jiayi Shi, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction data is crucial for improving the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human-level performance. Recent research LIMA demonstrates that alignment is essentially a process where the model adapts instructions' interaction style or format to solve various tasks, leveraging pre-trained knowledge and skills. Therefore, for instructional data, the most important aspect is the task it represents, rather than the specific semantics and knowledge information. The latent representations of instructions play roles for some instruction-related tasks like data selection and demonstrations retrieval. However, they are always derived from text embeddings, encompass overall semantic information that influences the representation of task categories. In this work, we introduce a new concept, instruction embedding, and construct Instruction Embedding Benchmark (IEB) for its training and evaluation. Then, we propose a baseline Prompt-based Instruction Embedding (PIE) method to make the representations more attention on tasks. The evaluation of PIE, alongside other embedding methods on IEB with two designed tasks, demonstrates its superior performance in accurately identifying task categories. Moreover, the application of instruction embeddings in four downstream tasks showcases its effectiveness and suitability for instruction-related tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Zhou, Gang Chen, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Jeremy S. Rooney, Kirill Lagutin, Andrew MacKenzie, Keith C. Gordon, Daniel P. Killeen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid and accurate detection of biochemical compositions in fish is a crucial real-world task that facilitates optimal utilization and extraction of high-value products in the seafood industry. Raman spectroscopy provides a promising solution for quickly and non-destructively analyzing the biochemical composition of fish by associating Raman spectra with biochemical reference data using machine learning regression models. This paper investigates different regression models to address this task and proposes a new design of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for jointly predicting water, protein, and lipids yield. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a successful study employing CNNs to analyze the biochemical composition of fish based on a very small Raman spectroscopic dataset. Our approach combines a tailored CNN architecture with the comprehensive data preparation procedure, effectively mitigating the challenges posed by extreme data scarcity. The results demonstrate that our CNN can significantly outperform two state-of-the-art CNN models and multiple traditional machine learning models, paving the way for accurate and automated analysis of fish biochemical composition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the meaning of infant cries is a significant challenge for young parents in caring for their newborns. The presence of background noise and the lack of labeled data present practical challenges in developing systems that can detect crying and analyze its underlying reasons. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework, "InfantCryNet," for accomplishing these tasks. To address the issue of data scarcity, we employ pre-trained audio models to incorporate prior knowledge into our model. We propose the use of statistical pooling and multi-head attention pooling techniques to extract features more effectively. Additionally, knowledge distillation and model quantization are applied to enhance model efficiency and reduce the model size, better supporting industrial deployment in mobile devices. Experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 4.4% in classification accuracy. The model compression effectively reduces the model size by 7% without compromising performance and by up to 28% with only an 8% decrease in accuracy, offering practical insights for model selection and system design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baohe Zhang, Lilli Frison, Thomas Brox, Joschka B\"odecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a significant research area within RL, where integrating constraints with rewards is crucial for enhancing safety and performance across diverse control tasks. In the context of heating systems in the buildings, optimizing the energy efficiency while maintaining the residents' thermal comfort can be intuitively formulated as a constrained optimization problem. However, to solve it with RL may require large amount of data. Therefore, an accurate and versatile simulator is favored. In this paper, we propose a novel building simulator I4B which provides interfaces for different usages and apply a model-free constrained RL algorithm named constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Linear Smoothed Log Barrier function (CSAC-LB) to the heating optimization problem. Benchmarking against baseline algorithms demonstrates CSAC-LB's efficiency in data exploration, constraint satisfaction and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehao Huang, Xinwen Cheng, JingHao Zheng, Haoran Wang, Zhengbao He, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged to enhance the privacy and trustworthiness of deep neural networks. Approximate MU is a practical method for large-scale models. Our investigation into approximate MU starts with identifying the steepest descent direction, minimizing the output Kullback-Leibler divergence to exact MU inside a parameters' neighborhood. This probed direction decomposes into three components: weighted forgetting gradient ascent, fine-tuning retaining gradient descent, and a weight saliency matrix. Such decomposition derived from Euclidean metric encompasses most existing gradient-based MU methods. Nevertheless, adhering to Euclidean space may result in sub-optimal iterative trajectories due to the overlooked geometric structure of the output probability space. We suggest embedding the unlearning update into a manifold rendered by the remaining geometry, incorporating second-order Hessian from the remaining data. It helps prevent effective unlearning from interfering with the retained performance. However, computing the second-order Hessian for large-scale models is intractable. To efficiently leverage the benefits of Hessian modulation, we propose a fast-slow parameter update strategy to implicitly approximate the up-to-date salient unlearning direction. Free from specific modal constraints, our approach is adaptable across computer vision unlearning tasks, including classification and generation. Extensive experiments validate our efficacy and efficiency. Notably, our method successfully performs class-forgetting on ImageNet using DiT and forgets a class on CIFAR-10 using DDPM in just 50 steps, compared to thousands of steps required by previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Tan, Yining Qian, Ang Lv, Hongzhan Lin, Songhao Wu, Yongbo Wang, Feng Wang, Jingtong Wu, Xin Lu, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have introduced a new paradigm for web search. However, the limited context awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing methods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or memory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position embeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention Re-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero inference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying, we first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby diminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight their outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is optimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task. As a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby reducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the optimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the specific task at hand. Our proposed PEAR offers two major advantages over previous approaches: (1) It introduces zero additional inference overhead in terms of memory usage or inference time, while outperforming competitive baselines in accuracy and efficiency across various RAG tasks. (2) It is independent of position embedding algorithms, ensuring broader applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Abdelhamid, Abhyuday Desai</p>
<p>Abstract: Class imbalance in binary classification tasks remains a significant challenge in machine learning, often resulting in poor performance on minority classes. This study comprehensively evaluates three widely-used strategies for handling class imbalance: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Class Weights tuning, and Decision Threshold Calibration. We compare these methods against a baseline scenario of no-intervention across 15 diverse machine learning models and 30 datasets from various domains, conducting a total of 9,000 experiments. Performance was primarily assessed using the F1-score, although our study also tracked results on additional 9 metrics including F2-score, precision, recall, Brier-score, PR-AUC, and AUC. Our results indicate that all three strategies generally outperform the baseline, with Decision Threshold Calibration emerging as the most consistently effective technique. However, we observed substantial variability in the best-performing method across datasets, highlighting the importance of testing multiple approaches for specific problems. This study provides valuable insights for practitioners dealing with imbalanced datasets and emphasizes the need for dataset-specific analysis in evaluating class imbalance handling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Son Quoc Tran, Matt Kretchmar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel training method to improve the robustness of Extractive Question Answering (EQA) models. Previous research has shown that existing models, when trained on EQA datasets that include unanswerable questions, demonstrate a significant lack of robustness against distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. Despite this, the inclusion of unanswerable questions in EQA training datasets is essential for ensuring real-world reliability. Our proposed training method includes a novel loss function for the EQA problem and challenges an implicit assumption present in numerous EQA datasets. Models trained with our method maintain in-domain performance while achieving a notable improvement on out-of-domain datasets. This results in an overall F1 score improvement of 5.7 across all testing sets. Furthermore, our models exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against two types of adversarial attacks, with a performance decrease of only about a third compared to the default models.</p>

Specifically, the proposed method is capable of jointly learning both the control policy and the communication policy, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computational overhead when learning them separately or only one of them. By augmenting the state space with accrued rewards that represent the performance over the entire trajectory, we show that accurate and efficient determination of triggering conditions is possible without the need for explicit learning triggering conditions, thereby leading to an adaptive non-stationary policy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Naik, Marcus Alenius, Daniel Fried, Carolyn Rose</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of automated code review has recently gained a lot of attention from the machine learning community. However, current review comment evaluation metrics rely on comparisons with a human-written reference for a given code change (also called a diff), even though code review is a one-to-many problem like generation and summarization with many "valid reviews" for a diff. To tackle these issues we develop a CRScore - a reference-free metric to measure dimensions of review quality like conciseness, comprehensiveness, and relevance. We design CRScore to evaluate reviews in a way that is grounded in claims and potential issues detected in the code by LLMs and static analyzers. We demonstrate that CRScore can produce valid, fine-grained scores of review quality that have the greatest alignment with human judgment (0.54 Spearman correlation) and are more sensitive than reference-based metrics. We also release a corpus of 2.6k human-annotated review quality scores for machine-generated and GitHub review comments to support the development of automated metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in zero-shot audio recognition tasks, which match features of audio waveforms with class-specific text prompt features, inspired by advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given the sensitivity of zero-shot performance to the choice of hand-crafted text prompts, many prompt learning techniques have been developed for VLMs. We explore the efficacy of these approaches in ALMs and propose a novel method, Prompt Learning in Audio Language Models (PALM), which optimizes the feature space of the text encoder branch. Unlike existing methods that work in the input space, our approach results in greater training efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 11 audio recognition datasets, encompassing a variety of speech-processing tasks, and compare the results with three baselines in a few-shot learning setup. Our method is either on par with or outperforms other approaches while being computationally less demanding. Code is available at https://asif-hanif.github.io/palm/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhao, Simran Kaur, Dingli Yu, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly advanced, their ability to exhibit compositional generalization -- the capacity to combine learned skills in novel ways not encountered during training -- has garnered significant attention. This type of generalization, particularly in scenarios beyond training data, is also of great interest in the study of AI safety and alignment. A recent study introduced the SKILL-MIX evaluation, where models are tasked with composing a short paragraph demonstrating the use of a specified $k$-tuple of language skills. While small models struggled with composing even with $k=3$, larger models like GPT-4 performed reasonably well with $k=5$ and $6$.
  In this paper, we employ a setup akin to SKILL-MIX to evaluate the capacity of smaller models to learn compositional generalization from examples. Utilizing a diverse set of language skills -- including rhetorical, literary, reasoning, theory of mind, and common sense -- GPT-4 was used to generate text samples that exhibit random subsets of $k$ skills. Subsequent fine-tuning of 7B and 13B parameter models on these combined skill texts, for increasing values of $k$, revealed the following findings: (1) Training on combinations of $k=2$ and $3$ skills results in noticeable improvements in the ability to compose texts with $k=4$ and $5$ skills, despite models never having seen such examples during training. (2) When skill categories are split into training and held-out groups, models significantly improve at composing texts with held-out skills during testing despite having only seen training skills during fine-tuning, illustrating the efficacy of the training approach even with previously unseen skills. This study also suggests that incorporating skill-rich (potentially synthetic) text into training can substantially enhance the compositional capabilities of models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linji Wang, Zifan Xu, Peter Stone, Xuesu Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The high cost of real-world data for robotics Reinforcement Learning (RL) leads to the wide usage of simulators. Despite extensive work on building better dynamics models for simulators to match with the real world, there is another, often-overlooked mismatch between simulations and the real world, namely the distribution of available training tasks. Such a mismatch is further exacerbated by existing curriculum learning techniques, which automatically vary the simulation task distribution without considering its relevance to the real world. Considering these challenges, we posit that curriculum learning for robotics RL needs to be grounded in real-world task distributions. To this end, we propose Grounded Curriculum Learning (GCL), which aligns the simulated task distribution in the curriculum with the real world, as well as explicitly considers what tasks have been given to the robot and how the robot has performed in the past. We validate GCL using the BARN dataset on complex navigation tasks, achieving a 6.8% and 6.5% higher success rate compared to a state-of-the-art CL method and a curriculum designed by human experts, respectively. These results show that GCL can enhance learning efficiency and navigation performance by grounding the simulation task distribution in the real world within an adaptive curriculum.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johnathan Xie, Annie S. Chen, Yoonho Lee, Eric Mitchell, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is not only measured by their ability to generate accurate outputs but also by their calibration-how well their confidence scores reflect the probability of their outputs being correct. While unsupervised pre-training has been shown to yield LLMs with well-calibrated conditional probabilities, recent studies have shown that after fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the calibration of these models degrades significantly. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Temperature Scaling (ATS), a post-hoc calibration method that predicts a temperature scaling parameter for each token prediction. The predicted temperature values adapt based on token-level features and are fit over a standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. The adaptive nature of ATS addresses the varying degrees of calibration shift that can occur after RLHF fine-tuning. ATS improves calibration by over 10-50% across three downstream natural language evaluation benchmarks compared to prior calibration methods and does not impede performance improvements from RLHF.</p>

The problem forms an essential building block for multi-robot systems in applications such as exploration, surveillance, and transportation. We address this problem in a decentralized setting where each robot knows only the positions of its $k$-nearest robots and $k$-nearest targets. This scenario combines elements of combinatorial assignment and continuous-space motion planning, posing significant scalability challenges for traditional centralized approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a decentralized policy learned via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN enables robots to determine (1) what information to communicate to neighbors and (2) how to integrate received information with local observations for decision-making. We train the GNN using imitation learning with the centralized Hungarian algorithm as the expert policy, and further fine-tune it using reinforcement learning to avoid collisions and enhance performance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The GNN policy trained on 100 robots generalizes to scenarios with up to 500 robots, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 8.6\% on average and significantly surpassing greedy decentralized methods. This work lays the foundation for solving multi-robot coordination problems in settings where scalability is important.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ezra Karger, Houtan Bastani, Chen Yueh-Han, Zachary Jacobs, Danny Halawi, Fred Zhang, Philip E. Tetlock</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the ability of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark (N = 200). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-values <= 0.01). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Hsiang Kao, Bharath Hariharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has faced criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues such as the backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These limitations have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible learning algorithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural systems adapt and learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms observed in biological systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a biologically plausible framework for credit assignment in neural networks. This framework employs a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback network to process targets, with each network enhancing the other through anti-parallel signal propagation. By leveraging the more informative signals from the bottom layer of the feedback network to guide the updates of the top layer of the feedforward network and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous transformation of source inputs to target outputs and the dynamic mutual influence of these transformations. Experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets using multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that CCL achieves comparable performance to other biologically plausible algorithms while offering a more biologically realistic learning mechanism. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of our approach to an autoencoder task, underscoring its potential for unsupervised representation learning. Our work presents a direction for biologically inspired and plausible learning algorithms, offering an alternative mechanisms of learning and adaptation in neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Gao, Ziqi Xu, Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Jixue Liu, Thuc Duy Le, Debo Cheng, Yanchang Zhao, Yun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the growing demand for long sequence time-series forecasting in real-world applications, such as electricity consumption planning, the significance of time series forecasting becomes increasingly crucial across various domains. This is highlighted by recent advancements in representation learning within the field. This study introduces a novel multi-view approach for time series forecasting that innovatively integrates trend and seasonal representations with an Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-based representation. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods in representing complex and high-dimensional time series data, this research addresses the challenge by combining TS (trend and seasonality) and ICA (independent components) perspectives. This approach offers a holistic understanding of time series data, going beyond traditional models that often miss nuanced, nonlinear relationships. The efficacy of TSI model is demonstrated through comprehensive testing on various benchmark datasets, where it shows superior performance over current state-of-the-art models, particularly in multivariate forecasting. This method not only enhances the accuracy of forecasting but also contributes significantly to the field by providing a more in-depth understanding of time series data. The research which uses ICA for a view lays the groundwork for further exploration and methodological advancements in time series forecasting, opening new avenues for research and practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huangyu Dai, Ben Chen, Kaidi Chen, Ying Han, Zihan Liang, Wen Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: For crosslingual conversation and trade, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is pivotal yet faces persistent challenges with monotony and repetition in generated content. Traditional solutions that rely on penalizing text redundancy or token reoccurrence have shown limited efficacy, particularly for lengthy article and e-commerce descriptions with inherent redundancy, even with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the underlying causes of textual repetition through the lens of information entropy, attributing the phenomenon to the elevated uncertainty within the input text. To address this, a novel algorithm named Contrastive Token Learning with Similarity Decay (CTSD) is introduced, which modulates the suppression of tokens dynamically, informed by varying attention weights and inter-token distances. Furthermore, an e-commerce dataset comprised of title texts of online real items is compiled and released susceptible to hallucination translations to benchmark the algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CTSD significantly outperforms existing approaches in precision and generalizability. Additional online A/B testing underscores its practical value, showing marked improvements in user engagement and conversion. Notably, this method has been implemented with full traffic on eight multilingual sites of alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Zhang, Andrew Thwaites, Alexandra Woolgar, Brian Moore, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Chen, Weisen Jiang, Baijiong Lin, James T. Kwok, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works show that assembling multiple off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) can harness their complementary abilities. To achieve this, routing is a promising method, which learns a router to select the most suitable LLM for each query. However, existing routing models are ineffective when multiple LLMs perform well for a query. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a method called query-based Router by Dual Contrastive learning (RouterDC). The RouterDC model consists of an encoder and LLM embeddings, and we propose two contrastive learning losses to train the RouterDC model. Experimental results show that RouterDC is effective in assembling LLMs and largely outperforms individual top-performing LLMs as well as existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+2.76\%) and out-of-distribution (+1.90\%) tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Yuan, Weitong Chen, Hanlin Wang, Kai Yu, Xin Peng, Yiling Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages.
  In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p>

To address these shortcomings, we create UniSumEval benchmark, which extends the range of input context (e.g., domain, length) and provides fine-grained, multi-dimensional annotations. We use AI assistance in data creation, identifying potentially hallucinogenic input texts, and also helping human annotators reduce the difficulty of fine-grained annotation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Bjorck, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Furu Wei, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art LLMs are powered by scaling -- scaling model size, dataset size and cluster size. It is economically infeasible to extensively tune hyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal hyperparameters must be inferred or \textit{transferred} from smaller experiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in Yang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token horizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale empirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in LLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly with token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we demonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR for longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via our scaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token horizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence that LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We thus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and overlooked component of LLM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samia Belhadj, Sanguk Park, Ambika Seth, Hesham Dar, Thijs Kooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in medical AI is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of healthcare delivery. While most of the prior work done on fairness emphasizes the importance of equal performance, we argue that decreases in fairness can be either harmful or non-harmful, depending on the type of change and how sensitive attributes are used. To this end, we introduce the notion of positive-sum fairness, which states that an increase in performance that results in a larger group disparity is acceptable as long as it does not come at the cost of individual subgroup performance. This allows sensitive attributes correlated with the disease to be used to increase performance without compromising on fairness.
  We illustrate this idea by comparing four CNN models that make different use of the race attribute in the training phase. The results show that removing all demographic encodings from the images helps close the gap in performance between the different subgroups, whereas leveraging the race attribute as a model's input increases the overall performance while widening the disparities between subgroups. These larger gaps are then put in perspective of the collective benefit through our notion of positive-sum fairness to distinguish harmful from non harmful disparities.</p>

It is essential for automation processing to correctly recognize scanned voucher text, such as the company name on invoices. However, perfect recognition is complex due to the noise, such as stamps. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly rectify erroneous OCR results. However, no publicly available OCR error correction benchmarks for Japanese exist, and methods have not been adequately researched. In this study, we measured text recognition accuracy by existing services on Japanese vouchers and developed a post-OCR correction benchmark. Then, we proposed simple baselines for error correction using language models and verified whether the proposed method could effectively correct these errors. In the experiments, the proposed error correction algorithm significantly improved overall recognition accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyou Fan, Chenjia Bai, Zhao Shan, Haoran He, Yang Zhang, Zhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their capabilities in modeling trajectories of multi-tasks. However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner that can leverage large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SODP}, a two-stage framework that leverages \textbf{S}ub-\textbf{O}ptimal data to learn a \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}lanner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to fast refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiben Liu, Huijie Fan, Qiang Wang, Weihong Ren, Yandong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to continuously learn from non-stationary data to match individuals in different environments. Each task is affected by variations in illumination and person-related information (such as pose and clothing), leading to task-wise domain gaps. Current LReID methods focus on task-specific knowledge and ignore intrinsic task-shared representations within domain gaps, limiting model performance. Bridging task-wise domain gaps is crucial for improving anti-forgetting and generalization capabilities, especially when accessing limited old classes during training. To address these issues, we propose a novel attribute-text guided forgetting compensation (ATFC) model, which explores text-driven global representations of identity-related information and attribute-related local representations of identity-free information for LReID. Due to the lack of paired text-image data, we design an attribute-text generator (ATG) to dynamically generate a text descriptor for each instance. We then introduce a text-guided aggregation network (TGA) to explore robust text-driven global representations for each identity and knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we propose an attribute compensation network (ACN) to investigate attribute-related local representations, which distinguish similar identities and bridge domain gaps. Finally, we develop an attribute anti-forgetting (AF) loss and knowledge transfer (KT) loss to minimize domain gaps and achieve knowledge transfer, improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ATFC method achieves superior performance, outperforming existing LReID methods by over 9.0$\%$/7.4$\%$ in average mAP/R-1 on the seen dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyi Xiao, Xiangnan He, Yixin Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: A key to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to choose a proper representation space, e.g., point-wise Euclidean space and complex vector space. In this paper, we propose a unified perspective of embedding and introduce uncertainty into KGE from the view of group theory. Our model can incorporate existing models (i.e., generality), ensure the computation is tractable (i.e., efficiency) and enjoy the expressive power of complex random variables (i.e., expressiveness). The core idea is that we embed entities/relations as elements of a symmetric group, i.e., permutations of a set. Permutations of different sets can reflect different properties of embedding. And the group operation of symmetric groups is easy to compute. In specific, we show that the embedding of many existing models, point vectors, can be seen as elements of a symmetric group. To reflect uncertainty, we first embed entities/relations as permutations of a set of random variables. A permutation can transform a simple random variable into a complex random variable for greater expressiveness, called a normalizing flow. We then define scoring functions by measuring the similarity of two normalizing flows, namely NFE. We construct several instantiating models and prove that they are able to learn logical rules. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing uncertainty and our model. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/NFE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eitan Wagner, Yuli Slavutsky, Omri Abend</p>
<p>Abstract: Although language model scores are often treated as probabilities, their reliability as probability estimators has mainly been studied through calibration, overlooking other aspects. In particular, it is unclear whether language models produce the same value for different ways of assigning joint probabilities to word spans. Our work introduces a novel framework, ConTestS (Consistency Testing over Spans), involving statistical tests to assess score consistency across interchangeable completion and conditioning orders. We conduct experiments on post-release real and synthetic data to eliminate training effects. Our findings reveal that both Masked Language Models (MLMs) and autoregressive models exhibit inconsistent predictions, with autoregressive models showing larger discrepancies. Larger MLMs tend to produce more consistent predictions, while autoregressive models show the opposite trend. Moreover, for both model types, prediction entropies offer insights into the true word span likelihood and therefore can aid in selecting optimal decoding strategies. The inconsistencies revealed by our analysis, as well their connection to prediction entropies and differences between model types, can serve as useful guides for future research on addressing these limitations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Even though a few initial works have shown on small sets of data some level of bias in the performance of fingerprint recognition technology with respect to certain demographic groups, there is still not sufficient evidence to understand the impact that certain factors such as gender, age or finger-type may have on fingerprint quality and, in turn, also on fingerprint matching accuracy. The present work addresses this still under researched topic, on a large-scale database of operational data containing 10-print impressions of almost 16,000 subjects. The results reached provide further insight into the dependency of fingerprint quality and demographics, and show that there in fact exists a certain degree of performance variability in fingerprint-based recognition systems for different segments of the population. Based on the experimental evaluation, the work points out new observations based on data-driven evidence, provides plausible hypotheses to explain such observations, and concludes with potential follow-up actions that can help to reduce the observed fingerprint quality differences. This way, the current paper can be considered as a contribution to further increase the algorithmic fairness and equality of biometric technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains, including Web search, healthcare, and software development. However, as these models scale, they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, particularly backdoor attacks. By exploiting the potent memorization capacity of LLMs, adversaries can easily inject backdoors into LLMs by manipulating a small portion of training data, leading to malicious behaviors in downstream applications whenever the hidden backdoor is activated by the pre-defined triggers. Moreover, emerging learning paradigms like instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) exacerbate these risks as they rely heavily on crowdsourced data and human feedback, which are not fully controlled. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of emerging backdoor threats to LLMs that appear during LLM development or inference, and cover recent advancement in both defense and detection strategies for mitigating backdoor threats to LLMs. We also outline key challenges in addressing these threats, highlighting areas for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Li, Wei Zhao, Yige Li, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence functions aim to quantify the impact of individual training data points on a model's predictions. While extensive research has been conducted on influence functions in traditional machine learning models, their application to large language models (LLMs) has been limited. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to address a key question: do influence functions work on LLMs? Specifically, we evaluate influence functions across multiple tasks and find that they consistently perform poorly in most settings. Our further investigation reveals that their poor performance can be attributed to: (1) inevitable approximation errors when estimating the iHVP component due to the scale of LLMs, (2) uncertain convergence during fine-tuning, and, more fundamentally, (3) the definition itself, as changes in model parameters do not necessarily correlate with changes in LLM behavior. Our study thus suggests the need for alternative approaches for identifying influential samples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiseok Lee, Brian Kenji Iwana</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning is a common practice that alleviates the need for extensive data to train neural networks. It is performed by pre-training a model using a source dataset and fine-tuning it for a target task. However, not every source dataset is appropriate for each target dataset, especially for time series. In this paper, we propose a novel method of selecting and using multiple datasets for transfer learning for time series classification. Specifically, our method combines multiple datasets as one source dataset for pre-training neural networks. Furthermore, for selecting multiple sources, our method measures the transferability of datasets based on shapelet discovery for effective source selection. While traditional transferability measures require considerable time for pre-training all the possible sources for source selection of each possible architecture, our method can be repeatedly used for every possible architecture with a single simple computation. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate that it is possible to increase the performance of temporal convolutional neural networks (CNN) on time series datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhang, Wenbin Wang, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has recently witnessed an emerging direction seeking to tackle the issue of data incompleteness. Recognizing that the language modality typically contains dense sentiment information, we consider it as the dominant modality and present an innovative Language-dominated Noise-resistant Learning Network (LNLN) to achieve robust MSA. The proposed LNLN features a dominant modality correction (DMC) module and dominant modality based multimodal learning (DMML) module, which enhances the model's robustness across various noise scenarios by ensuring the quality of dominant modality representations. Aside from the methodical design, we perform comprehensive experiments under random data missing scenarios, utilizing diverse and meaningful settings on several popular datasets (\textit{e.g.,} MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS), providing additional uniformity, transparency, and fairness compared to existing evaluations in the literature. Empirically, LNLN consistently outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating superior performance across these challenging and extensive evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menna Fateen, Bo Wang, Tsunenori Mine</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic short answer scoring (ASAS) helps reduce the grading burden on educators but often lacks detailed, explainable feedback. Existing methods in ASAS with feedback (ASAS-F) rely on fine-tuning language models with limited datasets, which is resource-intensive and struggles to generalize across contexts. Recent approaches using large language models (LLMs) have focused on scoring without extensive fine-tuning. However, they often rely heavily on prompt engineering and either fail to generate elaborated feedback or do not adequately evaluate it. In this paper, we propose a modular retrieval augmented generation based ASAS-F system that scores answers and generates feedback in strict zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. We design our system to be adaptable to various educational tasks without extensive prompt engineering using an automatic prompt generation framework. Results show an improvement in scoring accuracy by 9\% on unseen questions compared to fine-tuning, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guixian Zhang, Guan Yuan, Debo Cheng, Lin Liu, Jiuyong Li, Shichao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) creates new opportunities for recommender systems, especially by exploiting the side information (e.g., descriptions and analyses of items) generated by these models. However, aligning this side information with collaborative information from historical interactions poses significant challenges. The inherent biases within LLMs can skew recommendations, resulting in distorted and potentially unfair user experiences. On the other hand, propensity bias causes side information to be aligned in such a way that it often tends to represent all inputs in a low-dimensional subspace, leading to a phenomenon known as dimensional collapse, which severely restricts the recommender system's ability to capture user preferences and behaviours. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework named Counterfactual LLM Recommendation (CLLMR). Specifically, we propose a spectrum-based side information encoder that implicitly embeds structural information from historical interactions into the side information representation, thereby circumventing the risk of dimension collapse. Furthermore, our CLLMR approach explores the causal relationships inherent in LLM-based recommender systems. By leveraging counterfactual inference, we counteract the biases introduced by LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CLLMR approach consistently enhances the performance of various recommender models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate zero-shot cross-lingual news sentiment detection, aiming to develop robust sentiment classifiers that can be deployed across multiple languages without target-language training data. We introduce novel evaluation datasets in several less-resourced languages, and experiment with a range of approaches including the use of machine translation; in-context learning with large language models; and various intermediate training regimes including a novel task objective, POA, that leverages paragraph-level information. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over the state of the art, with in-context learning generally giving the best performance, but with the novel POA approach giving a competitive alternative with much lower computational overhead. We also show that language similarity is not in itself sufficient for predicting the success of cross-lingual transfer, but that similarity in semantic content and structure can be equally important.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge discovery is key to understand and interpret a dataset, as well as to find the underlying relationships between its components. Unsupervised Cognition is a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that focus on modelling the learned data. This paper presents three techniques to perform knowledge discovery over an already trained Unsupervised Cognition model. Specifically, we present a technique for pattern mining, a technique for feature selection based on the previous pattern mining technique, and a technique for dimensionality reduction based on the previous feature selection technique. The final goal is to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant features and use them to build a model from which to extract meaningful patterns. We evaluated our proposals with empirical experiments and found that they overcome the state-of-the-art in knowledge discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byunghyun Kim, Jae-Gil Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series forecasting, characterized by non-uniform intervals, is prevalent in practical applications. However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zining Zhang, Yao Chen, Bingsheng He, Zhenjie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) pose challenges for their deployment on personal computers and mobile devices. Aggressive post-training model compression is necessary to reduce the models' size, but it often results in significant accuracy loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel network pruning technology that utilizes over 0.7 sparsity and less than 8 bits of quantization. Our approach enables the compression of prevailing LLMs within a couple of hours while maintaining a relatively small accuracy loss. In experimental evaluations, our method demonstrates effectiveness and potential for practical deployment. By making LLMs available on domestic devices, our work can facilitate a new era of natural language processing applications with wide-ranging impacts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) in the medical domain can underperform in real-world applications involving small datasets in a non-English language with few labeled samples and imbalanced classes. There is yet no consensus on how to approach this problem. We evaluated a set of NLP models including BERT-like transformers, few-shot learning with sentence transformers (SetFit), and prompted large language models (LLM), using three datasets of radiology reports on magnetic resonance images of epilepsy patients in Danish, a low-resource language. Our results indicate that BERT-like models pretrained in the target domain of radiology reports currently offer the optimal performances for this scenario. Notably, the SetFit and LLM models underperformed compared to BERT-like models, with LLM performing the worst. Importantly, none of the models investigated was sufficiently accurate to allow for text classification without any supervision. However, they show potential for data filtering, which could reduce the amount of manual labeling required.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the 1 Trillion Token Platform (1TT Platform), a novel framework designed to facilitate efficient data sharing with a transparent and equitable profit-sharing mechanism. The platform fosters collaboration between data contributors, who provide otherwise non-disclosed datasets, and a data consumer, who utilizes these datasets to enhance their own services. Data contributors are compensated in monetary terms, receiving a share of the revenue generated by the services of the data consumer. The data consumer is committed to sharing a portion of the revenue with contributors, according to predefined profit-sharing arrangements. By incorporating a transparent profit-sharing paradigm to incentivize large-scale data sharing, the 1TT Platform creates a collaborative environment to drive the advancement of NLP and LLM technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph D. Ramsey, Bryan Andrews, Peter Spirtes</p>
<p>Abstract: We give a novel nonparametric pointwise consistent statistical test (the Markov Checker) of the Markov condition for directed acyclic graph (DAG) or completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) models given a dataset. We also introduce the Cross-Algorithm Frugality Search (CAFS) for rejecting DAG models that either do not pass the Markov Checker test or that are not edge minimal. Edge minimality has been used previously by Raskutti and Uhler as a nonparametric simplicity criterion, though CAFS readily generalizes to other simplicity conditions. Reference to the ground truth is not necessary for CAFS, so it is useful for finding causal structure learning algorithms and tuning parameter settings that output causal models that are approximately true from a given data set. We provide a software tool for this analysis that is suitable for even quite large or dense models, provided a suitably fast pointwise consistent test of conditional independence is available. In addition, we show in simulation that the CAFS procedure can pick approximately correct models without knowing the ground truth.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the shift towards human-centered manufacturing, our two-year longitudinal study investigates the real-world impact of deploying Cognitive Assistants (CAs) in factories. The CAs were designed to facilitate knowledge sharing among factory operators. Our investigation focused on smartphone-based voice assistants and LLM-powered chatbots, examining their usability and utility in a real-world factory setting. Based on the qualitative feedback we collected during the deployments of CAs at the factories, we conducted a thematic analysis to investigate the perceptions, challenges, and overall impact on workflow and knowledge sharing.
  Our results indicate that while CAs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency through knowledge sharing and quicker resolution of production issues, they also introduce concerns around workplace surveillance, the types of knowledge that can be shared, and shortcomings compared to human-to-human knowledge sharing. Additionally, our findings stress the importance of addressing privacy, knowledge contribution burdens, and tensions between factory operators and their managers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting future disease progression risk from medical images is challenging due to patient heterogeneity, and subtle or unknown imaging biomarkers. Moreover, deep learning (DL) methods for survival analysis are susceptible to image domain shifts across scanners. We tackle these issues in the task of predicting late dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (dAMD) onset from retinal OCT scans. We propose a novel DL method for survival prediction to jointly predict from the current scan a risk score, inversely related to time-to-conversion, and the probability of conversion within a time interval $t$. It uses a family of parallel hyperplanes generated by parameterizing the bias term as a function of $t$. In addition, we develop unsupervised losses based on intra-subject image pairs to ensure that risk scores increase over time and that future conversion predictions are consistent with AMD stage prediction using actual scans of future visits. Such losses enable data-efficient fine-tuning of the trained model on new unlabeled datasets acquired with a different scanner. Extensive evaluation on two large datasets acquired with different scanners resulted in a mean AUROCs of 0.82 for Dataset-1 and 0.83 for Dataset-2, across prediction intervals of 6,12 and 24 months.</p>

Specifically, we first align the melody with audio waveforms and their associated descriptions using the multimodal alignment module. Subsequently, we condition the diffusion module on the learned melody representations. This allows MMGen to generate music that matches the style of the provided audio while also producing music that reflects the content of the given text description. To address the scarcity of high-quality data, we construct a multi-modal dataset, MusicSet, which includes melody, text, and audio, and will be made publicly available. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model both in terms of experimental metrics and actual performance quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a dynamic benchmarking system for conversational agents that evaluates their performance through a single, simulated, and lengthy user$\leftrightarrow$agent interaction. The interaction is a conversation between the user and agent, where multiple tasks are introduced and then undertaken concurrently. We context switch regularly to interleave the tasks, which constructs a realistic testing scenario in which we assess the Long-Term Memory, Continual Learning, and Information Integration capabilities of the agents. Results from both proprietary and open-source Large-Language Models show that LLMs in general perform well on single-task interactions, but they struggle on the same tasks when they are interleaved. Notably, short-context LLMs supplemented with an LTM system perform as well as or better than those with larger contexts. Our benchmark suggests that there are other challenges for LLMs responding to more natural interactions that contemporary benchmarks have heretofore not been able to capture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: As mobile devices increasingly become focal points for advanced applications, edge computing presents a viable solution to their inherent computational limitations, particularly in deploying large language models (LLMs). However, despite the advancements in edge computing, significant challenges remain in efficient training and deploying LLMs due to the computational demands and data privacy concerns associated with these models. This paper explores a collaborative training framework that integrates mobile users with edge servers to optimize resource allocation, thereby enhancing both performance and efficiency. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, allowing mobile users to adjust the initial layers of the LLM while edge servers handle the more demanding latter layers. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption and delay during training. We also address the common issue of instability in model performance by incorporating stability enhancements into our objective function. Through novel fractional programming technique, we achieve a stationary point for the formulated problem. Simulations demonstrate that our method reduces the energy consumption as well as the latency, and increases the reliability of LLMs across various mobile settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for rigorous scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different forms of virtual reality (VR) treatments as either immersive virtual reality (IVR) or non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) in comparison to conventional therapy (CT) in improving physical and psychological status among stroke patients. METHODS: The literature search was conducted on seven databases. ACM Digital Library, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus. The effect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated using Cohen's d. Pooled results were used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. 3 trials demonstrated that immersive virtual reality improved upper limb activity, function and activity of daily life in a way comparable to CT. 18 trials showed that NIVR had similar benefits to CT for upper limb activity and function, balance and mobility, activities of daily living and participation. A comparison between the different forms of VR showed that IVR may be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb training and activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: This study found out that IVR therapies may be more effective than NIVR but not CT to improve upper limb activity, function, and daily life activities. However, there is no evidence of the durability of IVR treatment. More research involving studies with larger samples is needed to assess the long-term effects and promising benefits of immersive virtual reality technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: In an era where large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into a wide range of everyday applications, research into these models' behavior has surged. However, due to the novelty of the field, clear methodological guidelines are lacking. This raises concerns about the replicability and generalizability of insights gained from research on LLM behavior. In this study, we discuss the potential risk of a replication crisis and support our concerns with a series of replication experiments focused on prompt engineering techniques purported to influence reasoning abilities in LLMs. We tested GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Llama 3-8B, and Llama 3-70B, on the chain-of-thought, EmotionPrompting, ExpertPrompting, Sandbagging, as well as Re-Reading prompt engineering techniques, using manually double-checked subsets of reasoning benchmarks including CommonsenseQA, CRT, NumGLUE, ScienceQA, and StrategyQA. Our findings reveal a general lack of statistically significant differences across nearly all techniques tested, highlighting, among others, several methodological weaknesses in previous research. We propose a forward-looking approach that includes developing robust methodologies for evaluating LLMs, establishing sound benchmarks, and designing rigorous experimental frameworks to ensure accurate and reliable assessments of model outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osama Mustafa</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of deep learning in cancer research, particularly in early diagnosis, case understanding, and treatment strategy design, emphasizes the need for high-quality data. Generative AI, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has emerged as a leading solution to challenges like class imbalance, robust learning, and model training, while addressing issues stemming from patient privacy and the scarcity of real data. Despite their promise, GANs face several challenges, both inherent and specific to histopathology data. Inherent issues include training imbalance, mode collapse, linear learning from insufficient discriminator feedback, and hard boundary convergence due to stringent feedback. Histopathology data presents a unique challenge with its complex representation, high spatial resolution, and multiscale features. To address these challenges, we propose a framework consisting of two components. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based Multistage Progressive Finetuning Siamese Neural Network (MFT-SNN) for assessing the similarity between histopathology patches. Second, we implement a Reinforcement Learning-based External Optimizer (RL-EO) within the GAN training loop, serving as a reward signal generator. The modified discriminator loss function incorporates a weighted reward, guiding the GAN to maximize this reward while minimizing loss. This approach offers an external optimization guide to the discriminator, preventing generator overfitting and ensuring smooth convergence. Our proposed solution has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) GANs and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic model, outperforming previous SOTA across various metrics, including FID score, KID score, Perceptual Path Length, and downstream classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Yi, Zengke Liu, Jianwei Zhang, Chengyuan Li, Tong Zhang, Junyang Lin, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated promising capabilities upon scaling up parameters. However, serving large language models incurs substantial computation and memory movement costs due to their large scale. Quantization methods have been employed to reduce service costs and latency. Nevertheless, outliers in activations hinder the development of INT4 weight-activation quantization. Existing approaches separate outliers and normal values into two matrices or migrate outliers from activations to weights, suffering from high latency or accuracy degradation. Based on observing activations from large language models, outliers can be classified into channel-wise and spike outliers. In this work, we propose Rotated Runtime Smooth (RRS), a plug-and-play activation smoother for quantization, consisting of Runtime Smooth and the Rotation operation. Runtime Smooth (RS) is introduced to eliminate channel-wise outliers by smoothing activations with channel-wise maximums during runtime. The rotation operation can narrow the gap between spike outliers and normal values, alleviating the effect of victims caused by channel-wise smoothing. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the LLaMA and Qwen families and improves WikiText-2 perplexity from 57.33 to 6.66 for INT4 inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives.
  Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiwei Ye, Songgaojun Deng, Qiaosha Zou, Ning Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting typically needs to address non-stationary data with evolving trend and seasonal patterns. To address the non-stationarity, reversible instance normalization has been recently proposed to alleviate impacts from the trend with certain statistical measures, e.g., mean and variance. Although they demonstrate improved predictive accuracy, they are limited to expressing basic trends and are incapable of handling seasonal patterns. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new instance normalization solution, called frequency adaptive normalization (FAN), which extends instance normalization in handling both dynamic trend and seasonal patterns. Specifically, we employ the Fourier transform to identify instance-wise predominant frequent components that cover most non-stationary factors. Furthermore, the discrepancy of those frequency components between inputs and outputs is explicitly modeled as a prediction task with a simple MLP model. FAN is a model-agnostic method that can be applied to arbitrary predictive backbones. We instantiate FAN on four widely used forecasting models as the backbone and evaluate their prediction performance improvements on eight benchmark datasets. FAN demonstrates significant performance advancement, achieving 7.76% ~ 37.90% average improvements in MSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jarne Verhaeghe, Jef Jonkers, Sofie Van Hoecke</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the dose-response relation between a continuous treatment and the outcome for an individual can greatly drive decision-making, particularly in areas like personalized drug dosing and personalized healthcare interventions. Point estimates are often insufficient in these high-risk environments, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification to support informed decisions. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free and model-agnostic method for uncertainty quantification, has seen limited application in continuous treatments or dose-response models. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology that frames the causal dose-response problem as a covariate shift, leveraging weighted conformal prediction. By incorporating propensity estimation, conformal predictive systems, and likelihood ratios, we present a practical solution for generating prediction intervals for dose-response models. Additionally, our method approximates local coverage for every treatment value by applying kernel functions as weights in weighted conformal prediction. Finally, we use a new synthetic benchmark dataset to demonstrate the significance of covariate shift assumptions in achieving robust prediction intervals for dose-response models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganchao Wei, Li Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocates the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocities of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacong Wang, Bohong Wu, Haiyong Jiang, Xun Zhou, Xin Xiao, Haoyuan Guo, Jun Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the scarcity of high-quality multi-modal alignment data have inspired numerous researches on synthetic VLM data generation. The conventional norm in VLM data construction uses a mixture of specialists in caption and OCR, or stronger VLM APIs and expensive human annotation. In this paper, we present World to Code (W2C), a meticulously curated multi-modal data construction pipeline that organizes the final generation output into a Python code format. The pipeline leverages the VLM itself to extract cross-modal information via different prompts and filter the generated outputs again via a consistency filtering strategy. Experiments have demonstrated the high quality of W2C by improving various existing visual question answering and visual grounding benchmarks across different VLMs. Further analysis also demonstrates that the new code parsing ability of VLMs presents better cross-modal equivalence than the commonly used detail caption ability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beepul Bharti, Paul Yi, Jeremias Sulam</p>
<p>Abstract: As complex machine learning models continue to find applications in high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it is crucial that we can explain and understand their predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods provide useful insights by identifying important features in an input $\mathbf{x}$ with respect to the model output $f(\mathbf{x})$. In this work, we formalize and study two precise notions of feature importance for general machine learning models: sufficiency and necessity. We demonstrate how these two types of explanations, albeit intuitive and simple, can fall short in providing a complete picture of which features a model finds important. To this end, we propose a unified notion of importance that circumvents these limitations by exploring a continuum along a necessity-sufficiency axis. Our unified notion, we show, has strong ties to other popular definitions of feature importance, like those based on conditional independence and game-theoretic quantities like Shapley values. Crucially, we demonstrate how a unified perspective allows us to detect important features that could be missed by either of the previous approaches alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugenio Lomurno, Samuele Mariani, Matteo Monti, Matteo Matteucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates neural network design, reducing dependence on human expertise. While NAS methods are computationally intensive and dataset-specific, auxiliary predictors reduce the models needing training, decreasing search time. This strategy is used to generate architectures satisfying multiple computational constraints. Recently, Transferable NAS has emerged, generalizing the search process from dataset-dependent to task-dependent. In this field, DiffusionNAG is a state-of-the-art method. This diffusion-based approach streamlines computation, generating architectures optimized for accuracy on unseen datasets without further adaptation. However, by focusing solely on accuracy, DiffusionNAG overlooks other crucial objectives like model complexity, computational efficiency, and inference latency -- factors essential for deploying models in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces the Pareto-Optimal Many-Objective Neural Architecture Generator (POMONAG), extending DiffusionNAG via a many-objective diffusion process. POMONAG simultaneously considers accuracy, number of parameters, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and inference latency. It integrates Performance Predictor models to estimate these metrics and guide diffusion gradients. POMONAG's optimization is enhanced by expanding its training Meta-Dataset, applying Pareto Front Filtering, and refining embeddings for conditional generation. These enhancements enable POMONAG to generate Pareto-optimal architectures that outperform the previous state-of-the-art in performance and efficiency. Results were validated on two search spaces -- NASBench201 and MobileNetV3 -- and evaluated across 15 image classification datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dung Ha Nguyen, Anh Thi Hoang Nguyen, Kiet Van Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces an innovative automatic labeling framework to address the challenges of lexical normalization in social media texts for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. Social media data is rich and diverse, but the evolving and varied language used in these contexts makes manual labeling labor-intensive and expensive. To tackle these issues, we propose a framework that integrates semi-supervised learning with weak supervision techniques. This approach enhances the quality of training dataset and expands its size while minimizing manual labeling efforts. Our framework automatically labels raw data, converting non-standard vocabulary into standardized forms, thereby improving the accuracy and consistency of the training data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our weak supervision framework in normalizing Vietnamese text, especially when utilizing Pre-trained Language Models. The proposed framework achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.72% and maintains vocabulary integrity with an accuracy of up to 99.22%. Additionally, it effectively handles undiacritized text under various conditions. This framework significantly enhances natural language normalization quality and improves the accuracy of various NLP tasks, leading to an average accuracy increase of 1-3%.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework COLLAGE for generating collaborative agent-object-agent interactions by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and hierarchical motion-specific vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). Our model addresses the lack of rich datasets in this domain by incorporating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to guide a generative diffusion model.

We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling complex interactions in various domains, such as robotics, graphics and computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingfang Wu, Heng Li, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems. State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors. However, the impacts of these different types of information are not clear. In addition, existing approaches have not captured the timestamps in the log data, which can potentially provide more fine-grained temporal information than sequential information. In this work, we propose a configurable transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's features. Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs. With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly detection. When presented with log sequences of varying lengths, the model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance compared to the baselines. The results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection in the studied public datasets. On the other hand, the findings also reveal the simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the extent of recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks, providing formal guarantees on the behavior of these systems is still an open problem, and a crucial requirement for their adoption in regulated or safety-critical scenarios. We consider the task of training differentiable ML models guaranteed to satisfy designer-chosen properties, stated as input-output implications. This is very challenging, due to the computational complexity of rigorously verifying and enforcing compliance in modern neural models. We provide an innovative approach based on three components: 1) a general, simple architecture enabling efficient verification with a conservative semantic; 2) a rigorous training algorithm based on the Projected Gradient Method; 3) a formulation of the problem of searching for strong counterexamples. The proposed framework, being only marginally affected by model complexity, scales well to practical applications, and produces models that provide full property satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate our approach on properties defined by linear inequalities in regression, and on mutually exclusive classes in multilabel classification. Our approach is competitive with a baseline that includes property enforcement during preprocessing, i.e. on the training data, as well as during postprocessing, i.e. on the model predictions. Finally, our contributions establish a framework that opens up multiple research directions and potential improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study off-dynamics Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the policy training and deployment environments are different. To deal with this environmental perturbation, we focus on learning policies robust to uncertainties in transition dynamics under the framework of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs), where the nominal and perturbed dynamics are linear Markov Decision Processes. We propose a novel algorithm We-DRIVE-U that enjoys an average suboptimality $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big({d H \cdot \min \{1/{\rho}, H\}/\sqrt{K} }\big)$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the horizon length, $d$ is the feature dimension and $\rho$ is the uncertainty level. This result improves the state-of-the-art by $\mathcal{O}(dH/\min\{1/\rho,H\})$. We also construct a novel hard instance and derive the first information-theoretic lower bound in this setting, which indicates our algorithm is near-optimal up to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{H})$ for any uncertainty level $\rho\in(0,1]$. Our algorithm also enjoys a 'rare-switching' design, and thus only requires $\mathcal{O}(dH\log(1+H^2K))$ policy switches and $\mathcal{O}(d^2H\log(1+H^2K))$ calls for oracle to solve dual optimization problems, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing algorithms for DRMDPs, whose policy switch and oracle complexities are both $\mathcal{O}(K)$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human language, while aimed at conveying meaning, inherently carries ambiguity. It poses challenges for speech and language processing, but also serves crucial communicative functions. Efficiently solve ambiguity is both a desired and a necessary characteristic. The lexical meaning of a word in context can be determined automatically by Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms that rely on external knowledge often limited and biased toward English. When adapting content to other languages, automated translations are frequently inaccurate and a high degree of expert human validation is necessary to ensure both accuracy and understanding. The current study addresses previous limitations by introducing a new resource for Spanish WSD. It includes a sense inventory and a lexical dataset sourced from the Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\~nola which is maintained by the Real Academia Espa\~nola.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Robi Butler, a novel household robotic system that enables multimodal interactions with remote users. Building on the advanced communication interfaces, Robi Butler allows users to monitor the robot's status, send text or voice instructions, and select target objects by hand pointing.

These plans are composed of a set of open vocabulary primitives supported by Vision Language Models (VLMs) that handle both text and pointing queries. The integration of the above components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in the real-world home environment in a zero-shot manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this system using a variety of daily household tasks that involve remote users giving multimodal instructions. Additionally, we conducted a user study to analyze how multimodal interactions affect efficiency and user experience during remote human-robot interaction and discuss the potential improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code generation aims to automatically generate code from input requirements, significantly enhancing development efficiency. Recent large language models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results and revolutionized code generation task. Despite the promising performance, LLMs often generate contents with hallucinations, especially for the code generation scenario requiring the handling of complex contextual dependencies in practical development process. Although previous study has analyzed hallucinations in LLM-powered code generation, the study is limited to standalone function generation. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to study the phenomena, mechanism, and mitigation of LLM hallucinations within more practical and complex development contexts in repository-level generation scenario. First, we manually examine the code generation results from six mainstream LLMs to establish a hallucination taxonomy of LLM-generated code. Next, we elaborate on the phenomenon of hallucinations, analyze their distribution across different models. We then analyze causes of hallucinations and identify four potential factors contributing to hallucinations. Finally, we propose an RAG-based mitigation method, which demonstrates consistent effectiveness in all studied LLMs. The replication package including code, data, and experimental results is available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/LLMCodingHallucination</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) possess a strong capability to comprehend natural language, making them effective in translating human instructions into detailed plans for simple robot tasks. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge to handle long-horizon tasks, especially in subtask identification and allocation for cooperative heterogeneous robot teams. To address this issue, we propose a Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent PDDL Planner (LaMMA-P), a novel multi-agent task planning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon tasks. LaMMA-P integrates the strengths of the LMs' reasoning capability and the traditional heuristic search planner to achieve a high success rate and efficiency while demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Additionally, we create MAT-THOR, a comprehensive benchmark that features household tasks with two different levels of complexity based on the AI2-THOR environment. The experimental results demonstrate that LaMMA-P achieves a 105% higher success rate and 36% higher efficiency than existing LM-based multi-agent planners.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Nurul Muttakin, Md Iqbal Hossain, Md Saidur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Overlapping community detection is a key problem in graph mining. Some research has considered applying graph convolutional networks (GCN) to tackle the problem. However, it is still challenging to incorporate deep graph convolutional networks in the case of general irregular graphs. In this study, we design a deep dynamic residual graph convolutional network (DynaResGCN) based on our novel dynamic dilated aggregation mechanisms and a unified end-to-end encoder-decoder-based framework to detect overlapping communities in networks. The deep DynaResGCN model is used as the encoder, whereas we incorporate the Bernoulli-Poisson (BP) model as the decoder. Consequently, we apply our overlapping community detection framework in a research topics dataset without having ground truth, a set of networks from Facebook having a reliable (hand-labeled) ground truth, and in a set of very large co-authorship networks having empirical (not hand-labeled) ground truth. Our experimentation on these datasets shows significantly superior performance over many state-of-the-art methods for the detection of overlapping communities in networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Sophie Wang, Nutchanon Yongsatianchot, Stacy Marsella</p>
<p>Abstract: Hurricanes cause significant economic and human costs, requiring individuals to make critical evacuation decisions under uncertainty and stress. To enhance the understanding of this decision-making process, we propose using Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model evacuation decisions during hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from two significant hurricane events: Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. We employed a data-driven approach by first conducting variable selection using mutual information, followed by BN structure learning with two constraint-based algorithms. The robustness of the learned structures was enhanced by model averaging based on bootstrap resampling. We examined and compared the learned structures of both hurricanes, revealing potential causal relationships among key predictors of evacuation, including risk perception, information received from media, suggestions from family and friends, and neighbors evacuating. Our findings highlight the significant role of social influence, providing valuable insights into the process of evacuation decision-making. Our results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of data-driven BN modeling in evacuation decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Troquard, Martina De Sanctis, Paola Inverardi, Patrizio Pelliccione, Gian Luca Scoccia</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of AI-based and autonomous systems is raising concerns and apprehension due to potential negative repercussions stemming from their behavior or decisions. These systems must be designed to comply with the human contexts in which they will operate. To this extent, Townsend et al. (2022) introduce the concept of SLEEC (social, legal, ethical, empathetic, or cultural) rules that aim to facilitate the formulation, verification, and enforcement of the rules AI-based and autonomous systems should obey. They lay out a methodology to elicit them and to let philosophers, lawyers, domain experts, and others to formulate them in natural language. To enable their effective use in AI systems, it is necessary to translate these rules systematically into a formal language that supports automated reasoning. In this study, we first conduct a linguistic analysis of the SLEEC rules pattern, which justifies the translation of SLEEC rules into classical logic. Then we investigate the computational complexity of reasoning about SLEEC rules and show how logical programming frameworks can be employed to implement SLEEC rules in practical scenarios. The result is a readily applicable strategy for implementing AI systems that conform to norms expressed as SLEEC rules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Ge, Hongzhe Huang, Mingze Zhou, Juncheng Li, Guoming Wang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: World models are progressively being employed across diverse fields, extending from basic environment simulation to complex scenario construction. However, existing models are mainly trained on domain-specific states and actions, and confined to single-modality state representations. In this paper, We introduce WorldGPT, a generalist world model built upon Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). WorldGPT acquires an understanding of world dynamics through analyzing millions of videos across various domains. To further enhance WorldGPT's capability in specialized scenarios and long-term tasks, we have integrated it with a novel cognitive architecture that combines memory offloading, knowledge retrieval, and context reflection. As for evaluation, we build WorldNet, a multimodal state transition prediction benchmark encompassing varied real-life scenarios. Conducting evaluations on WorldNet directly demonstrates WorldGPT's capability to accurately model state transition patterns, affirming its effectiveness in understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex scenarios. We further explore WorldGPT's emerging potential in serving as a world simulator, helping multimodal agents generalize to unfamiliar domains through efficiently synthesising multimodal instruction instances which are proved to be as reliable as authentic data for fine-tuning purposes. The project is available on \url{https://github.com/DCDmllm/WorldGPT}.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field is flooded with optimisation methods. In this paper, we change the focus to developing modelling methods with the aim of getting us closer to Artificial General Intelligence. To do so, we propose a novel way to interpret reality as an information source, that is later translated into a computational framework able to capture and represent such information. This framework is able to build elements of classical cognitive architectures, like Long Term Memory and Working Memory, starting from a simple primitive that only processes Spatial Distributed Representations. Moreover, it achieves such level of verticality in a seamless scalable hierarchical way.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current research on tool learning primarily focuses on selecting the most effective tool from a wide array of options, often overlooking cost-effectiveness, a crucial factor in human problem-solving. In this paper, we address the selection of homogeneous tools by predicting both their performance and the associated cost required to accomplish a given task. We then assign queries to the optimal tools in a cost-effective manner. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance at a lower cost compared to strong baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gihun Lee, Minchan Jeong, Yujin Kim, Hojung Jung, Jaehoon Oh, Sangmook Kim, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: While learning to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences has shown remarkable success, aligning these models to meet the diverse user preferences presents further challenges in preserving previous knowledge. This paper examines the impact of personalized preference optimization on LLMs, revealing that the extent of knowledge loss varies significantly with preference heterogeneity. Although previous approaches have utilized the KL constraint between the reference model and the policy model, we observe that they fail to maintain general knowledge and alignment when facing personalized preferences. To this end, we introduce Base-Anchored Preference Optimization (BAPO), a simple yet effective approach that utilizes the initial responses of reference model to mitigate forgetting while accommodating personalized alignment. BAPO effectively adapts to diverse user preferences while minimally affecting global knowledge or general alignment. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BAPO in various setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iris Dumeur (CESBIO), Silvia Valero (CESBIO), Jordi Inglada (CESBIO)</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses. As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayabrata Chowdhury, Venkataramanan Shivaraman, Sumit Dangi, Suresh Sundaram, P. B. Sujit</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) decision making in urban environments is inherently challenging due to the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles. For safe planning, AV must understand the weightage of various spatiotemporal interactions in a scene. Contemporary works use colossal transformer architectures to encode interactions mainly for trajectory prediction, resulting in increased computational complexity. To address this issue without compromising spatiotemporal understanding and performance, we propose the simple Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DADRL) framework, which dynamically assigns and incorporates the significance of surrounding vehicles into the ego's RL driven decision making process. We introduce an AV centric spatiotemporal attention encoding (STAE) mechanism for learning the dynamic interactions with different surrounding vehicles. To understand map and route context, we employ a context encoder to extract features from context maps. The spatiotemporal representations combined with contextual encoding provide a comprehensive state representation. The resulting model is trained using the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm. We evaluate the proposed framework on the SMARTS urban benchmarking scenarios without traffic signals to demonstrate that DADRL outperforms recent state of the art methods. Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the importance of the context-encoder and spatio temporal attention encoder in achieving superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-tse Huang, Jiaxu Zhou, Tailin Jin, Xuhui Zhou, Zixi Chen, Wenxuan Wang, Youliang Yuan, Maarten Sap, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems, powered by large language models, have shown great abilities across various tasks due to the collaboration of expert agents, each focusing on a specific domain. However, when agents are deployed separately, there is a risk that malicious users may introduce malicious agents who generate incorrect or irrelevant results that are too stealthy to be identified by other non-specialized agents. Therefore, this paper investigates two essential questions: (1) What is the resilience of various multi-agent system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under malicious agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against malicious agents? To simulate malicious agents, we devise two methods, AutoTransform and AutoInject, to transform any agent into a malicious one while preserving its functional integrity. We run comprehensive experiments on four downstream multi-agent systems tasks, namely code generation, math problems, translation, and text evaluation. Results suggest that the "hierarchical" multi-agent structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of $23.6\%$, compared to $46.4\%$ and $49.8\%$ of other two structures. Additionally, we show the promise of improving multi-agent system resilience by demonstrating that two defense methods, introducing a mechanism for each agent to challenge others' outputs, or an additional agent to review and correct messages, can enhance system resilience.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan C. Rosero, Ivana Dusparic, Nicol\'as Cardozo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used extensively in Autonomous Systems (AS) as it enables learning at runtime without the need for a model of the environment or predefined actions. However, most applications of RL in AS, such as those based on Q-learning, can only optimize one objective, making it necessary in multi-objective systems to combine multiple objectives in a single objective function with predefined weights. A number of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) techniques exist but they have mostly been applied in RL benchmarks rather than real-world AS systems. In this work, we use a MORL technique called Deep W-Learning (DWN) and apply it to the Emergent Web Servers exemplar, a self-adaptive server, to find the optimal configuration for runtime performance optimization. We compare DWN to two single-objective optimization implementations: {\epsilon}-greedy algorithm and Deep Q-Networks. Our initial evaluation shows that DWN optimizes multiple objectives simultaneously with similar results than DQN and {\epsilon}-greedy approaches, having a better performance for some metrics, and avoids issues associated with combining multiple objectives into a single utility function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maris F. L. Galesloot, Marnix Suilen, Thiago D. Sim\~ao, Steven Carr, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Ufuk Topcu, Nils Jansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust partially observable Markov decision processes (robust POMDPs) extend classical POMDPs to handle additional uncertainty on the transition and observation probabilities via so-called uncertainty sets. Policies for robust POMDPs must not only be memory-based to account for partial observability but also robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case instances from the uncertainty sets. We propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which finds robust memory-based policies for robust POMDPs. PIP alternates between two main steps: (1) selecting an adversarial (non-robust) POMDP via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets; and (2) computing a finite-state controller (FSC) for this adversarial POMDP. We evaluate the performance of this FSC on the original robust POMDP and use this evaluation in step (1) to select the next adversarial POMDP. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm. In each iteration, rFSCNet finds an FSC through a recurrent neural network by using supervision policies optimized for the adversarial POMDP. The empirical evaluation in four benchmark environments showcases improved robustness against several baseline methods and competitive performance compared to a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee, Yinan Yu, Robert Feldt, Andris Freimanis, Patrick Andersson Rhodin, Dhasarathy Parthasarathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for making software deployment decisions in the automotive industry typically rely on manual analysis of tabular software test data. These methods often lead to higher costs and delays in the software release cycle due to their labor-intensive nature. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges. However, their application generally demands multiple rounds of human-driven prompt engineering, which limits their practical deployment, particularly for industrial end-users who need reliable and efficient results. In this paper, we propose GoNoGo, an LLM agent system designed to streamline automotive software deployment while meeting both functional requirements and practical industrial constraints. Unlike previous systems, GoNoGo is specifically tailored to address domain-specific and risk-sensitive systems. We evaluate GoNoGo's performance across different task difficulties using zero-shot and few-shot examples taken from industrial practice. Our results show that GoNoGo achieves a 100% success rate for tasks up to Level 2 difficulty with 3-shot examples, and maintains high performance even for more complex tasks. We find that GoNoGo effectively automates decision-making for simpler tasks, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. In summary, GoNoGo represents an efficient and user-friendly LLM-based solution currently employed in our industrial partner's company to assist with software release decision-making, supporting more informed and timely decisions in the release process for risk-sensitive vehicle systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshko Koloski, Senja Pollak, Roberto Navigli, Bla\v{z} \v{S}krlj</p>
<p>Abstract: Large semantic knowledge bases are grounded in factual knowledge. However, recent approaches to dense text representations (i.e. embeddings) do not efficiently exploit these resources. Dense and robust representations of documents are essential for effectively solving downstream classification and retrieval tasks. This work demonstrates that injecting embedded information from knowledge bases can augment the performance of contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based representations for the task of text classification. Further, by considering automated machine learning (AutoML) with the fused representation space, we demonstrate it is possible to improve classification accuracy even if we use low-dimensional projections of the original representation space obtained via efficient matrix factorization. This result shows that significantly faster classifiers can be achieved with minimal or no loss in predictive performance, as demonstrated using five strong LLM baselines on six diverse real-life datasets.

<p>Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewan Park, Shashank Kushwaha, Junyan He, Seid Koric, Qibang Liu, Iwona Jasiuk, Diab Abueidda</p>
<p>Abstract: Metamaterials, synthetic materials with customized properties, have emerged as a promising field due to advancements in additive manufacturing. These materials derive unique mechanical properties from their internal lattice structures, which are often composed of multiple materials that repeat geometric patterns. While traditional inverse design approaches have shown potential, they struggle to map nonlinear material behavior to multiple possible structural configurations. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging video diffusion models, a type of generative artificial Intelligence (AI), for inverse multi-material design based on nonlinear stress-strain responses. Our approach consists of two key components: (1) a fields generator using a video diffusion model to create solution fields based on target nonlinear stress-strain responses, and (2) a structure identifier employing two UNet models to determine the corresponding multi-material 2D design. By incorporating multiple materials, plasticity, and large deformation, our innovative design method allows for enhanced control over the highly nonlinear mechanical behavior of metamaterials commonly seen in real-world applications. It offers a promising solution for generating next-generation metamaterials with finely tuned mechanical characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report outlines our approach for the WMT24 Discourse-Level Literary Translation Task, focusing on the Chinese-English language pair in the Constrained Track. Translating literary texts poses significant challenges due to the nuanced meanings, idiomatic expressions, and intricate narrative structures inherent in such works. To address these challenges, we leveraged the Chinese-Llama2 model, specifically enhanced for this task through a combination of Continual Pre-training (CPT) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our methodology includes a novel Incremental Decoding framework, which ensures that each sentence is translated with consideration of its broader context, maintaining coherence and consistency throughout the text. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and stylistic elements, producing translations that faithfully preserve the original literary quality. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both sentence-level and document-level BLEU scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed framework in addressing the complexities of document-level literary translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic clustering properties of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video games, enriching our understanding of the internal dynamics of DRL and advancing its interpretability. In this context, semantic clustering refers to the inherent capacity of neural networks to internally group video inputs based on semantic similarity. To achieve this, we propose a novel DRL architecture that integrates a semantic clustering module featuring both feature dimensionality reduction and online clustering. This module seamlessly integrates into the DRL training pipeline, addressing instability issues observed in previous t-SNE-based analysis methods and eliminating the necessity for extensive manual annotation of semantic analysis. Through experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed module and the semantic clustering properties in DRL for video games. Additionally, based on these properties, we introduce new analytical methods to help understand the hierarchical structure of policies and the semantic distribution within the feature space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Chen, Xiao Sun, Zhi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual emotion analysis holds significant research value in both computer vision and psychology. However, existing methods for visual emotion analysis suffer from limited generalizability due to the ambiguity of emotion perception and the diversity of data scenarios. To tackle this issue, we introduce UniEmoX, a cross-modal semantic-guided large-scale pretraining framework. Inspired by psychological research emphasizing the inseparability of the emotional exploration process from the interaction between individuals and their environment, UniEmoX integrates scene-centric and person-centric low-level image spatial structural information, aiming to derive more nuanced and discriminative emotional representations. By exploiting the similarity between paired and unpaired image-text samples, UniEmoX distills rich semantic knowledge from the CLIP model to enhance emotional embedding representations more effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale pretraining framework that integrates psychological theories with contemporary contrastive learning and masked image modeling techniques for emotion analysis across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we develop a visual emotional dataset titled Emo8. Emo8 samples cover a range of domains, including cartoon, natural, realistic, science fiction and advertising cover styles, covering nearly all common emotional scenes. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets across two downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of UniEmoX.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiupeng Shi, Yiik Diew Wong, Chen Chai, Michael Zhi-Feng Li, Tianyi Chen, Zeng Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Early risk diagnosis and driving anomaly detection from vehicle stream are of great benefits in a range of advanced solutions towards Smart Road and crash prevention, although there are intrinsic challenges, especially lack of ground truth, definition of multiple risk exposures. This study proposes a domain-specific automatic clustering (termed Autocluster) to self-learn the optimal models for unsupervised risk assessment, which integrates key steps of risk clustering into an auto-optimisable pipeline, including feature and algorithm selection, hyperparameter auto-tuning. Firstly, based on surrogate conflict measures, indicator-guided feature extraction is conducted to construct temporal-spatial and kinematical risk features. Then we develop an elimination-based model reliance importance (EMRI) method to unsupervised-select the useful features. Secondly, we propose balanced Silhouette Index (bSI) to evaluate the internal quality of imbalanced clustering. A loss function is designed that considers the clustering performance in terms of internal quality, inter-cluster variation, and model stability. Thirdly, based on Bayesian optimisation, the algorithm selection and hyperparameter auto-tuning are self-learned to generate the best clustering partitions. Various algorithms are comprehensively investigated. Herein, NGSIM vehicle trajectory data is used for test-bedding. Findings show that Autocluster is reliable and promising to diagnose multiple distinct risk exposures inherent to generalised driving behaviour. Besides, we also delve into risk clustering, such as, algorithms heterogeneity, Silhouette analysis, hierarchical clustering flows, etc. Meanwhile, the Autocluster is also a method for unsupervised multi-risk data labelling and indicator threshold calibration. Furthermore, Autocluster is useful to tackle the challenges in imbalanced clustering without ground truth or priori knowledge</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thulitha Senevirathna, Vinh Hoa La, Samuel Marchal, Bartlomiej Siniarski, Madhusanka Liyanage, Shen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of 5G commercialization, the need for more reliable, faster, and intelligent telecommunication systems is envisaged for the next generation beyond 5G (B5G) radio access technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are immensely popular in service layer applications and have been proposed as essential enablers in many aspects of 5G and beyond networks, from IoT devices and edge computing to cloud-based infrastructures. However, existing 5G ML-based security surveys tend to emphasize AI/ML model performance and accuracy more than the models' accountability and trustworthiness. In contrast, this paper explores the potential of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, which would allow stakeholders in 5G and beyond to inspect intelligent black-box systems used to secure next-generation networks. The goal of using XAI in the security domain of 5G and beyond is to allow the decision-making processes of ML-based security systems to be transparent and comprehensible to 5G and beyond stakeholders, making the systems accountable for automated actions. In every facet of the forthcoming B5G era, including B5G technologies such as ORAN, zero-touch network management, and end-to-end slicing, this survey emphasizes the role of XAI in them that the general users would ultimately enjoy. Furthermore, we presented the lessons from recent efforts and future research directions on top of the currently conducted projects involving XAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Saeid Amiri, Nieqing Cao, Hao Yang, Chad Esselink, Shiqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated task planning algorithms have been developed to help robots complete complex tasks that require multiple actions. Most of those algorithms have been developed for "closed worlds" assuming complete world knowledge is provided. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner's completeness. This paper introduces a novel algorithm (COWP) for open-world task planning and situation handling that dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge with task-oriented common sense. In particular, common sense is extracted from Large Language Models based on the current task at hand and robot skills. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 561 execution-time situations in a dining domain, where each situation corresponds to a state instance of a robot being potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. The project website is available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/, where a more detailed version can also be found. This version has been accepted for publication in Autonomous Robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb Ju, Guanghui Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) problems over general state and action spaces are notoriously challenging. In contrast to the tableau setting, one can not enumerate all the states and then iteratively update the policies for each state. This prevents the application of many well-studied RL methods especially those with provable convergence guarantees. In this paper, we first present a substantial generalization of the recently developed policy mirror descent method to deal with general state and action spaces. We introduce new approaches to incorporate function approximation into this method, so that we do not need to use explicit policy parameterization at all. Moreover, we present a novel policy dual averaging method for which possibly simpler function approximation techniques can be applied. We establish linear convergence rate to global optimality or sublinear convergence to stationarity for these methods applied to solve different classes of RL problems under exact policy evaluation. We then define proper notions of the approximation errors for policy evaluation and investigate their impact on the convergence of these methods applied to general-state RL problems with either finite-action or continuous-action spaces. To the best of our knowledge, the development of these algorithmic frameworks as well as their convergence analysis appear to be new in the literature. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate the robustness of the aforementioned methods and show they can be competitive with state-of-the-art RL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaesung Huh, Jacob Chalk, Evangelos Kazakos, Dima Damen, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Epic-Sounds, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, Epic-Sounds includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Partha Chakraborty, Mahmoud Alfadel, Meiyappan Nagappan</p>
<p>Abstract: Software developers spend a significant portion of time fixing bugs in their projects. To streamline this process, bug localization approaches have been proposed to identify the source code files that are likely responsible for a particular bug. Prior work proposed several similarity-based machine-learning techniques for bug localization. Despite significant advances in these techniques, they do not directly optimize the evaluation measures. We argue that directly optimizing evaluation measures can positively contribute to the performance of bug localization approaches. Therefore, In this paper, we utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to directly optimize the ranking metrics. We propose RLocator, a Reinforcement Learning-based bug localization approach. We formulate RLocator using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to optimize the evaluation measures directly. We present the technique and experimentally evaluate it based on a benchmark dataset of 8,316 bug reports from six highly popular Apache projects. The results of our evaluation reveal that RLocator achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.62, a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.59, and a Top 1 score of 0.46. We compare RLocator with two state-of-the-art bug localization tools, FLIM and BugLocator. Our evaluation reveals that RLocator outperforms both approaches by a substantial margin, with improvements of 38.3% in MAP, 36.73% in MRR, and 23.68% in the Top K metric. These findings highlight that directly optimizing evaluation measures considerably contributes to performance improvement of the bug localization problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: The biomedical literature is rapidly expanding, posing a significant challenge for manual curation and knowledge discovery. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) has emerged as a powerful solution, enabling the automated extraction of information and knowledge from this extensive literature. Recent attention has been directed towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their impressive performance. However, there remains a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of LLMs in BioNLP tasks and their broader implications for method development and downstream users. Currently, there is a lack of baseline performance data, benchmarks, and practical recommendations for using LLMs in the biomedical domain. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of four representative LLMs: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (closed-source), LLaMA 2 (open-sourced), and PMC LLaMA (domain-specific) across 12 BioNLP datasets covering six applications (named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question answering, text summarization, and text simplification). The evaluation is conducted under four settings: zero-shot, static few-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning. We compare these models against state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches that fine-tune (domain-specific) BERT or BART models, which are well-established methods in BioNLP tasks. The evaluation covers both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, where the latter involves manually reviewing collectively hundreds of thousands of LLM outputs for inconsistencies, missing information, and hallucinations in extractive and classification tasks. The qualitative review also examines accuracy, 1 completeness, and readability in text summarization tasks. Additionally, a cost analysis of closed-source GPT models is conducted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongho Kang, Jin Cheng, Miguel Zamora, Fatemeh Zargarbashi, Stelian Coros</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a control framework that combines model-based optimal control and reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve versatile and robust legged locomotion. Our approach enhances the RL training process by incorporating on-demand reference motions generated through finite-horizon optimal control, covering a broad range of velocities and gaits. These reference motions serve as targets for the RL policy to imitate, leading to the development of robust control policies that can be learned with reliability. Furthermore, by utilizing realistic simulation data that captures whole-body dynamics, RL effectively overcomes the inherent limitations in reference motions imposed by modeling simplifications. We validate the robustness and controllability of the RL training process within our framework through a series of experiments. In these experiments, our method showcases its capability to generalize reference motions and effectively handle more complex locomotion tasks that may pose challenges for the simplified model, thanks to RL's flexibility. Additionally, our framework effortlessly supports the training of control policies for robots with diverse dimensions, eliminating the necessity for robot-specific adjustments in the reward function and hyperparameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data quality is crucial for the successful training, generalization and performance of machine learning models. We propose to measure the quality of a subset concerning the dataset it represents, using topological data analysis techniques. Specifically, we define the persistence matching diagram, a topological invariant derived from combining embeddings with persistent homology. We provide an algorithm to compute it using minimum spanning trees. Also, the invariant allows us to understand whether the subset ``represents well" the clusters from the larger dataset or not, and we also use it to estimate bounds for the Hausdorff distance between the subset and the complete dataset. In particular, this approach enables us to explain why the chosen subset is likely to result in poor performance of a supervised learning model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob-Junqi Tian, Omkar Dige, D. B. Emerson, Faiza Khan Khattak</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast, uncurated datasets that contain various forms of biases and language reinforcing harmful stereotypes that may be subsequently inherited by the models themselves. Therefore, it is essential to examine and address biases in language models, integrating fairness into their development to ensure that these models do not perpetuate social biases. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of reasoning in zero-shot stereotype identification across several open-source LLMs. Accurate identification of stereotypical language is a complex task requiring a nuanced understanding of social structures, biases, and existing unfair generalizations about particular groups. While improved accuracy is observed through model scaling, the use of reasoning, especially multi-step reasoning, is crucial to consistent performance. Additionally, through a qualitative analysis of select reasoning traces, we highlight how reasoning improves not just accuracy, but also the interpretability of model decisions. This work firmly establishes reasoning as a critical component in automatic stereotype detection and is a first step towards stronger stereotype mitigation pipelines for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Feng, Alberto Huertas Celdran, Pedro Miguel Sanchez Sanchez, Jan Kreischer, Jan von der Assen, Gerome Bovet, Gregorio Martinez Perez, Burkhard Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Moving Target Defense (MTD) can enhance cybersecurity in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Nevertheless, the practicality of existing work is hindered by data privacy concerns associated with centralized data processing in RL, and the unsatisfactory time needed to learn right MTD techniques that are effective against a rising number of heterogeneous zero-day attacks. Thus, this work presents CyberForce, a framework that combines Federated and Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to collaboratively and privately learn suitable MTD techniques for mitigating zero-day attacks. CyberForce integrates device fingerprinting and anomaly detection to reward or penalize MTD mechanisms chosen by an FRL-based agent. The framework has been deployed and evaluated in a scenario consisting of ten physical devices of a real IoT platform affected by heterogeneous malware samples. A pool of experiments has demonstrated that CyberForce learns the MTD technique mitigating each attack faster than existing RL-based centralized approaches. In addition, when various devices are exposed to different attacks, CyberForce benefits from knowledge transfer, leading to enhanced performance and reduced learning time in comparison to recent works. Finally, different aggregation algorithms used during the agent learning process provide CyberForce with notable robustness to malicious attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yewon Lee, Andrew Z. Li, Philip Huang, Eric Heiden, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, Fabian Damken, Kevin Smith, Derek Nowrouzezahrai, Fabio Ramos, Florian Shkurti</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning for sequential robotics tasks often requires integrated symbolic and geometric reasoning. TAMP algorithms typically solve these problems by performing a tree search over high-level task sequences while checking for kinematic and dynamic feasibility. This can be inefficient because, typically, candidate task plans resulting from the tree search ignore geometric information. This often leads to motion planning failures that require expensive backtracking steps to find alternative task plans. We propose a novel approach to TAMP called Stein Task and Motion Planning (STAMP) that relaxes the hybrid optimization problem into a continuous domain. This allows us to leverage gradients from differentiable physics simulation to fully optimize discrete and continuous plan parameters for TAMP. In particular, we solve the optimization problem using a gradient-based variational inference algorithm called Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This allows us to find a distribution of solutions within a single optimization run. Furthermore, we use an off-the-shelf differentiable physics simulator that is parallelized on the GPU to run parallelized inference over diverse plan parameters. We demonstrate our method on a variety of problems and show that it can find multiple diverse plans in a single optimization run while also being significantly faster than existing approaches.</p>

With the dummy player, the learning can be formulated as a two-player zero-sum game. The proposed DAQ unifies several Q-learning variations to control overestimation biases, such as maxmin Q-learning and minmax Q-learning (proposed in this paper) in a single framework. The proposed DAQ is a simple but effective way to suppress the overestimation bias thourgh dummy adversarial behaviors and can be easily applied to off-the-shelf reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the performances. A finite-time convergence of DAQ is analyzed from an integrated perspective by adapting an adversarial Q-learning. The performance of the suggested DAQ is empirically demonstrated under various benchmark environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Zhang, Zhaobo Hua, Jinliang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of intelligent robots requires control policies that can handle dynamic environments and evolving tasks. Pre-training reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective approach to address these demands by enabling robots to acquire reusable motor skills. However, they often rely on large datasets or expert-designed goal spaces, limiting adaptability. Additionally, these methods need help to generate dynamic and diverse skills in high-dimensional state spaces, reducing their effectiveness for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose CMS-PRL, a pre-training reinforcement learning method inspired by the Central Motor System (CMS). First, we introduce a fusion reward mechanism that combines the basic motor reward with mutual information reward, promoting the discovery of dynamic skills during pre-training without reliance on external data. Second, we design a skill encoding method inspired by the motor program of the basal ganglia, providing rich and continuous skill instructions during pre-training. Finally, we propose a skill activity function to regulate motor skill activity, enabling the generation of skills with different activity levels, thereby enhancing the robot's flexibility in downstream tasks. We evaluate the model on four types of robots in a challenging set of sparse-reward tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CMS-PRL generates diverse, reusable motor skills to solve various downstream tasks and outperforms baseline methods, particularly in high-degree-of-freedom robots and complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keunwoo Peter Yu, Zheyuan Zhang, Fengyuan Hu, Shane Storks, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: A major reason behind the recent success of large language models (LLMs) is their \textit{in-context learning} capability, which makes it possible to rapidly adapt them to downstream text-based tasks by prompting them with a small number of relevant demonstrations. While large vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been developed for tasks requiring both text and images, they largely lack in-context learning over visual information, especially in understanding and generating text about videos. In this work, we implement \textbf{E}mergent \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{Le}arning on \textbf{V}ideos (\eilev{}), a novel training paradigm that induces in-context learning over video and text by capturing key properties of pre-training data found by prior work to be essential for in-context learning in transformers. In our experiments, we show that \eilev-trained models outperform other off-the-shelf VLMs in few-shot video narration for novel, rare actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these key properties of bursty distributions, skewed marginal distributions, and dynamic meaning each contribute to varying degrees to VLMs' in-context learning capability in narrating procedural videos. Our results, analysis, and \eilev{}-trained models yield numerous insights about the emergence of in-context learning over video and text, creating a foundation for future work to optimize and scale VLMs for open-domain video understanding and reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Payam Jome Yazdian, Eric Liu, Rachel Lagasse, Hamid Mohammadi, Li Cheng, Angelica Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes MotionScript, a motion-to-text conversion algorithm and natural language representation for human body motions. MotionScript provides more detailed and accurate descriptions of human body movements compared to previous natural language methods. Most motion datasets focus on basic, well-defined actions, with limited variation in expression (e.g., sitting, walking, dribbling a ball). But for expressive actions that contain a diversity of movements in the class (e.g. being sad, dancing), or for actions outside the domain of standard motion capture datasets (e.g. stylistic walking, sign-language, interactions with animals), more specific and granular natural language descriptions are needed. Our proposed MotionScript descriptions differ from existing natural language representations in that it provides detailed descriptions in natural language rather than simple action labels or generalized captions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at translating 3D motions to natural language descriptions without requiring training data. Our experiments demonstrate that MotionScript descriptions, when applied to text-to-motion tasks, enable large language models to generate complex, previously unseen motions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woochul Kang, Hyungseop Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictable adaptation of network depths can be an effective way to control inference latency and meet the resource condition of various devices. However, previous adaptive depth networks do not provide general principles and a formal explanation on why and which layers can be skipped, and, hence, their approaches are hard to be generalized and require long and complex training steps. In this paper, we present a practical approach to adaptive depth networks that is applicable to various networks with minimal training effort. In our approach, every hierarchical residual stage is divided into two sub-paths, and they are trained to acquire different properties through a simple self-distillation strategy. While the first sub-path is essential for hierarchical feature learning, the second one is trained to refine the learned features and minimize performance degradation if it is skipped. Unlike prior adaptive networks, our approach does not train every target sub-network in an iterative manner. At test time, however, we can connect these sub-paths in a combinatorial manner to select sub-networks of various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs from a single network. We provide a formal rationale for why the proposed training method can reduce overall prediction errors while minimizing the impact of skipping sub-paths. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach with convolutional neural networks and transformers.</p>

Our Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI) is a recurrent neural network architecture equipped with a number of techniques aiming to improve imputation accuracy by aligning the model with the subtle temporal and spatial dependencies typical of clinical data. CSAI a) utilises an attention-based hidden state initialisation to capture long- and short-range correlations within the time-series, b) incorporates a knowledge embedding technique to capture clinical data recording patterns and c) employs a non-uniform masking strategy to adapt its weights to data temporal and cross-sectional missingness patterns. Extensive evaluation of three EHR benchmark data sets demonstrates that CSAI enhances the current state of the art efficacy in data restoration in addition to performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, CSAI is integrated within the PyPOTS Python library for benchmarking, offering open and standardised benchmarking capabilities and ease of use for researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orson Mengara</p>
<p>Abstract: The area of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is experiencing increased implementation due to recent advancements in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) industry. However, this spike has prompted concerns regarding AI defense mechanisms, specifically regarding potential covert attacks from third-party providers that cannot be entirely trusted. Recent research has uncovered that auditory backdoors may use certain modifications as their initiating mechanism. DynamicTrigger is introduced as a methodology for carrying out dynamic backdoor attacks that use cleverly designed tweaks to ensure that corrupted samples are indistinguishable from clean. By utilizing fluctuating signal sampling rates and masking speaker identities through dynamic sound triggers (such as the clapping of hands), it is possible to deceive speech recognition systems (ASR). Our empirical testing demonstrates that DynamicTrigger is both potent and stealthy, achieving impressive success rates during covert attacks while maintaining exceptional accuracy with non-poisoned datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghua Gong, Yao Cheng, Jianxiang Yu, Can Xu, Caihua Shan, Siqiang Luo, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are structured data that models complex relations between real-world entities. Heterophilic graphs, where linked nodes are prone to be with different labels or dissimilar features, have recently attracted significant attention and found many real-world applications. Meanwhile, increasing efforts have been made to advance learning from graphs with heterophily. Various graph heterophily measures, benchmark datasets, and learning paradigms are emerging rapidly. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing works on learning from graphs with heterophily. First, we overview over 500 publications, of which more than 340 are directly related to heterophilic graphs. After that, we survey existing metrics of graph heterophily and list recent benchmark datasets. Further, we systematically categorize existing methods based on a hierarchical taxonomy including GNN models, learning paradigms and practical applications. In addition, broader topics related to graph heterophily are also included. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), a novel probabilistic attention framework that can be used for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), and the Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities, including Speech, Text, and Vision. DAAM integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism, implemented in a multi-head framework, enabling it to collectively model any probability distribution for dynamic recalibration of feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements, especially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art attention techniques in model performance, up to approximately +20% (abs.) in accuracy. Empirically, DAAM exhibits superior adaptability and efficacy across a diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in speech, image classification, and text classification, thereby establishing its robustness and versatility in handling data across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we introduce the Importance Factor, a new learning-based metric that enhances the explainability of models trained with DAAM-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan He, Zhangdie Yuan, Jiaoyan Chen, Ian Horrocks</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengbin Zhu, Ziyang Liu, Fuli Feng, Chao Wang, Moxin Li, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we address question answering (QA) over a hybrid of tabular and textual data that are very common content on the Web (e.g. SEC filings), where discrete reasoning capabilities are often required. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning capabilities. We then consider harnessing the amazing power of LLMs to solve our task. We abstract a Step-wise Pipeline for tabular and textual QA, which consists of three key steps, including Extractor, Reasoner and Executor, and initially design an instruction to instantiate the pipeline and validate that GPT-4 outperforms all existing methods. However, utilizing an online LLM like GPT-4 holds various challenges in terms of cost, latency, and data security risk, which motivates us to specialize smaller LLMs in this task. We develop a TAT-LLM language model by fine-tuning LLaMA 2 with the training data generated automatically from existing expert-annotated datasets following the Step-wise Pipeline. The experimental results have verified that our TAT-LLM model can outperform all baseline models, including the previous best fine-tuned models and very large-scale LLMs like GPT-4 on FinQA, TAT-QA and TAT-DQA benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Xu, Yi Qin, Lu Mi, Hao Wang, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods, such as concept bottleneck models (CBMs), have been successful in providing concept-based interpretations for black-box deep learning models. They typically work by predicting concepts given the input and then predicting the final class label given the predicted concepts. However, (1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., "yellow breast") does not help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., "yellow belly"), leading to suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for an image with the class label "Kentucky Warbler" and a concept "black bill", what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept "black crown"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Our ECBMs use a set of neural networks to define the joint energy of candidate (input, concept, class) tuples. With such a unified interface, prediction, concept correction, and conditional dependency quantification are then represented as conditional probabilities, which are generated by composing different energy functions. Our ECBMs address both limitations of existing CBMs, providing higher accuracy and richer concept interpretations. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manav Singhal, Tushar Aggarwal, Abhijeet Awasthi, Nagarajan Natarajan, Aditya Kanade</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing evaluation benchmarks of language models of code (code LMs) focus almost exclusively on whether the LMs can generate functionally-correct code. In real-world software engineering, developers think beyond functional correctness. They have requirements on "how" a functionality should be implemented to meet overall system design objectives like efficiency, security, and maintainability. They would also trust the code LMs more if the LMs demonstrate robust understanding of such requirements.
  We propose a new benchmark NoFunEval to evaluate code LMs on non-functional requirements and simple classification instances for both functional and non-functional requirements. We propose a prompting method, Coding Concepts (CoCo), as a way for a developer to communicate the domain knowledge to the LMs. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 27 code LMs. Our finding is that LMs generally falter when tested on our benchmark, hinting at fundamental blindspots in their training setups. Surprisingly, even the classification accuracy on functional-correctness instances derived from the popular HumanEval benchmark is low, calling in question the depth of their comprehension and the source of their success in generating functionally-correct code in the first place. We release our benchmark and evaluation scripts publicly at https://aka.ms/NoFunEval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixing Xiao, Ruixiao Shi, Xiaoyang Tang, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous works on object detection have achieved high accuracy in closed-set scenarios, but their performance in open-world scenarios is not satisfactory. One of the challenging open-world problems is corner case detection in autonomous driving. Existing detectors struggle with these cases, relying heavily on visual appearance and exhibiting poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a solution by reducing the discrepancy between known and unknown classes and introduce a multimodal-enhanced objectness notion learner. Leveraging both vision-centric and image-text modalities, our semi-supervised learning framework imparts objectness knowledge to the student model, enabling class-aware detection. Our approach, Multimodal-Enhanced Objectness Learner (MENOL) for Corner Case Detection, significantly improves recall for novel classes with lower training costs. By achieving a 76.6% mAR-corner and 79.8% mAR-agnostic on the CODA-val dataset with just 5100 labeled training images, MENOL outperforms the baseline ORE by 71.3% and 60.6%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Taubenfeld, Yaniv Dover, Roi Reichart, Ariel Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), has opened exciting possibilities for constructing computational simulations designed to replicate human behavior accurately. Current research suggests that LLM-based agents become increasingly human-like in their performance, sparking interest in using these AI agents as substitutes for human participants in behavioral studies. However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. Hence, it is crucial to study and pinpoint the key behavioral distinctions between humans and LLM-based agents. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs' ability to simulate political debates on topics that are important aspects of people's day-to-day lives and decision-making processes. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei Iino, Shunsuke Akamatsu, Hiroshi Watanabe, Shohei Enomoto, Akira Sakamoto, Takeharu Eda</p>
<p>Abstract: Image coding for machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine analysis using recognition models rather than human vision. Hence, in ICM, it is important for the encoder to recognize and compress the information necessary for the machine recognition task. There are two main approaches in learned ICM; optimization of the compression model based on task loss, and Region of Interest (ROI) based bit allocation. These approaches provide the encoder with the recognition capability. However, optimization with task loss becomes difficult when the recognition model is deep, and ROI-based methods often involve extra overhead during evaluation. In this study, we propose a novel training method for learned ICM models that applies auxiliary loss to the encoder to improve its recognition capability and rate-distortion performance. Our method achieves Bjontegaard Delta rate improvements of 27.7% and 20.3% in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, compared to the conventional training method.

<p>Abstract: Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer is correct, but current answer correctness (AC) metrics struggle with verbose, free-form answers from large language models (LLMs). There are two challenges with current short-form QA evaluations: a lack of diverse styles of evaluation data and an over-reliance on expensive and slow LLMs. LLM-based scorers correlate better with humans, but this expensive task has only been tested on limited QA datasets. We rectify these issues by providing rubrics and datasets for evaluating machine QA adopted from the Trivia community. We also propose an efficient, and interpretable QA evaluation that is more stable than an exact match and neural methods(BERTScore).</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-ended question answering requires models to find appropriate evidence to form well-reasoned, comprehensive and helpful answers. In practical applications, models also need to engage in extended discussions on potential scenarios closely relevant to the question. With augmentation of retrieval module, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce coherent answers often with different focuses, but are still sub-optimal in terms of reliable evidence selection and in-depth question analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel Chain-of-Discussion framework to leverage the synergy among multiple open-source LLMs aiming to provide \textbf{more correct} and \textbf{more comprehensive} answers for open-ended QA, although they are not strong enough individually. Our experiments show that discussions among multiple LLMs play a vital role in enhancing the quality of answers.

<p>Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models(LLMs), it has become crucial to understand their capabilities and limitations in deciphering and explaining the complex web of causal relationships that language entails. Current methods use either explicit or implicit causal reasoning, yet there is a strong need for a unified approach combining both to tackle a wide array of causal relationships more effectively. This research proposes a novel architecture called Context Aware Reasoning Enhancement with Counterfactual Analysis(CARE CA) framework to enhance causal reasoning and explainability. The proposed framework incorporates an explicit causal detection module with ConceptNet and counterfactual statements, as well as implicit causal detection through LLMs. Our framework goes one step further with a layer of counterfactual explanations to accentuate LLMs understanding of causality. The knowledge from ConceptNet enhances the performance of multiple causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery, causal identification and counterfactual reasoning. The counterfactual sentences add explicit knowledge of the not caused by scenarios. By combining these powerful modules, our model aims to provide a deeper understanding of causal relationships, enabling enhanced interpretability. Evaluation of benchmark datasets shows improved performance across all metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. We also introduce CausalNet, a new dataset accompanied by our code, to facilitate further research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Duan, Xiaoyuan Yi, Peng Zhang, Yan Liu, Zheng Liu, Tun Lu, Xing Xie, Ning Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the role of AI, yet pose potential social risks. To steer LLMs towards human preference, alignment technologies have been introduced and gained increasing attention. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on high-quality positive-negative training pairs, suffering from noisy positive responses that are barely distinguishable from negative ones. Given recent LLMs' proficiency in generating helpful responses, this work pivots towards a new research question: can we achieve alignment using solely human-annotated negative samples, preserving helpfulness while reducing harmfulness? For this purpose, we propose Distributional Dispreference Optimization (D$^2$O), which maximizes the discrepancy between dispreferred responses and the generated non-negative ones. In this way, D$^2$O effectively eschews harmful information without incorporating noisy positive samples, while avoiding collapse using self-generated responses as anchors. We demonstrate that D$^2$O can be regarded as learning a distributional preference model reflecting human dispreference against negative responses, which is theoretically an upper bound of the instance-level DPO. Extensive experiments manifest that our method achieves comparable generation quality and surpasses the latest strong baselines in producing less harmful and more informative responses with better training stability and faster convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinfeng Wang, Sifan Song, Xinkun Wang, Yiyi Wang, Yiyi Miao, Jionglong Su, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the proposal of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), fine-tuning SAM for medical image segmentation (MIS) has become popular. However, due to the large size of the SAM model and the significant domain gap between natural and medical images, fine-tuning-based strategies are costly with potential risk of instability, feature damage and catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, some methods of transferring SAM to a domain-specific MIS through fine-tuning strategies disable the model's prompting capability, severely limiting its utilization scenarios. In this paper, we propose an Auto-Prompting Module (APM), which provides SAM-based foundation model with Euclidean adaptive prompts in the target domain. Our experiments demonstrate that such adaptive prompts significantly improve SAM's non-fine-tuned performance in MIS. In addition, we propose a novel non-invasive method called Incremental Pattern Shifting (IPS) to adapt SAM to specific medical domains. Experimental results show that the IPS enables SAM to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance in MIS without the need for fine-tuning. By coupling these two methods, we propose ProMISe, an end-to-end non-fine-tuned framework for Promptable Medical Image Segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that both using our methods individually or in combination achieves satisfactory performance in low-cost pattern shifting, with all of SAM's parameters frozen.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K.</p>

In this work, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak framework for automated red teaming of LLMs. We designed malicious content concealing and memory reframing with an iterative optimization algorithm to jailbreak LLMs, motivated by the research about the distractibility and over-confidence phenomenon of LLMs. Extensive experiments of jailbreaking both open-source and proprietary LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of effectiveness, scalability and transferability. We also evaluate the effectiveness of existing jailbreak defense methods against our attack and highlight the crucial need to develop more effective and practical defense strategies.</p>

However, existing methods for articulated objects insufficiently address noise in point clouds and struggle to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, thus limiting the practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework towards Robust Perception and Manipulation for Articulated Objects (RPMArt), which learns to estimate the articulation parameters and manipulate the articulation part from the noisy point cloud. Our primary contribution is a Robust Articulation Network (RoArtNet) that is able to predict both joint parameters and affordable points robustly by local feature learning and point tuple voting. Moreover, we introduce an articulation-aware classification scheme to enhance its ability for sim-to-real transfer. Finally, with the estimated affordable point and articulation joint constraint, the robot can generate robust actions to manipulate articulated objects. After learning only from synthetic data, RPMArt is able to transfer zero-shot to real-world articulated objects. Experimental results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving state-of-the-art performance in both noise-added simulation and real-world environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Pham, Hoang Ta, Hoa T. Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we provide data stream algorithms that compute optimal splits in decision tree learning. In particular, given a data stream of observations $x_i$ and their labels $y_i$, the goal is to find the optimal split $j$ that divides the data into two sets such that the mean squared error (for regression) or misclassification rate and Gini impurity (for classification) is minimized. We provide several fast streaming algorithms that use sublinear space and a small number of passes for these problems. These algorithms can also be extended to the massively parallel computation model. Our work, while not directly comparable, complements the seminal work of Domingos-Hulten (KDD 2000) and Hulten-Spencer-Domingos (KDD 2001).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yekyung Kim, Yapei Chang, Marzena Karpinska, Aparna Garimella, Varun Manjunatha, Kyle Lo, Tanya Goyal, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: While long-context large language models (LLMs) can technically summarize book-length documents (>100K tokens), the length and complexity of the documents have so far prohibited evaluations of input-dependent aspects like faithfulness. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. We collect FABLES, a dataset of annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on faithfulness: Claude-3-Opus significantly outperforms all closed-source LLMs, while the open-source Mixtral is on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. An analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events occurring towards the end of the book.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixi Wang, Zeyi Liu, Nicolas Ouporov, Shuran Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot-to-human object handover is an important step in many human robot collaboration tasks. A successful handover requires the robot to maintain a stable grasp on the object while making sure the human receives the object in a natural and easy-to-use manner. We propose ContactHandover, a robot to human handover system that consists of two phases: a contact-guided grasping phase and an object delivery phase. During the grasping phase, ContactHandover predicts both 6-DoF robot grasp poses and a 3D affordance map of human contact points on the object. The robot grasp poses are re-ranked by penalizing those that block human contact points, and the robot executes the highest ranking grasp. During the delivery phase, the robot end effector pose is computed by maximizing human contact points close to the human while minimizing the human arm joint torques and displacements. We evaluate our system on 27 diverse household objects and show that our system achieves better visibility and reachability of human contacts to the receiver compared to several baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanpeng Ye, Jie Ren, Shaozhou Wang, Yuwei Wan, Haofen Wang, Imran Razzak, Bram Hoex, Tong Xie, Wenjie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive scientific literature, posing significant challenges for efficient discovery and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques, integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianlong Zeng, Yijing Gao, Fanghao Song, Ang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a simple yet effective method for identifying similar data points across non-free text domains, such as tabular and image data, using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our two-step approach involves data point summarization and hidden state extraction. Initially, data is condensed via summarization using an LLM, reducing complexity and highlighting essential information in sentences. Subsequently, the summarization sentences are fed through another LLM to extract hidden states, serving as compact, feature-rich representations. This approach leverages the advanced comprehension and generative capabilities of LLMs, offering a scalable and efficient strategy for similarity identification across diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying similar data points on multiple datasets. Additionally, our approach enables non-technical domain experts, such as fraud investigators or marketing operators, to quickly identify similar data points tailored to specific scenarios, demonstrating its utility in practical applications. In general, our results open new avenues for leveraging LLMs in data analysis across various domains</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiao Ou, Jiayu Wu, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations requires high-quality instructional dialogues, which usually require instructions that are diverse and in-depth. Existing methods leverage two LLMs to interact for automatic collection: one simulating a user to pose instructions, and the other acting as a system agent to respond. However, these user simulators struggle to model the rules behind how dialogues can pose different instructions without explicit guidance, resulting in general instructions. In this paper, we propose to explicitly capture the complex rules to help the user simulator pose diverse and in-depth instruction. Specifically, we first induce high-level instruction strategies from various real instruction dialogues serving as rules. Afterward, different possible strategies are applied to the newly given dialogue scenario deductively to pose various instructions. Experimental results show that our method can generate diverse and in-depth instructions. The constructed multi-turn instructional dialogues can outperform competitive baselines on the downstream chat model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Wang, Yifan Sun, Zhentao Tan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores in-context learning for image copy detection (ICD), i.e., prompting an ICD model to identify replicated images with new tampering patterns without the need for additional training. The prompts (or the contexts) are from a small set of image-replica pairs that reflect the new patterns and are used at inference time. Such in-context ICD has good realistic value, because it requires no fine-tuning and thus facilitates fast reaction against the emergence of unseen patterns. To accommodate the "seen $\rightarrow$ unseen" generalization scenario, we construct the first large-scale pattern dataset named AnyPattern, which has the largest number of tamper patterns ($90$ for training and $10$ for testing) among all the existing ones. We benchmark AnyPattern with popular ICD methods and reveal that existing methods barely generalize to novel patterns. We further propose a simple in-context ICD method named ImageStacker. ImageStacker learns to select the most representative image-replica pairs and employs them as the pattern prompts in a stacking manner (rather than the popular concatenation manner). Experimental results show (1) training with our large-scale dataset substantially benefits pattern generalization ($+26.66 \%$ $\mu AP$), (2) the proposed ImageStacker facilitates effective in-context ICD (another round of $+16.75 \%$ $\mu AP$), and (3) AnyPattern enables in-context ICD, i.e., without such a large-scale dataset, in-context learning does not emerge even with our ImageStacker. Beyond the ICD task, we also demonstrate how AnyPattern can benefit artists, i.e., the pattern retrieval method trained on AnyPattern can be generalized to identify style mimicry by text-to-image models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huihong Shi, Haikuo Shao, Wendong Mao, Zhongfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the huge success of Transformers in the field of natural language processing (NLP), Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been rapidly developed and achieved remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, their huge model sizes and intensive computations hinder ViTs' deployment on embedded devices, calling for effective model compression methods, such as quantization. Unfortunately, due to the existence of hardware-unfriendly and quantization-sensitive non-linear operations, particularly {Softmax}, it is non-trivial to completely quantize all operations in ViTs, yielding either significant accuracy drops or non-negligible hardware costs. In response to challenges associated with \textit{standard ViTs}, we focus our attention towards the quantization and acceleration for \textit{efficient ViTs}, which not only eliminate the troublesome Softmax but also integrate linear attention with low computational complexity, and propose Trio-ViT accordingly. Specifically, at the algorithm level, we develop a {tailored post-training quantization engine} taking the unique activation distributions of Softmax-free efficient ViTs into full consideration, aiming to boost quantization accuracy. Furthermore, at the hardware level, we build an accelerator dedicated to the specific Convolution-Transformer hybrid architecture of efficient ViTs, thereby enhancing hardware efficiency. Extensive experimental results consistently prove the effectiveness of our Trio-ViT framework. {Particularly, we can gain up to $\uparrow$$\mathbf{3.6}\times$, $\uparrow$$\mathbf{5.0}\times$, and $\uparrow$$\mathbf{7.3}\times$ FPS under comparable accuracy over state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, as well as $\uparrow$$\mathbf{6.0}\times$, $\uparrow$$\mathbf{1.5}\times$, and $\uparrow$$\mathbf{2.1}\times$ DSP efficiency.} Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/shihuihong214/Trio-ViT}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengjie Wang, Chengming Liu, Lei Shi, Pang Haibo</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods often struggle to handle the extensive diversity in training sets, particularly when they contain stylistically diverse and feature-rich samples, which we categorize as feature-rich anomaly detection datasets (FRADs). This challenge is evident in applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a lightweight autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs. In our methodology, any dataset can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly detection, in a way that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple challenging benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anish Bhattacharya, Nishanth Rao, Dhruv Parikh, Pratik Kunapuli, Yuwei Wu, Yuezhan Tao, Nikolai Matni, Vijay Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of an attention-based end-to-end approach for high-speed vision-based quadrotor obstacle avoidance in dense, cluttered environments, with comparison to various state-of-the-art learning architectures. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional model-based approaches to navigation via independent perception, mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to have great potential for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all tested flight speeds. We assess performance at speeds of up to 7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12001">Scrutinize What We Ignore: Reining In Task Representation Shift Of Context-Based Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Zhang, Boyuan Zheng, Tianying Ji, Jinhang Liu, Anqi Guo, Junqiao Zhao, Lanqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising approach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by leveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous context-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating optimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance improvements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of maximizing the mutual information between the task and the task representation ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task representation. Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of performance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored. Inspired by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the previous optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of maximizing the expected return, thereby providing a feasible explanation concerning performance improvements. Furthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we find it ignores the impacts stemming from the variation of the task representation in the alternating optimization process, which may lead to performance improvement collapse. We name this issue \underline{task representation shift} and theoretically prove that the monotonic performance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder updates. We set different manners to rein in the task representation shift on three widely adopted training objectives concerning maximizing $I(Z;M)$ across different data qualities. Empirical results show that reining in the task representation shift can indeed improve performance. Our work opens up a new avenue for OMRL, leading to a better understanding between the performance and the task representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunnosuke Ikeda, Naoki Nishimura, Shunji Umetani</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the interpretable estimation of price bounds in the context of price optimization. In recent years, price-optimization methods have become indispensable for maximizing revenue and profits. However, effective application of these methods to real-world pricing operations remains a significant challenge. It is crucial for operators responsible for setting prices to utilize reasonable price bounds that are not only interpretable but also acceptable. Despite this necessity, most studies assume that price bounds are given constant values, and few have explored reasonable determinations of these bounds. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework for determining price bounds that includes both the estimation and adjustment of these bounds. Specifically, we first estimate price bounds using three distinct approaches based on historical pricing data. Then, we adjust the estimated price bounds by solving an optimization problem that incorporates shape constraints. This method allows the implementation of price optimization under practical and reasonable price bounds suitable for real-world applications. We report the effectiveness of our proposed method through numerical experiments using historical pricing data from actual services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a significant improvement on the previous conference paper known as DefSent. The prior study seeks to improve sentence embeddings of language models by projecting definition sentences into the vector space of dictionary entries. We discover that this approach is not fully explored due to the methodological limitation of using word embeddings of language models to represent dictionary entries. This leads to two hindrances. First, dictionary entries are constrained by the single-word vocabulary, and thus cannot be fully exploited. Second, semantic representations of language models are known to be anisotropic, but pre-processing word embeddings for DefSent is not allowed because its weight is frozen during training and tied to the prediction layer. In this paper, we propose a novel method to progressively build entry embeddings not subject to the limitations. As a result, definition sentences can be projected into a quasi-isotropic or isotropic vector space of unlimited dictionary entries, so that sentence embeddings of noticeably better quality are attainable. We abbreviate our approach as DefSent+ (a plus version of DefSent), involving the following strengths: 1) the task performance on measuring sentence similarities is significantly improved compared to DefSent; 2) when DefSent+ is used to further train data-augmented models like SIMCSE, SNCSE, and SynCSE, state-of-the-art performance on measuring sentence similarities can be achieved among the approaches without using manually labeled datasets; 3) DefSent+ is also competitive in feature-based transfer for NLP downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a rising interest and trend in research towards directly translating speech from one language to another, known as end-to-end speech-to-speech translation. However, most end-to-end models struggle to outperform cascade models, i.e., a pipeline framework by concatenating speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech models. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexities involved in direct translation tasks and the scarcity of data. In this study, we introduce a novel model framework TransVIP that leverages diverse datasets in a cascade fashion yet facilitates end-to-end inference through joint probability. Furthermore, we propose two separated encoders to preserve the speaker's voice characteristics and isochrony from the source speech during the translation process, making it highly suitable for scenarios such as video dubbing. Our experiments on the French-English language pair demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Po\v{s}tuvan, Claas Grohnfeldt, Michele Russo, Giulio Lovisotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in continuous-time dynamic graphs is an emerging field yet under-explored in the context of learning algorithms. In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying categorically anomalous graph links. First, we introduce a fine-grained taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. Based on these properties, we introduce a method for generating and injecting typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs featuring consistencies across either or combinations of time, structure, and context. To enable temporal graph learning methods to detect specific types of anomalous links rather than the bare existence of a link, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Comprehensive benchmarks on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art link prediction methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting methods for anomaly detection. Our results reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies. We conclude with a comprehensive list of findings highlighting opportunities for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelica Chen, Sadhika Malladi, Lily H. Zhang, Xinyi Chen, Qiuyi Zhang, Rajesh Ranganath, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited. In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets. We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint. Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: For reliable autonomous robot navigation in urban settings, the robot must have the ability to identify semantically traversable terrains in the image based on the semantic understanding of the scene. This reasoning ability is based on semantic traversability, which is frequently achieved using semantic segmentation models fine-tuned on the testing domain. This fine-tuning process often involves manual data collection with the target robot and annotation by human labelers which is prohibitively expensive and unscalable. In this work, we present an effective methodology for training a semantic traversability estimator using egocentric videos and an automated annotation process. Egocentric videos are collected from a camera mounted on a pedestrian's chest. The dataset for training the semantic traversability estimator is then automatically generated by extracting semantically traversable regions in each video frame using a recent foundation model in image segmentation and its prompting technique. Extensive experiments with videos taken across several countries and cities, covering diverse urban scenarios, demonstrate the high scalability and generalizability of the proposed annotation method. Furthermore, performance analysis and real-world deployment for autonomous robot navigation showcase that the trained semantic traversability estimator is highly accurate, able to handle diverse camera viewpoints, computationally light, and real-world applicable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianben He, Xingbo Wang, Shiyi Liu, Guande Wu, Claudio Silva, Huamin Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive abilities for multimodal content comprehension and reasoning with proper prompting in zero- or few-shot settings. Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Shi, Chiyu Ma, Wenhua Liang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge presents a promising alternative to human evaluators across various tasks, but inherent biases, especially position bias - a tendency to favor solutions based on their position in the prompt - have compromised its effectiveness. Our study introduces a systematic framework to examine position bias in pairwise comparisons, focusing on repetition stability, position consistency, and preference fairness. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluations. We conducted experiments with 12 LLM judges across MTBench and DevBench, covering 22 tasks and approximately 40 solution-generating models - candidates, resulting in over 100,000 evaluation instances. Our findings confirm that position bias in capable LLM judges is not due to random chances, along with notable variations observed across judges and tasks. Moreover, position bias is weakly influenced by the length of prompt components but significantly impacted by the quality gap between solutions. These insights can help optimize judge model selections, improve benchmark design, and inform future research on debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM judges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deri Siswara, Agus M. Soleh, Aji Hamim Wigena</p>
<p>Abstract: This research aims to evaluate the performance of several Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures including Simple RNN, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), compared to classic algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost in building classification models for early crash detection in ASEAN-5 stock markets. The study is examined using imbalanced data, which is common due to the rarity of market crashes. The study analyzes daily data from 2010 to 2023 across the major stock markets of the ASEAN-5 countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Philippines. Market crash is identified as the target variable when the major stock price indices fall below the Value at Risk (VaR) thresholds of 5%, 2.5% and 1%. predictors involving technical indicators of major local and global markets as well as commodity markets. This study includes 213 predictors with their respective lags (5, 10, 15, 22, 50, 200) and uses a time step of 7, expanding the total number of predictors to 1491. The challenge of data imbalance is addressed with SMOTE-ENN. The results show that all RNN-Based architectures outperform Random Forest and XGBoost. Among the various RNN architectures, Simple RNN stands out as the most superior, mainly due to the data characteristics that are not overly complex and focus more on short-term information. This study enhances and extends the range of phenomena observed in previous studies by incorporating variables like different geographical zones and time periods, as well as methodological adjustments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanli Yang, Fei Sun, Jiajun Tan, Xinyu Ma, Du Su, Dawei Yin, Huawei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in model editing methods, their application in real-world scenarios remains challenging as they often cause large language models (LLMs) to collapse. Among them, ROME is particularly concerning, as it could disrupt LLMs with only a single edit. In this paper, we study the root causes of such collapse. Through extensive analysis, we identify two primary factors that contribute to the collapse: i) inconsistent handling of prefixed and unprefixed keys in the parameter update equation may result in very small denominators, causing excessively large parameter updates; ii) the subject of collapse cases is usually the first token, whose unprefixed key distribution significantly differs from the prefixed key distribution in autoregressive transformers, causing the aforementioned issue to materialize. To validate our findings, we propose a simple yet effective approach: uniformly using prefixed keys during editing phase and adding prefixes during testing phase to ensure the consistency between training and testing. The experimental results show that the proposed solution can prevent model collapse while maintaining the effectiveness of the edits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Moore, Jesse Roberts, Thao Pham, Oseremhen Ewaleifoh, Doug Fisher</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloze testing is a common method for measuring the behavior of large language models on a number of benchmark tasks. Using the MMLU dataset, we show that the base-rate probability (BRP) differences across answer tokens are significant and affect task performance ie. guess A if uncertain. We find that counterfactual prompting does sufficiently mitigate the BRP effect. The BRP effect is found to have a similar effect to test taking strategies employed by humans leading to the conflation of task performance and test-taking ability. We propose the Nvr-X-MMLU task, a variation of MMLU, which helps to disambiguate test-taking ability from task performance and reports the latter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Haizhou Shi, Ligong Han, Dimitris Metaxas, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Insects represent half of all global biodiversity, yet many of the world's insects are disappearing, with severe implications for ecosystems and agriculture. Despite this crisis, data on insect diversity and abundance remain woefully inadequate, due to the scarcity of human experts and the lack of scalable tools for monitoring. Ecologists have started to adopt camera traps to record and study insects, and have proposed computer vision algorithms as an answer for scalable data processing. However, insect monitoring in the wild poses unique challenges that have not yet been addressed within computer vision, including the combination of long-tailed data, extremely similar classes, and significant distribution shifts. We provide the first large-scale machine learning benchmarks for fine-grained insect recognition, designed to match real-world tasks faced by ecologists. Our contributions include a curated dataset of images from citizen science platforms and museums, and an expert-annotated dataset drawn from automated camera traps across multiple continents, designed to test out-of-distribution generalization under field conditions. We train and evaluate a variety of baseline algorithms and introduce a combination of data augmentation techniques that enhance generalization across geographies and hardware setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao-Ching Yu, Chun-Chih Kuo, Ziqi Ye, Yu-Cheng Chang, Yueh-Se Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensembling multiple models has always been an effective approach to push the limits of existing performance and is widely used in classification tasks by simply averaging the classification probability vectors from multiple classifiers to achieve better accuracy. However, in the thriving open-source Large Language Model (LLM) community, ensembling methods are rare and typically limited to ensembling the full-text outputs of LLMs, such as selecting the best output using a ranker, which leads to underutilization of token-level probability information. In this paper, we treat the Generation of each token by LLMs as a Classification (GaC) for ensembling. This approach fully exploits the probability information at each generation step and better prevents LLMs from producing early incorrect tokens that lead to snowballing errors. In experiments, we ensemble state-of-the-art LLMs on several benchmarks, including exams, mathematics and reasoning, and observe that our method breaks the existing community performance ceiling. Furthermore, we observed that most of the tokens in the answer are simple and do not affect the correctness of the final answer. Therefore, we also experimented with ensembling only key tokens, and the results showed better performance with lower latency across benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Sarch, Lawrence Jang, Michael J. Tarr, William W. Cohen, Kenneth Marino, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Wang, Zekun Wu, Xin Guan, Michael Thaler, Adriano Koshiyama, Skylar Lu, Sachin Beepath, Ediz Ertekin Jr., Maria Perez-Ortiz</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hiring has led to legislative actions to protect vulnerable demographic groups. This paper presents a novel framework for benchmarking hierarchical gender hiring bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) for resume scoring, revealing significant issues of reverse gender hiring bias and overdebiasing. Our contributions are fourfold: Firstly, we introduce a new construct grounded in labour economics, legal principles, and critiques of current bias benchmarks: hiring bias can be categorized into two types: Level bias (difference in the average outcomes between demographic counterfactual groups) and Spread bias (difference in the variance of outcomes between demographic counterfactual groups); Level bias can be further subdivided into statistical bias (i.e. changing with non-demographic content) and taste-based bias (i.e. consistent regardless of non-demographic content). Secondly, the framework includes rigorous statistical and computational hiring bias metrics, such as Rank After Scoring (RAS), Rank-based Impact Ratio, Permutation Test, and Fixed Effects Model. Thirdly, we analyze gender hiring biases in ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Seven out of ten LLMs show significant biases against males in at least one industry. An industry-effect regression reveals that the healthcare industry is the most biased against males. Moreover, we found that the bias performance remains invariant with resume content for eight out of ten LLMs. This indicates that the bias performance measured in this paper might apply to other resume datasets with different resume qualities. Fourthly, we provide a user-friendly demo and resume dataset to support the adoption and practical use of the framework, which can be generalized to other social traits and tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Customized image generation, which seeks to synthesize images with consistent characters, holds significant relevance for applications such as storytelling, portrait generation, and character design. However, previous approaches have encountered challenges in preserving characters with high-fidelity consistency due to inadequate feature extraction and concept confusion of reference characters. Therefore, we propose Character-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework designed to generate images that preserve the details of reference characters, ensuring high-fidelity consistency. Character-Adapter employs prompt-guided segmentation to ensure fine-grained regional features of reference characters and dynamic region-level adapters to mitigate concept confusion. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of Character-Adapter. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that Character-Adapter achieves the state-of-the-art performance of consistent character generation, with an improvement of 24.8% compared with other methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiancheng Xu, Yongqi Li, Heming Xia, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool learning aims to enhance and expand large language models' (LLMs) capabilities with external tools, which has gained significant attention recently. Current methods have shown that LLMs can effectively handle a certain amount of tools through in-context learning or fine-tuning. However, in real-world scenarios, the number of tools is typically extensive and irregularly updated, emphasizing the necessity for a dedicated tool retrieval component. Tool retrieval is nontrivial due to the following challenges: 1) complex user instructions and tool descriptions; 2) misalignment between tool retrieval and tool usage models. To address the above issues, we propose to enhance tool retrieval with iterative feedback from the large language model. Specifically, we prompt the tool usage model, i.e., the LLM, to provide feedback for the tool retriever model in multi-round, which could progressively improve the tool retriever's understanding of instructions and tools and reduce the gap between the two standalone components. We build a unified and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate tool retrieval models. The extensive experiments indicate that our proposed approach achieves advanced performance in both in-domain evaluation and out-of-domain evaluation.</p>

We introduce an extensible CDCM with a Semi-active Mechanism (SAM) and develop a real-time hysteresis compensation control algorithm using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) based on data collected from fiducial markers and RGBD sensing. Performance validation shows the proposed controller significantly reduces hysteresis by up to 69.5% in random trajectory tracking test and approximately 26% in the box pointing task. The SAM mechanism enables access to various lesions without damaging surrounding tissues. The proposed controller with TCN-based compensation effectively predicts hysteresis behavior and minimizes position and joint angle errors in real-time, which has the potential to enhance surgical task performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.</p>

We propose a domain-agnostic framework for systematically evaluating distribution shifts in LLMs decision-making processes, where they are given control of mechanisms governed by pre-defined rules. While individual LLM actions may appear consistent with expected behavior, across a large number of trials, statistically significant distribution shifts can emerge. To test this, we construct a well-defined environment with known outcome logic: blackjack. In more than 1,000 trials, we uncover statistically significant evidence suggesting behavioral misalignment in the learned representations of LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serene Lim, Mar\'ia P\'erez-Ortiz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the subtle and often concealed biases present in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on implicit biases that may remain despite passing explicit bias tests. Implicit biases are significant because they influence the decisions made by these systems, potentially perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination, even when LLMs appear to function fairly. Traditionally, explicit bias tests or embedding-based methods are employed to detect bias, but these approaches can overlook more nuanced, implicit forms of bias. To address this, we introduce two novel psychological-inspired methodologies: the LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and the LLM Decision Bias, designed to reveal and measure implicit biases through prompt-based and decision-making tasks. Additionally, open-ended generation tasks with thematic analysis of word generations and storytelling provide qualitative insights into the model's behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM IAT Bias correlates with traditional methods and more effectively predicts downstream behaviors, as measured by the LLM Decision Bias, offering a more comprehensive framework for detecting subtle biases in AI systems. This research advances the field of AI ethics by proposing new methods to continually assess and mitigate biases in LLMs, highlighting the importance of qualitative and decision-focused evaluations to address challenges that previous approaches have not fully captured.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhuo, Guang Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of CGNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by the question, "Can we generate tumors with desired attributes?'' this study leverages radiomics features to explore the feasibility of generating synthetic tumor images. Characterized by its low-dimensional yet biologically meaningful markers, radiomics bridges the gap between complex medical imaging data and actionable clinical insights. We present RadiomicsFill-Mammo, the first of the RadiomicsFill series, an innovative technique that generates realistic mammogram mass images mirroring specific radiomics attributes using masked images and opposite breast images, leveraging a recent stable diffusion model. This approach also allows for the incorporation of essential clinical variables, such as BI-RADS and breast density, alongside radiomics features as conditions for mass generation. Results indicate that RadiomicsFill-Mammo effectively generates diverse and realistic tumor images based on various radiomics conditions. Results also demonstrate a significant improvement in mass detection capabilities, leveraging RadiomicsFill-Mammo as a strategy to generate simulated samples. Furthermore, RadiomicsFill-Mammo not only advances medical imaging research but also opens new avenues for enhancing treatment planning and tumor simulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Roberts, Kyle Moore, Thao Pham, Oseremhen Ewaleifoh, Doug Fisher</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive fan effects, similar to those discovered by Anderson in humans, after being pre-trained on human textual data. We conduct two sets of in-context recall experiments designed to elicit fan effects. Consistent with human results, we find that LLM recall uncertainty, measured via token probability, is influenced by the fan effect. Our results show that removing uncertainty disrupts the observed effect. The experiments suggest the fan effect is consistent whether the fan value is induced in-context or in the pre-training data. Finally, these findings provide in-silico evidence that fan effects and typicality are expressions of the same phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Tonks, Cuong Nguyen, Steve Hood, Ryan Musso, Ceridwen Hopely, Steve Titus, Minh Doan, Iain Styles, Alexander Krull</p>
<p>Abstract: The large volume and variety of imaging data from high-throughput screening (HTS) in the pharmaceutical industry present an excellent resource for training virtual staining models. However, the potential of models trained under one set of experimental conditions to generalize to other conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates whether data from three cell types (lung, ovarian, and breast) and two phenotypes (toxic and non-toxic conditions) commonly found in HTS can effectively train virtual staining models to generalize across three typical HTS distribution shifts: unseen phenotypes, unseen cell types, and the combination of both. Utilizing a dataset of 772,416 paired bright-field, cytoplasm, nuclei, and DNA-damage stain images, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across pixel-based, instance-wise, and biological-feature-based levels. Our findings indicate that training virtual nuclei and cytoplasm models on non-toxic condition samples not only generalizes to toxic condition samples but leads to improved performance across all evaluation levels compared to training on toxic condition samples. Generalization to unseen cell types shows variability depending on the cell type; models trained on ovarian or lung cell samples often perform well under other conditions, while those trained on breast cell samples consistently show poor generalization. Generalization to unseen cell types and phenotypes shows good generalization across all levels of evaluation compared to addressing unseen cell types alone. This study represents the first large-scale, data-centric analysis of the generalization capability of virtual staining models trained on diverse HTS datasets, providing valuable strategies for experimental training data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) constitute a significant role in exploring machine intelligence and advanced applications. In order to deeply investigate complicated interactions within MAS scenarios, we originally propose "GNN for MBRL" model, which utilizes a state-spaced Graph Neural Networks with Model-based Reinforcement Learning to address specific MAS missions (e.g., Billiard-Avoidance, Autonomous Driving Cars). In detail, we firstly used GNN model to predict future states and trajectories of multiple agents, then applied the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) optimized Model Predictive Control to assist the ego-agent planning actions and successfully accomplish certain MAS tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivia Y. Lee, Annie Xie, Kuan Fang, Karl Pertsch, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots equipped with reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to learn a wide range of skills solely from a reward signal. However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive reasoning about affordances through keypoints in zero-shot, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 20K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 35K online fine-tuning steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungjun Yoon, Biniyam Aschalew Tolera, Taesik Gong, Kimin Lee, Sung-Ju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities across various domains. However, utilizing LLMs for ubiquitous sensing applications remains challenging as existing text-prompt methods show significant performance degradation when handling long sensor data sequences. We propose a visual prompting approach for sensor data using multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We design a visual prompt that directs MLLMs to utilize visualized sensor data alongside the target sensory task descriptions. Additionally, we introduce a visualization generator that automates the creation of optimal visualizations tailored to a given sensory task, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. We evaluated our approach on nine sensory tasks involving four sensing modalities, achieving an average of 10% higher accuracy than text-based prompts and reducing token costs by 15.8 times. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of visual prompts with MLLMs for various sensory tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/diamond264/ByMyEyes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoforus Yoga Haryanto</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LLAssist, an open-source tool designed to streamline literature reviews in academic research. In an era of exponential growth in scientific publications, researchers face mounting challenges in efficiently processing vast volumes of literature. LLAssist addresses this issue by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate key aspects of the review process. Specifically, it extracts important information from research articles and evaluates their relevance to user-defined research questions. The goal of LLAssist is to significantly reduce the time and effort required for comprehensive literature reviews, allowing researchers to focus more on analyzing and synthesizing information rather than on initial screening tasks. By automating parts of the literature review workflow, LLAssist aims to help researchers manage the growing volume of academic publications more efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yu, Peng Gao, Fei Wang, Ru-Yue Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the increasing complexity of chip design, existing placement methods still have many shortcomings in dealing with macro cells coverage and optimization efficiency. Aiming at the problems of layout overlap, inferior performance, and low optimization efficiency in existing chip design methods, this paper proposes an end-to-end placement method, SRLPlacer, based on reinforcement learning. First, the placement problem is transformed into a Markov decision process by establishing the coupling relationship graph model between macro cells to learn the strategy for optimizing layouts. Secondly, the whole placement process is optimized after integrating the standard cell layout. By assessing on the public benchmark ISPD2005, the proposed SRLPlacer can effectively solve the overlap problem between macro cells while considering routing congestion and shortening the total wire length to ensure routability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Zhou, Joseph Severino, Sanjana Vijayshankar, Juliette Ugirumurera, Jibo Sanyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economical and equity considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering equitable and real-time load shedding decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted the creation of numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities.This study focuses on the Comprehensive Medical Benchmark in Chinese (CMB), showcasing how dataset diversity and distribution in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may enhance LLM performance.Remarkably, We successfully trained a smaller base model to achieve scores comparable to larger models, indicating that a diverse and well-distributed dataset can optimize performance regardless of model size.This study suggests that even smaller models may reach high performance levels with carefully curated and varied datasets. By integrating a wide range of instructional content, our approach addresses potential issues such as data quality inconsistencies. Our results imply that a broader spectrum of training data may enhance a model's ability to generalize and perform effectively across different medical scenarios, highlighting the importance of dataset quality and diversity in fine-tuning processes.

Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined random walk with unifying memory (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node. Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test. On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Ding, Shaobin Zhuang, Kunchang Li, Zhengrong Yue, Yu Qiao, Yali Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world. Our codes and models will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonyo Musabini, Ivan Novikov, Sana Soula, Christel Leonet, Lihao Wang, Rachid Benmokhtar, Fabian Burger, Thomas Boulay, Xavier Perrotton</p>
<p>Abstract: Current parking area perception algorithms primarily focus on detecting vacant slots within a limited range, relying on error-prone homographic projection for both labeling and inference. However, recent advancements in Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) require interaction with end-users through comprehensive and intelligent Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs). These interfaces should present a complete perception of the parking area going from distinguishing vacant slots' entry lines to the orientation of other parked vehicles. This paper introduces Multi-Task Fisheye Cross View Transformers (MT F-CVT), which leverages features from a four-camera fisheye Surround-view Camera System (SVCS) with multihead attentions to create a detailed Bird-Eye View (BEV) grid feature map. Features are processed by both a segmentation decoder and a Polygon-Yolo based object detection decoder for parking slots and vehicles. Trained on data labeled using LiDAR, MT F-CVT positions objects within a 25m x 25m real open-road scenes with an average error of only 20 cm. Our larger model achieves an F-1 score of 0.89. Moreover the smaller model operates at 16 fps on an Nvidia Jetson Orin embedded board, with similar detection results to the larger one. MT F-CVT demonstrates robust generalization capability across different vehicles and camera rig configurations.

<p>Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation (https://github.com/WillHua127/ReactZyme).</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore how to enhance next-token prediction models to perform in-context imitation learning on a real robot, where the robot executes new tasks by interpreting contextual information provided during the input phase, without updating its underlying policy parameters. We propose In-Context Robot Transformer (ICRT), a causal transformer that performs autoregressive prediction on sensorimotor trajectories without relying on any linguistic data or reward function. This formulation enables flexible and training-free execution of new tasks at test time, achieved by prompting the model with sensorimotor trajectories of the new task composing of image observations, actions and states tuples, collected through human teleoperation. Experiments with a Franka Emika robot demonstrate that the ICRT can adapt to new tasks specified by prompts, even in environment configurations that differ from both the prompt and the training data. In a multitask environment setup, ICRT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art next-token prediction models in robotics on generalizing to unseen tasks.

<p>Abstract: Language models are exhibiting increasing capability in knowledge utilization and reasoning. However, when applied as agents in embodied environments, they often suffer from misalignment between their intrinsic knowledge and environmental knowledge, leading to infeasible actions. Traditional environment alignment methods, such as supervised learning on expert trajectories and reinforcement learning, encounter limitations in covering environmental knowledge and achieving efficient convergence, respectively. Inspired by human learning, we propose Exploration-based Error Correction Learning (E2CL), a novel framework that leverages exploration-induced errors and environmental feedback to enhance environment alignment for embodied agents. E2CL incorporates teacher-guided and teacher-free explorations to gather environmental feedback and correct erroneous actions. The agent learns to provide feedback and self-correct, thereby enhancing its adaptability to target environments. Extensive experiments in the VirtualHome environment demonstrate that E2CL-trained agents outperform those trained by baseline methods and exhibit superior self-correction capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yi Leong, Yi Fan Gao, Ji Shuai, Yang Zhang, Uktu Pamuksuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports. These findings suggest that MediGen has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative workload on physicians, improving both healthcare efficiency and physician well-being.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Wang, Shang Zhao, Zikang Xu, S Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation is instrumental to minimally invasive surgeries and related applications. Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sim2Real transfer, particularly for manipulation policies relying on RGB images, remains a critical challenge in robotics due to the significant domain shift between synthetic and real-world visual data. In this paper, we propose SplatSim, a novel framework that leverages Gaussian Splatting as the primary rendering primitive to reduce the Sim2Real gap for RGB-based manipulation policies. By replacing traditional mesh representations with Gaussian Splats in simulators, SplatSim produces highly photorealistic synthetic data while maintaining the scalability and cost-efficiency of simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by training manipulation policies within SplatSim and deploying them in the real world in a zero-shot manner, achieving an average success rate of 86.25%, compared to 97.5% for policies trained on real-world data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengchao Liu, Divin Yan, Weitao Du, Weiyang Liu, Zhuoxinran Li, Hongyu Guo, Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown great potential in structure-based drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing separation violations and improving binding affinities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingjie Song, Wenjun Wang, Shunian Chen, Xidong Wang, Michael Guan, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to remarkable performances across various domains. However, this progress is accompanied by a substantial surge in the resource consumption of these models. We address this pressing issue by introducing a new approach, Token Reduction using CLIP Metric (TRIM), aimed at improving the efficiency of MLLMs without sacrificing their performance. Inspired by human attention patterns in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, TRIM presents a fresh perspective on the selection and reduction of image tokens. The TRIM method has been extensively tested across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining a consistent level of performance. This research marks a critical stride in efficient MLLM development, promoting greater accessibility and sustainability of high-performing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faiza Bouamra, Mohamed Sayah, Labib Sadek Terrissa, Noureddine Zerhouni</p>
<p>Abstract: In material physics, characterization techniques are foremost crucial for obtaining the materials data regarding the physical properties as well as structural, electronics, magnetic, optic, dielectric, and spectroscopic characteristics. However, for many materials, ensuring availability and safe accessibility is not always easy and fully warranted. Moreover, the use of modeling and simulation techniques need a lot of theoretical knowledge, in addition of being associated to costly computation time and a great complexity deal. Thus, analyzing materials with different techniques for multiple samples simultaneously, still be very challenging for engineers and researchers. It is worth noting that although of being very risky, X-ray diffraction is the well known and widely used characterization technique which gathers data from structural properties of crystalline 1d, 2d or 3d materials. We propose in this paper, a Smart GRU for Gated Recurrent Unit model to forcast structural characteristics or properties of thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110). Indeed, thin films samples are elaborated and managed experimentally and the collected data dictionary is then used to generate an AI -- Artificial Intelligence -- GRU model for the thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110) structural property characterization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsun Lim, Hojun Choi, Pin-Yu Chen, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyana Figuera, Soogeun Park, Hyemin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose $\text{MR.HuBo}$ (Motion Retargeting leveraging a HUman BOdy prior), a cost-effective and convenient method to collect high-quality upper body paired $\langle \text{robot, human} \rangle$ pose data, which is essential for data-driven motion retargeting methods. Unlike existing approaches which collect $\langle \text{robot, human} \rangle$ pose data by converting human MoCap poses into robot poses, our method goes in reverse. We first sample diverse random robot poses, and then convert them into human poses. However, since random robot poses can result in extreme and infeasible human poses, we propose an additional technique to sort out extreme poses by exploiting a human body prior trained from a large amount of human pose data. Our data collection method can be used for any humanoid robots, if one designs or optimizes the system's hyperparameters which include a size scale factor and the joint angle ranges for sampling. In addition to this data collection method, we also present a two-stage motion retargeting neural network that can be trained via supervised learning on a large amount of paired data. Compared to other learning-based methods trained via unsupervised learning, we found that our deep neural network trained with ample high-quality paired data achieved notable performance. Our experiments also show that our data filtering method yields better retargeting results than training the model with raw and noisy data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Kessel, Colin Atkinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) holds great potential to improve software engineering productivity, but its untrustworthy outputs, particularly in code synthesis, pose significant challenges. The need for extensive verification and validation (V&V) of GAI-generated artifacts may undermine the potential productivity gains. This paper proposes a way of mitigating these risks by exploiting GAI's ability to generate multiple versions of code and tests to facilitate comparative analysis across versions. Rather than relying on the quality of a single test or code module, this "differential GAI" (D-GAI) approach promotes more reliable quality evaluation through version diversity. We introduce the Large-Scale Software Observatorium (LASSO), a platform that supports D-GAI by executing and analyzing large sets of code versions and tests. We discuss how LASSO enables rigorous evaluation of GAI-generated artifacts and propose its application in both software development and GAI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Chiu So, Siu Pang Yung</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingkun Yao, Ning Wang, Jie Zhou, Xi Wang, Hong Gao, Zhe Jiang, Nan Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Bug localization in Verilog code is a crucial and time-consuming task during the verification of hardware design. Since introduction, Large Language Models (LLMs) have showed their strong programming capabilities. However, no work has yet considered using LLMs for bug localization in Verilog code. This paper presents Location-is-Key, an opensource LLM solution to locate functional errors in Verilog snippets. LiK achieves high localization accuracy, with a pass@1 localization accuracy of 93.3% on our test dataset based on RTLLM, surpassing GPT-4's 77.9% and comparable to Claude-3.5's 90.8%. Additionally, the bug location obtained by LiK significantly improves GPT-3.5's bug repair efficiency (Functional pass@1 increased from 40.39% to 58.92%), highlighting the importance of bug localization in LLM-based Verilog debugging. Compared to existing methods, LiK only requires the design specification and the erroneous code snippet, without the need for testbenches, assertions, or any other EDA tools. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs for Verilog error localization, thus providing a new direction for automatic Verilog code debugging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited understanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine inference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1) effectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the interactions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and their impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the large space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated framework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling, multi-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It then transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time techniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this objective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS) algorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and available LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon architectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed inference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of 15.1 and 11.2 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models, respectively.

<p>Abstract: To obtain the optimal constraints in complex environments, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) seeks to recover these constraints from expert demonstrations in a data-driven manner. Existing ICRL algorithms collect training samples from an interactive environment. However, the efficacy and efficiency of these sampling strategies remain unknown. To bridge this gap, we introduce a strategic exploration framework with guaranteed efficiency. Specifically, we define a feasible constraint set for ICRL problems and investigate how expert policy and environmental dynamics influence the optimality of constraints. Motivated by our findings, we propose two exploratory algorithms to achieve efficient constraint inference via 1) dynamically reducing the bounded aggregate error of cost estimation and 2) strategically constraining the exploration policy. Both algorithms are theoretically grounded with tractable sample complexity. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms under various environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianda Zhang, Siyuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection models, widely used in security-critical applications, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that cause targeted misclassifications when triggered by specific patterns. Existing backdoor defense techniques, primarily designed for simpler models like image classifiers, often fail to effectively detect and remove backdoors in object detectors. We propose a backdoor defense framework tailored to object detection models, based on the observation that backdoor attacks cause significant inconsistencies between local modules' behaviors, such as the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and classification head. By quantifying and analyzing these inconsistencies, we develop an algorithm to detect backdoors. We find that the inconsistent module is usually the main source of backdoor behavior, leading to a removal method that localizes the affected module, resets its parameters, and fine-tunes the model on a small clean dataset. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art two-stage object detectors show our method achieves a 90% improvement in backdoor removal rate over fine-tuning baselines, while limiting clean data accuracy loss to less than 4%. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first approach that addresses both the detection and removal of backdoors in two-stage object detection models, advancing the field of securing these complex systems against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time-Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA) demands the effective utilization of specific temporal contexts, encompassing multiple time-evolving facts, to address time-sensitive questions. This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.</p>

However, the structures and hyperparameters of deep neural network architectures also make huge difference on the performance in different tasks. The process of exploring optimal structures and hyperparameters often involves a lot of tedious human intervene. As a result, a legitimate question is to ask for the automation of searching for optimal network structures and hyperparameters. The work of automation of exploring optimal hyperparameters is done by Hyperparameter Optimization. Neural Architecture Search is aimed to automatically find the best network structure given specific tasks. In this paper, we firstly introduced the overall development of Neural Architecture Search and then focus mainly on providing an overall and understandable survey about Neural Architecture Search works that are relevant with reinforcement learning, including improvements and variants based on the hope of satisfying more complex structures and resource-insufficient environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that the nascent fine-tuning-as-a-service business model exposes serious safety concerns -- fine-tuning over a few harmful data uploaded by the users can compromise the safety alignment of the model. The attack, known as harmful fine-tuning, has raised a broad research interest among the community. However, as the attack is still new, \textbf{we observe from our miserable submission experience that there are general misunderstandings within the research community.} We in this paper aim to clear some common concerns for the attack setting, and formally establish the research problem. Specifically, we first present the threat model of the problem, and introduce the harmful fine-tuning attack and its variants. Then we systematically survey the existing literature on attacks/defenses/mechanical analysis of the problem. Finally, we outline future research directions that might contribute to the development of the field. Additionally, we present a list of questions of interest, which might be useful to refer to when reviewers in the peer review process question the realism of the experiment/attack/defense setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengchen Zhang, Tong Wu, Tai Wang, Tengfei Wang, Ziwei Liu, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: 6D object pose estimation aims at determining an object's translation, rotation, and scale, typically from a single RGBD image. Recent advancements have expanded this estimation from instance-level to category-level, allowing models to generalize across unseen instances within the same category. However, this generalization is limited by the narrow range of categories covered by existing datasets, such as NOCS, which also tend to overlook common real-world challenges like occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Omni6D, a comprehensive RGBD dataset featuring a wide range of categories and varied backgrounds, elevating the task to a more realistic context. 1) The dataset comprises an extensive spectrum of 166 categories, 4688 instances adjusted to the canonical pose, and over 0.8 million captures, significantly broadening the scope for evaluation. 2) We introduce a symmetry-aware metric and conduct systematic benchmarks of existing algorithms on Omni6D, offering a thorough exploration of new challenges and insights. 3) Additionally, we propose an effective fine-tuning approach that adapts models from previous datasets to our extensive vocabulary setting. We believe this initiative will pave the way for new insights and substantial progress in both the industrial and academic fields, pushing forward the boundaries of general 6D pose estimation.</p>
