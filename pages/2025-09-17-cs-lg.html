<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu He, Chenhan Xiao, Haoran Li, Ruizhong Qiu, Zhe Xu, Yang Weng, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability, electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes, leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and realistic power grid scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Xie, Junqi Yin, Zhenyu Zhou, Sarp Oral, Feiyi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tong, Zhi Lin, Jingya Wang, Meng Han, Bo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier "refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned, nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace. The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs deployment in security-sensitive domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binquan Guo, Junteng Cao, Marie Siew, Binbin Chen, Tony Q. S. Quek, Zhu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters. However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Vatani, Mohamed Elrefaie, Farhad Nazarpour, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration. This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design stages.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12226">A Physics-Informed Neural Networks-Based Model Predictive Control Framework for $SIR$ Epidemics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aiping Zhong, Baike She, Philip E. Par\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$) spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs (MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods under different settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12227">Learning to Route: Per-Sample Adaptive Routing for Multimodal Multitask Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzieh Ajirak, Oded Bein, Ellen Rose Bowen, Dora Kanellopoulos, Avital Falk, Faith M. Gunning, Nili Solomonov, Logan Grosenick</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness through personalized intervention strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> MSR Avinash</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs, especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16). We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint, alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500 tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic case study of LLM fine- tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained researchers and practitioners.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12234">Flexible Multimodal Neuroimaging Fusion for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Progression Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Burns, Yuan Xue, Douglas W. Scharre, Xia Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI, FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of experts than Flex-MoE.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12235">RL Fine-Tuning Heals OOD Forgetting in SFT</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangzhan Jin, Sitao Luan, Sicheng Lyu, Guillaume Rabusseau, Reihaneh Rabbany, Doina Precup, Mohammad Hamdaqa</p>
<p>Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changqing Liu, Kaining Dai, Zhiwei Zhao, Tianyi Wu, Yingguang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered. Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Zhou, Tao Zhou, Xin Li, Stephen Shing-Toung Yau</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer. Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established. We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods, we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern, and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association. Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.</p>

Our approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity, clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency, InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos complex contour formation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacan Yu, Siyi Chen, Mingrui Liu, Nono Horiuchi, Vladimir Braverman, Zicheng Xu, Dan Haramati, Randall Balestriero</p>
<p>Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero, then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately. Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the right equivalence relations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihir Tare, Clemens Rattasits, Yiming Wu, Euan Wielewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context. Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes. Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks, emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.</p>

Utilizing the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset augmented with 2,000 synthetic samples to mitigate class imbalance (total: 2,768 samples, 1,949 positives), QISICGM integrates a self-improving concept graph with a stacked ensemble comprising Random Forests (RF), Extra Trees (ET), transformers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs). This approach achieves an out-of-fold (OOF) F1 score of 0.8933 and an AUC of 0.8699, outperforming traditional methods. Quantum inspired elements, such as phase feature mapping and neighborhood sequence modeling, enrich feature representations, enabling CPU-efficient inference at 8.5 rows per second. This paper presents a detailed architecture, theoretical foundations, code insights, and performance evaluations, including visualizations from the outputs subfolder. The open-source implementation (v1.0.0) is available at https://github.com/keninayoung/QISICGM, positioning QISICGM as a potential benchmark for AI-assisted clinical triage in diabetes and beyond. Ultimately, this work emphasizes trustworthy AI through calibration, interpretability, and open-source reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ngoc Hieu Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: The risk of financial fraud is increasing as digital payments are used more and more frequently. Although the use of artificial intelligence systems for fraud detection is widespread, society and regulators have raised the standards for these systems' transparency for reliability verification purposes. To increase their effectiveness in conducting fraud investigations, fraud analysts also profit from having concise and understandable explanations. To solve these challenges, the paper will concentrate on developing an explainable fraud detector.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes the MT-DQN model, which integrates a Transformer, Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to address the challenges of predicting user behavior and optimizing recommendation strategies in short-video environments. Experiments demonstrated that MT-DQN consistently outperforms traditional concatenated models, such as Concat-Modal, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 10.97% and an average NDCG@5 improvement of 8.3%. Compared to the classic reinforcement learning model Vanilla-DQN, MT-DQN reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize challenges in deploying MT-DQN in real-world scenarios, such as its computational cost and latency sensitivity during online inference, which will be addressed through future architectural optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach, a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the maximum entropy model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangram Deshpande, Gopal Ramesh Dahale, Sai Nandan Morapakula, Uday Wad</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for stock price prediction. Financial markets are inherently complex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional models often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing, offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for stock price prediction and evaluate its performance using historical stock market data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders, financial analysts, and researchers seeking advanced tools for market analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Liu, Qiang Zhou, Hanzhe Li, Chenqi Gong, Jingjing Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals, which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically, we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales. Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow fluctuations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Freedman, Michael Mulligan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model, enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with perishable goods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arth Sojitra, Mrigank Dhingra, Omer San</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liam Ressel, Hamza A. A. Gardi</p>
<p>Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices. Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited training samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Sun, Joshua A. Vita, Amit Samanta, Vincenzo Lordi</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritesh Janga, Rushit Dave</p>
<p>Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection, good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes, setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Vasili, Zachery T. Dahm, Stylianos Chatzidakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output. These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes, while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns, while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a single unified network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Ripper, Ousama Esbel, Rafael Fietzek, Max M\"uhlh\"auser, Thomas Kreutz</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Zayaan S</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding true causal inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingchun Gong, Robert Bogdan Staszewski, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising al- ternative to backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which have enhanced the origi- nal algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational ca- pacity and poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding (ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE lever- ages feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness rep- resentations at each layer, enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present the first successful ap- plication of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely elimi- nating BP and significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Nooraiepour</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential. Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations. However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE < 0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kentaro Nakamura</p>
<p>Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However, existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables. The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied. When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations. Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential measurement errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Wu, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations based on two real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sriram Nagaraj, Vishakh Hari</p>
<p>Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator. We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Rinc\'on-Cardeno, Gregorio P\'erez Bernal, Silvana Montoya Noguera, Nicol\'as Guar\'in-Zapata</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42 times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times 10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruimeng Hu, Jihao Long, Haosheng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics, where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed, non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Crimi, Andrea Brovelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work, we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility, strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Lan, Yuanpu Cao, Weitong Zhang, Lu Lin, Jinghui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhong Qiu, Ting-Wei Li, Gaotang Li, Hanghang Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Li, Zheze Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify different time series features. The inner product of principal component direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks -- achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Bary, Beno\^it Macq, Louis Petit</p>
<p>Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs, prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyuan Zhang, Junwei Deng, Juhan Bae, Jiaqi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the influence of individual training data points on model predictions. Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajun Zhou, Fengtao Zhou, Jiabo Ma, Yingxue Xu, Xi Wang, Xiuming Zhang, Li Liang, Zhenhui Li, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights. Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to 11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts, respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency, MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and improve treatment outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhi Shi, Weiying Xie, Hangyu Ye, Daixun Li, Jitao Ma, Leyuan Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server, leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha = 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650">Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Sik Han, Keon Myung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Li, Yonghuang Wu, Ying Luo, Liangtai Sun, Zishu Qin, Lin Qiu, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR) method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance, run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM) performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS) has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear relationship found for language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Cheng, Jie Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold (z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes. Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an efficient and flexible framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Yang, Guodong Long, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu, Jing Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance, particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.</p>

<p>Abstract: A detailed analysis of precipitation data over Europe is presented, with a focus on interpolation and forecasting applications. A Spatio-temporal DeepKriging (STDK) framework has been implemented using the PyTorch platform to achieve these objectives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Yin, Ke Sun, Han Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free, class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes. In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix (FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Zola, Jon Ander Medina, Andrea Venturi, Amaia Gil, Raul Orduna</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.). Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis. Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves (i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional rule-based detection systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12732">A Novel Recurrent Neural Network Framework for Prediction and Treatment of Oncogenic Mutation Progression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishab Parthasarathy, Achintya Bhowmik</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Schmaltz</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions, and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the softmax.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Halil H\"useyin \c{C}al{\i}\c{s}kan, Talha Koruk</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models and libraries can train datasets of different sizes and perform prediction and classification operations, but machine learning models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wilfrid Sougrinoma Compaor\'e, Yaya Etiabi, El Mehdi Amhoud, Mohamad Assaad</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission, model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms: Federated learning, IoT, finite blocklength, quantization, energy efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12833">Safe Reinforcement Learning using Action Projection: Safeguard the Policy or the Environment?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Markgraf, Shamburaj Sawant, Hanna Krasowski, Lukas Sch\"afer, Sebastien Gros, Matthias Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies, including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL methods based on task characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yabo Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Qingyun Li, Zhen Hu, Kavin Han, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian L. Hines, Samuel Spillard, Daniel P. Martin</p>
<p>Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification (block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying trends in corrupted data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth) models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.</p>

At each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity. Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO) across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haneen Najjar, Eyal Ronen, Mahmood Sharif</p>
<p>Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghong Zeng, Jiong Lou, Zhe Wang, Hefeng Zhou, Chentao Wu, Wei Zhao, Jie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However, its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikang Chen, Xingzhe Sun, Dehui Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels. Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise, etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya Zhou, Yujie Yang, Xiaohan Fan, Wei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance. These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued development of foundation models in the ECG domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns. Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality. Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Chen, Zhaoxi Mu, Andong Li, Peilin Li, Xinyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN) counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while consuming only 14.7% of the energy.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13053">Traces Propagation: Memory-Efficient and Scalable Forward-Only Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Pes, Bojian Yin, Sander Stuijk, Federico Corradi</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients. However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning. Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient, scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes. Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way for efficient learning at the edge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyi Deng, Xin Li, Tingyu Zhu, Zhicheng Yang, Zhijiang Guo, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k, and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8% accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction. Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware alignment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxu Han, Chengzhen Ning, Jinghui Zhong, Fubiao Yang, Yu Wang, Xin Mu</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation, guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Bose, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph spectrum.</p>

<p>Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy, specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Battiloro, Andrea Cavallo, Elvin Isufi</p>
<p>Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs) as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunchuan Guan, Yu Liu, Ke Zhou, Zhiqi Shen, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Serge Belongie, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However, recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13192">TRUST-FS: Tensorized Reliable Unsupervised Multi-View Feature Selection for Incomplete Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Lu, Yanyong Huang, Minbo Ma, Dongjie Wang, Xiuwen Yi, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS, several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francis Ndikum Nji, Vandana Janaja, Jianwu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods, including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck, B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability, advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Nuertey Coleman, Luigi Quarantiello, Samrat Mukherjee, Julio Hurtado, Vincenzo Lomonaco</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information, causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge, facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set, a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Xu, Zikai Zhang, Rui Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL. To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$, which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce $\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL. Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongwen Xu, Zihan Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Didolkar, Nicolas Ballas, Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yin, Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce \textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA (\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++ consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of +0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhong Zhao, Ke Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs) on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities. Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ methods while incurring minimal overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Zhang, Xiaobing Pei, Zhaokun Zhong, Wenqiang Hao, Zhenghao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco</p>
<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used 24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male, mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better, with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meryem Malak Dif, Mouhamed Amine Bouchiha, Abdelaziz Amara Korba, Yacine Ghamri-Doudane</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) envisions a tightly coupled ecosystem of electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, and grid services, yet it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, unreliable battery-state predictions, and opaque decision processes that erode trust and performance. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to deliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable decision support. Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising dedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations, real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly detection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer; develop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify and neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning components; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and adversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts with human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where each agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret intent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric assistance. Finally, we validate our framework through comprehensive experiments across diverse IoEV scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in security and prediction accuracy. All datasets, models, and code will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anisio P. Santos Junior, Robinson Sabino-Silva, M\'ario Machado Martins, Thulio Marquez Cunha, Murillo G. Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems and remains a global health concern, especially with the emergence of new variants. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 detection, it is expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sensitive to issues with RNA extraction. In this context, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis of biofluids offers a reagent-free, cost-effective alternative for COVID-19 detection. We propose a novel architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, referred to as CNN-BiLSTM, to process spectra generated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and diagnose COVID-19 from spectral samples. We compare the performance of this architecture against a standalone CNN and other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms all other models, achieving an average accuracy and F1-score of 0.80 on a challenging real-world COVID-19 dataset. The addition of the BiLSTM layer to the CNN architecture significantly enhances model performance, making CNN-BiLSTM a more accurate and reliable choice for detecting COVID-19 using ATR-FTIR spectra of non-invasive saliva samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riyaadh Gani</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitors often fail outside the lab because existing datasets ignore hardware noise, environmental drift, and person-to-person physiology. We introduce the first ultra-realistic near-infrared (NIR) simulator that injects 12-bit ADC quantisation, +/-0.1% LED ageing, photodiode dark noise, 15-45 C temperature, 30-90% relative humidity, contact-pressure variation, Fitzpatrick I-VI melanin, and diurnal glucose excursions (dawn phenomenon). Using this platform (rho glucose-NIR = 0.21), we benchmark six methods: Enhanced Beer-Lambert (physics-engineered ridge regression), three physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a selective radiative-transfer PINN, and a shallow DNN. Beer-Lambert achieves 13.6 mg/dL RMSE, 95.8% Clarke-A and 93.8% +/-15% accuracy with only 56 parameters and 0.01 ms inference, outperforming the best PINN (14.6 mg/dL) and the SDNN baseline (35.1 mg/dL). Results overturn the assumption that deeper PINNs dominate and supply an open, end-to-end reference stack for rapid prototyping of embedded optical glucose sensors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gautam Sreekumar, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs. InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting 13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weimin Wu, Xuefeng Song, Yibo Wen, Qinjie Lin, Zhihan Zhou, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Zhong Wang, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Genome-Factory, an integrated Python library for tuning, deploying, and interpreting genomic models. Our core contribution is to simplify and unify the workflow for genomic model development: data collection, model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretability. For data collection, Genome-Factory offers an automated pipeline to download genomic sequences and preprocess them. It also includes quality control, such as GC content normalization. For model tuning, Genome-Factory supports three approaches: full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, and adapter-based fine-tuning. It is compatible with a wide range of genomic models. For inference, Genome-Factory enables both embedding extraction and DNA sequence generation. For benchmarking, we include two existing benchmarks and provide a flexible interface for users to incorporate additional benchmarks. For interpretability, Genome-Factory introduces the first open-source biological interpreter based on a sparse auto-encoder. This module disentangles embeddings into sparse, near-monosemantic latent units and links them to interpretable genomic features by regressing on external readouts. To improve accessibility, Genome-Factory features both a zero-code command-line interface and a user-friendly web interface. We validate the utility of Genome-Factory across three dimensions: (i) Compatibility with diverse models and fine-tuning methods; (ii) Benchmarking downstream performance using two open-source benchmarks; (iii) Biological interpretation of learned representations with DNABERT-2. These results highlight its end-to-end usability and practical value for real-world genomic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangqi Yuan, Dong-Jun Han, Christopher G. Brinton, Sabine Brunswicker</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives. Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status. Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow, and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants. Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19 algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sel Ly, Kapil Chauhan, Anshuman Singh, Hung Dinh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: The probabilistic power flow (PPF) problem is essential to quantifying the distribution of the nodal voltages due to uncertain injections. The conventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such a PPF problem are associated with this topology. A change in the topology might alter the power flow patterns and thus require the PPF problem to be solved again. The previous PPF model and its solutions are no longer valid for the new topology. This practice incurs both inconvenience and computation burdens as more contingencies are foreseen due to high renewables and a large share of electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel topology-adaptive approach, based on the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), for finding the solutions to PPF problems under varying N-1 topologies, particularly with one-line failures. By leveraging context set-based topology representation and conditional distribution over function learning techniques, the proposed MMNP enhances the robustness of PPF models to topology variations, mitigating the need for retraining PPF models on a new configuration. Simulations on an IEEE 9-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system validate the model's performance. The maximum %L1-relative error norm was observed as 1.11% and 0.77% in 9-bus and 118-bus, respectively. This adaptive approach fills a critical gap in PPF methodology in an era of increasing grid volatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sasi Kiran Gaddipati, Farhana Keya, Gollam Rabby, S\"oren Auer</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic, open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions. The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and incomplete integration of multimodal content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing deep learning models for chest radiology often neglect patient metadata, limiting diagnostic accuracy and fairness. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaCheX, a novel multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray images with structured patient metadata to replicate clinical decision-making. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier. Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Tavernor, Emily Mower Provost</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition systems often predict a consensus value generated from the ratings of multiple annotators. However, these models have limited ability to predict the annotation of any one person. Alternatively, models can learn to predict the annotations of all annotators. Adapting such models to new annotators is difficult as new annotators must individually provide sufficient labeled training data. We propose to leverage inter-annotator similarity by using a model pre-trained on a large annotator population to identify a similar, previously seen annotator. Given a new, previously unseen, annotator and limited enrollment data, we can make predictions for a similar annotator, enabling off-the-shelf annotation of unseen data in target datasets, providing a mechanism for extremely low-cost personalization. We demonstrate our approach significantly outperforms other off-the-shelf approaches, paving the way for lightweight emotion adaptation, practical for real-world deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present \textbf{VADER} (Variational Autoencoder for Disks Embedded with Rings), for inferring both planet mass and global disk properties from high-resolution ALMA dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model, enables uncertainty-aware inference of planet masses, $\alpha$-viscosity, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, flaring index, and the number of planets directly from protoplanetary disk images. VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from \texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect known disk physics. Our results establish VAE-based generative models as robust tools for probabilistic astrophysical inference, with direct applications to interpreting protoplanetary disk substructures in the era of large interferometric surveys.</p>

Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability. The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction, and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyam Goel, Yufei Wang, Tiancheng Wu, Guixiu Qiao, Pavel Piliptchak, David Held, Zackory Erickson</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes -- structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Zager, Hamza A. A. Gardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector, SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in the out-of-domain setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyze a simple algorithm for network embedding, explicitly characterizing conditions under which the learned representation encodes the graph's generative model fully, partially, or not at all. In cases where the embedding loses some information (i.e., is not invertible), we describe the equivalence classes of graphons that map to the same embedding, finding that these classes preserve community structure but lose substantial density information. Finally, we show implications for community detection and link prediction. Our results suggest strong limitations on the effectiveness of link prediction based on embeddings alone, and we show common conditions under which naive link prediction adds edges in a disproportionate manner that can either mitigate or exacerbate structural biases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinzhanghao Zhou, Tsung-Han Lee, Ao Chen, Nicola Lanat\`a, Hong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui-Feng Wang, Mingrui Xu, Matthew C Bauer, Iago Beffart Schardong, Xiaowen Ma, Kangning Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency, and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8% Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs, maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations. These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis.

Andre Perkins, William Gregory, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Julius Busecke, Oliver Watt-Meyer, William J. Hurlin, Alistair Adcroft, Laure Zanna, Christopher Bretherton</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system by exchanging boundary conditions between separate simulators of the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface, and other geophysical processes. This paradigm allows for distributed development of individual components within a common framework, unified by a coupler that handles translation between realms via spatial or temporal alignment and flux exchange. Following a similar approach adapted for machine learning-based emulators, we present SamudrACE: a coupled global climate model emulator which produces centuries-long simulations at 1-degree horizontal, 6-hourly atmospheric, and 5-daily oceanic resolution, with 145 2D fields spanning 8 atmospheric and 19 oceanic vertical levels, plus sea ice, surface, and top-of-atmosphere variables. SamudrACE is highly stable and has low climate biases comparable to those of its components with prescribed boundary forcing, with realistic variability in coupled climate phenomena such as ENSO that is not possible to simulate in uncoupled mode.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised models, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture generation and its potential application to robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiara Bonfanti, Michele Colombino, Giulia Coucourde, Faeze Memari, Stefano Pinardi, Rosa Meo</p>
<p>Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF. Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Jones, Liyou Zhou, Sebastian W. Pattinson</p>
<p>Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Vujanic, Thomas Rueckstiess</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives, and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengrui Zhang, Yulong Hui, Yihao Liu, Huanchen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However, modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore, \textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that \textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis practical and efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Riaz Hasib Hossain, Rafiqul Islam, Shawn R McGrath, Md Zahidul Islam, David Lamb</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973, RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) leverage machine learning with differential equations to solve direct and inverse problems, ensuring predictions follow physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points) must be carefully tuned. The performance of the PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established traditional numerical and statistical methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YiTong Liu, TianZhu Liu, YanFeng GU</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone navigation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.</p>

To this end, sensed joint torques are collected and processed to foresee the thermal behavior of joint motors. Promising prediction results of the machine learning based capture of the temperature dynamics of joint motors of a redundant robot with seven joints are presented.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Guiffo Kaigom</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry 4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Yihong Hao, Yufei Wang, Navin Sriram Ravie, Bharath Hegde, David Held, Zackory Erickson</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feliks Ba\'nka (Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics,Information Technology), Jaros{\l}aw A. Chudziak (Warsaw University of Technology)</p>
<p>Abstract: In volatile financial markets, balancing risk and return remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches often focus solely on equity allocation, overlooking the strategic advantages of options trading for dynamic risk hedging. This work presents DeltaHedge, a multi-agent framework that integrates options trading with AI-driven portfolio management. By combining advanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based hedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes portfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone models, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management in complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper contributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio optimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options trading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saki Hashimoto, Shoichi Hasegawa, Tomochika Ishikawa, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara, Lotfi El Hafi, Tadahiro Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.'' However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Al-Habib, Zuping Zhang, Abdulrahman Noman</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and improves the few-shot classification via transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model, enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods. Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification, reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and consistency in UC trials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Brandoit, Damien Ernst, Guillaume Drion, Arthur Fyon</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023 GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over traditional 2D evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Sch\"on, Julian Lorenz, Katja Ludwig, Daniel Kienzle, Rainer Lienhart</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario. Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities, an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to 1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12980">Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations: Making SIREN a WINNER</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hemanth Chandravamsi, Dhanush V. Shenoy, Steven H. Frankel</p>
<p>Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep neural network training.

<p>Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

We test AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different shapes across domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many domains, yet their appli- cation to specialized fields remains constrained by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing over- fitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models - when fine tuned properly - can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expand- ing research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Feng, Zelin Li, Pan Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We study sublinear-time algorithms for solving linear systems $Sz = b$, where $S$ is a diagonally dominant matrix, i.e., $|S_{ii}| \geq \delta + \sum_{j \ne i} |S_{ij}|$ for all $i \in [n]$, for some $\delta \geq 0$. We present randomized algorithms that, for any $u \in [n]$, return an estimate $z_u$ of $z^*_u$ with additive error $\varepsilon$ or $\varepsilon \lVert z^*\rVert_\infty$, where $z^*$ is some solution to $Sz^* = b$, and the algorithm only needs to read a small portion of the input $S$ and $b$. For example, when the additive error is $\varepsilon$ and assuming $\delta>0$, we give an algorithm that runs in time $O\left( \frac{\|b\|_\infty^2 S_{\max}}{\delta^3 \varepsilon^2} \log \frac{\| b \|_\infty}{\delta \varepsilon} \right)$, where $S_{\max} = \max_{i \in [n]} |S_{ii}|$. We also prove a matching lower bound, showing that the linear dependence on $S_{\max}$ is optimal. Unlike previous sublinear-time algorithms, which apply only to symmetric diagonally dominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries, our algorithm works for general strictly diagonally dominant matrices ($\delta > 0$) and a broader class of non-strictly diagonally dominant matrices $(\delta = 0)$. Our approach is based on analyzing a simple probabilistic recurrence satisfied by the solution. As an application, we obtain an improved sublinear-time algorithm for opinion estimation in the Friedkin--Johnsen model.</p>

In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushang Zhao, Xinyue Han, Qian Leng, Qianyi Sun, Haotian Lyu, Chengrui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a direct inverse modeling method named SURGIN, a SURrogate-guided Generative INversion framework tailed for subsurface multiphase flow data assimilation. Unlike existing inversion methods that require adaptation for each new observational configuration, SURGIN features a zero-shot conditional generation capability, enabling real-time assimilation of unseen monitoring data without task-specific retraining. Specifically, SURGIN synergistically integrates a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a score-based generative model (SGM), framing the conditional generation as a surrogate prediction-guidance process in a Bayesian perspective. Instead of directly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an unconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture the geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging a differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations conditioned on unseen observations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate SURGIN's capability to decently infer heterogeneous geological fields and predict spatiotemporal flow dynamics with quantified uncertainty across diverse measurement settings. By unifying generative learning with surrogate-guided Bayesian inference, SURGIN establishes a new paradigm for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification in parametric functional spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fragment-based drug design is a promising strategy leveraging the binding of small chemical moieties that can efficiently guide drug discovery. The initial step of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind weakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that relies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and protein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures interaction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well as generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment embeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while being chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein representations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high sensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when sampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our generative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a fraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for fragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and extend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches contribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for fragment-based drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Carlesso, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andi Kuswoyo, Christos Margadji, Sebastian W. Pattinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time, and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Salamatian, Amirhossein Abaskohi, Wan-Cyuan Fan, Mir Rayat Imtiaz Hossain, Leonid Sigal, Giuseppe Carenini</p>
<p>Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allan dos Santos Costa, Manvitha Ponnapati, Dana Rubin, Tess Smidt, Joseph Jacobson</p>
<p>Abstract: Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Millicent Li, Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo, Giordano Rogers, Naomi Saphra, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcio Nicolau, Anderson R. Tavares, Zhiwei Zhang, Pedro Avelar, Jo\~ao M. Flach, Luis C. Lamb, Moshe Y. Vardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational learning theory states that many classes of boolean formulas are learnable in polynomial time. This paper addresses the understudied subject of how, in practice, such formulas can be learned by deep neural networks. Specifically, we analyze boolean formulas associated with model-sampling benchmarks, combinatorial optimization problems, and random 3-CNFs with varying degrees of constrainedness. Our experiments indicate that: (i) neural learning generalizes better than pure rule-based systems and pure symbolic approach; (ii) relatively small and shallow neural networks are very good approximators of formulas associated with combinatorial optimization problems; (iii) smaller formulas seem harder to learn, possibly due to the fewer positive (satisfying) examples available; and (iv) interestingly, underconstrained 3-CNF formulas are more challenging to learn than overconstrained ones. Such findings pave the way for a better understanding, construction, and use of interpretable neurosymbolic AI methods.</p>

Board and Pitt (1990) showed a partial converse of this theorem: for concept classes that are closed under exception lists, any class that is PAC learnable is learnable by an Occam algorithm. However, their Occam algorithm outputs a hypothesis whose complexity is $\delta$-dependent, which is an important limitation. In this paper, we show that their partial converse applies to Occam algorithms with $\delta$-independent complexities as well. Thus, we provide a posteriori justification of various theoretical results and algorithm design methods which use the partial converse as a basis for their work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexia Ye, Yongzi Yu, Weiqi Zhang, Le Wang, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data are ubiquitous across diverse real-world applications, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional approaches are largely task-specific, offering limited functionality and poor transferability. In recent years, foundation models have revolutionized NLP and CV with their remarkable cross-task transferability, zero-/few-shot learning capabilities, and multimodal integration capacity. This success has motivated increasing efforts to explore foundation models for addressing time series modeling challenges. Although some tutorials and surveys were published in the early stages of this field, the rapid pace of recent developments necessitates a more comprehensive and in-depth synthesis to cover the latest advances. Our survey aims to fill this gap by introducing a modality-aware, challenge-oriented perspective, which reveals how foundation models pre-trained on different modalities face distinct hurdles when adapted to time series tasks. Building on this perspective, we propose a taxonomy of existing works organized by pre-training modality (time series, language, and vision), analyze modality-specific challenges and categorize corresponding solutions, discussing their advantages and limitations. Beyond this, we review real-world applications to illustrate domain-specific advancements, provide open-source codes, and conclude with potential future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Expansive Matching of Experts (EMOE) is a novel framework that utilizes support-expanding, extrapolatory pseudo-labeling to improve prediction and uncertainty based rejection on out-of-distribution(OOD) points. EMOE utilizes a diverse set of multiple base experts as pseudo-labelers on the augmented data to improve OOD performance through multiple MLP heads (one per expert) with shared embedding train with a novel per-head matching loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on modality-specific augmentations or assume access to OOD data, EMOE introduces extrapolatory pseudo-labeling on latent-space augmentations, enabling robust OOD generalization with any real-valued vector data. In contrast to prior modality agnostic methods with neural backbones, EMOE is model-agnostic, working effectively with methods from simple tree-based models to complex OOD generalization models. We demonstrate that EMOE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art method on diverse datasets in single-source domain generalization setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Adams, Andrea Patan\`e, Morteza Lahijanian, Luca Laurenti</p>
<p>Abstract: Infinitely wide or deep neural networks (NNs) with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) parameters have been shown to be equivalent to Gaussian processes. Because of the favorable properties of Gaussian processes, this equivalence is commonly employed to analyze neural networks and has led to various breakthroughs over the years. However, neural networks and Gaussian processes are equivalent only in the limit; in the finite case there are currently no methods available to approximate a trained neural network with a Gaussian model with bounds on the approximation error. In this work, we present an algorithmic framework to approximate a neural network of finite width and depth, and with not necessarily i.i.d. parameters, with a mixture of Gaussian processes with error bounds on the approximation error. In particular, we consider the Wasserstein distance to quantify the closeness between probabilistic models and, by relying on tools from optimal transport and Gaussian processes, we iteratively approximate the output distribution of each layer of the neural network as a mixture of Gaussian processes. Crucially, for any NN and $\epsilon >0$ our approach is able to return a mixture of Gaussian processes that is $\epsilon$-close to the NN at a finite set of input points. Furthermore, we rely on the differentiability of the resulting error bound to show how our approach can be employed to tune the parameters of a NN to mimic the functional behavior of a given Gaussian process, e.g., for prior selection in the context of Bayesian inference. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our results on both regression and classification problems with various neural network architectures. Our experiments highlight how our results can represent an important step towards understanding neural network predictions and formally quantifying their uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiu Zhao, Jiaxin Shi, Feng Chen, Shaul Druckmann, Lester Mackey, Scott Linderman</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced, even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate these problems. On the text8 and tokenized ImageNet 256x256 datasets, our informed corrector consistently produces superior samples with fewer errors or improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using discrete diffusion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyi Luo, Mingshuo Liu, Yifeng Yu, Shangping Ren, Yu Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of model compression, choosing an appropriate rank for tensor decomposition is pivotal for balancing model compression rate and efficiency. However, this selection, whether done manually or through optimization-based automatic methods, often increases computational complexity. Manual rank selection lacks efficiency and scalability, often requiring extensive trial-and-error, while optimization-based automatic methods significantly increase the computational burden. To address this, we introduce a novel, automatic, and budget-aware rank selection method for efficient model compression, which employs Layer-Wise Imprinting Quantitation (LWIQ). LWIQ quantifies each layer's significance within a neural network by integrating a proxy classifier. This classifier assesses the layer's impact on overall model performance, allowing for a more informed adjustment of tensor rank. Furthermore, our approach includes a scaling factor to cater to varying computational budget constraints. This budget awareness eliminates the need for repetitive rank recalculations for different budget scenarios. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that our LWIQ improved by 63.2% in rank search efficiency, and the accuracy only dropped by 0.86% with 3.2x less model size on the ResNet-56 model as compared to the state-of-the-art proxy-based automatic tensor rank selection method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manav Vora, Jonas Liang, Michael N. Grussing, Melkior Ornik</p>
<p>Abstract: Monotonic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where the system state progressively decreases until a restorative action is performed, can be used to model sequential repair problems effectively. This paper considers the problem of solving budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDPs, where a finite budget limits the maximal number of restorative actions. For a large number of components, solving such a POMDP using current methods is computationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space with an increasing number of components. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach. Since the individual components of a budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDP are only connected via the shared budget, we first approximate the optimal budget allocation among these components using an approximation of each component POMDP's optimal value function which is obtained through a random forest model. Subsequently, we introduce an oracle-guided meta-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve each of the independent budget-constrained single-component monotonic POMDPs. The oracle policy is obtained by performing value iteration on the corresponding monotonic Markov Decision Process (MDP). This two-step method provides scalability in solving truly massive multi-component monotonic POMDPs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we consider a real-world maintenance scenario that involves inspection and repair of an administrative building by a team of agents within a maintenance budget. Finally, we perform a computational complexity analysis for a varying number of components to show the scalability of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used method in various applications of signal processing and feature extraction. It extends principal component analysis (PCA) and can extract important and complicated components with small variances. One of the major problems of ICA is that the uniqueness of the solution is not guaranteed, unlike PCA. That is because there are many local optima in optimizing the objective function of ICA. It has been shown previously that the unique global optimum of ICA can be estimated from many random initializations by handcrafted thread computation. In this paper, the unique estimation of ICA is highly accelerated by reformulating the algorithm in matrix representation and reducing redundant calculations. Experimental results on artificial datasets and EEG data verified the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the "Belief State Transformer", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.

<p>Abstract: Recent trends in lower precision, e.g. half-precision floating point, training have shown improved system performance and reduced memory usage for Deep Learning while maintaining accuracy. However, current GNN systems cannot achieve such goals for GNN, as our analyses show that they massively underperform while showing abnormal accuracy when using half-precision. These systems suffer from value overflow issues due to lowered precision, under-utilization of hardware resources, and poor training performance. To mitigate this, we introduce HalfGNN, a half-precision based GNN system. HalfGNN proposes novel techniques: new vector operations for half-precision data types that improve data load and reduction performance, and discretized SpMM that overcomes the value overflow and natively provides workload balancing. Such techniques improve hardware utilization, reduce memory usage, and remove atomic writes. Evaluations show that HalfGNN achieves on average of 2.30X speedup in training time over DGL (float-based) for GAT, GCN, and GIN respectively while achieving similar accuracy, and saving 2.67X memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints, crucial for applications like autonomous systems, finance, and resource management. We propose a doubly-regularized RL framework combining reward and parameter regularization to address safety constraints in continuous state-action spaces. The problem is formulated as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Leveraging mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows, policies are modeled on an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with updates governed by parameter distribution gradient flows. Key contributions include solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, smooth bounded approximations for gradient flows, and exponential convergence guarantees under sufficient regularization. General regularization conditions, including entropy regularization, support practical particle method implementations. This framework provides robust theoretical insights and guarantees for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The novel neural networks show great potential in solving partial differential equations. For single-phase flow problems in subsurface porous media with high-contrast coefficients, the key is to develop neural operators with accurate reconstruction capability and strict adherence to physical laws. In this study, we proposed a hybrid two-stage framework that uses multiscale basis functions and physics-guided deep learning to solve the Darcy flow problem in high-contrast fractured porous media. In the first stage, a data-driven model is used to reconstruct the multiscale basis function based on the permeability field to achieve effective dimensionality reduction while preserving the necessary multiscale features. In the second stage, the physics-informed neural network, together with Transformer-based global information extractor is used to reconstruct the pressure field by integrating the physical constraints derived from the Darcy equation, ensuring consistency with the physical laws of the real world. The model was evaluated on datasets with different combinations of permeability and basis functions and performed well in terms of reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, the framework achieves R2 values above 0.9 in terms of basis function fitting and pressure reconstruction, and the residual indicator is on the order of $1\times 10^{-4}$. These results validate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve accurate reconstruction while maintaining physical consistency.</p>

To address these limitations, we introduce a unified residual form that unifies collocation and variational methods, enabling the incorporation of incomplete and complex physical constraints in hybrid learning settings. Within this formulation, we establish that the generalization performance of physics-informed regression in such hybrid settings is governed by the dimension of the affine variety associated with the physical constraint, rather than by the number of parameters. This enables a unified analysis that is applicable to both linear and nonlinear equations. We also present a method to approximate this dimension and provide experimental validation of our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Plaut, Juan Li\'evano-Karim, Hanlin Zhu, Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors, which is problematic when some errors cannot be recovered from. Instead, we allow the learning agent to ask for help from a mentor and to transfer knowledge between similar states. We show that this combination enables the agent to learn both safely and effectively. Under standard online learning assumptions, we provide an algorithm whose regret and number of mentor queries are both sublinear in the time horizon for any Markov Decision Process (MDP), including MDPs with irreversible dynamics. Our proof involves a sequence of three reductions which may be of independent interest. Conceptually, our result may be the first formal proof that it is possible for an agent to obtain high reward while becoming self-sufficient in an unknown, unbounded, and high-stakes environment without resets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R. Johnson, Smita Krishnaswamy, Michael Perlmutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion wavelets extract information from graph signals at different scales of resolution by utilizing graph diffusion operators raised to various powers, known as diffusion scales. Traditionally, these scales are chosen to be dyadic integers, $2^j$. Here, we propose a novel, unsupervised method for selecting the diffusion scales based on ideas from information theory. We then show that our method can be incorporated into wavelet-based GNNs, which are modeled after the geometric scattering transform, via graph classification experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei Takemura, Ryuta Matsuno, Keita Sakuma</p>
<p>Abstract: A central goal in online learning is to achieve adaptivity to unknown problem characteristics, such as environmental changes captured by gradient variation (GV), function curvature (universal online learning, UOL), and gradient scales (Lipschitz adaptivity, LA). Simultaneously achieving these with optimal performance is a major challenge, partly due to limitations in algorithms for prediction with expert advice. These algorithms often serve as meta-algorithms in online ensemble frameworks, and their sub-optimality hinders overall UOL performance. Specifically, existing algorithms addressing the ``impossible tuning'' issue incur an excess $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor in their regret bound compared to the lower bound. To solve this problem, we propose a novel optimistic online mirror descent algorithm with an auxiliary initial round using large learning rates. This design enables a refined analysis where a generated negative term cancels the gap-related factor, resolving the impossible tuning issue up to $\log\log T$ factors. Leveraging our improved algorithm as a meta-algorithm, we develop the first UOL algorithm that simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art GV bounds and LA under standard assumptions. Our UOL result overcomes key limitations of prior works, notably resolving the conflict between LA mechanisms and regret analysis for GV bounds -- an open problem highlighted by Xie et al.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav R. Ghosal, Pratyush Maini, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences, posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yining Huang, Bin Li, Keke Tang, Meilian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for solver operators for various functional problems, yet their stability, generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present a systematic effective field theory analysis of FNOs in an infinite dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for the layer kernel and four point vertex and then examining three practically important settings-analytic activations, scale invariant cases and architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high frequency modes that are otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this frequency transfer. For wide networks, we derive explicit criticality conditions on the weight initialization ensemble that ensure small input perturbations maintain a uniform scale across depth, and we confirm experimentally that the theoretically predicted ratio of kernel perturbations matches the measurements. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for hyperparameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why scale invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning in FNOs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Tang Chang, Shih-Fang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed signals into components (base patterns) and their concentrations (intensity), playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified number of components, usually unknown in real data. Once data or component number increases, the scalability of these MCR approaches face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a data generative process (gMCR), and introduces an Energy-Based solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set and their concentrations for reconstructing the mixed signals faithfully. On synthetic benchmarks with up to 256 components, EB-gMCR attains high reconstruction fidelity and recovers the component count within 5% at 20dB noise and near-exact at 30dB. On two public spectral datasets, it identifies the correct component count and improves component separation over MF-based MCR approaches (NMF variants, ICA, MCR-ALS). EB-gMCR is a general solver for fixed-pattern signal unmixing (components remain invariant across mixtures). Domain priors (non-negativity, nonlinear mixing) enter as plug-in modules, enabling adaptation to new instruments or domains without altering the core selection learning step.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anastasis Kratsios, Dennis Zvigelsky, Bradd Hart</p>
<p>Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenfeng Feng, Penghong Zhao, Guochao Jiang, Chuzhan Hao, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang, Guohua Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the number of rollouts during training. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to improve training efficiency. Moreover, PVPO is orthogonal to other advanced critic-free RL algorithms, making it compatible with and complementary to these methods. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.</p>

In this paper, we introduce second-order tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (SoTPDEG) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for second-order continuous product graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method exploits the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to enable efficient spectral decomposition while preserving high-frequency components. We further provide rigorous over-smoothing and stability analysis under graph perturbations, establishing a solid theoretical foundation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Chen, Jiabao Dou, Jinbao Tian, Yunqi Yang, Zhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced classification tasks.

<p>Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552 unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics, survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results: SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset, exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices: 0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76). Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks. Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and predictive modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saumitra Dwivedi, Ricardo da Silva Torres, Ibrahim A. Hameed, Gunnar Tufte, Anniken Susanne T. Karlsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Nguyen, Adji Bousso Dieng</p>
<p>Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harold Triedman, Vitaly Shmatikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools, and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics, including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance, highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roshni Sahoo, Lihua Lei, Stefan Wager</p>
<p>Abstract: The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making requires access to training data drawn under the same conditions as those that will be faced when the decision rule is deployed. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased in the sense that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called conditional $\Gamma$-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under $\Gamma$-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in a case study on prediction of mental health scores from health survey data and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristian L{\o}vland, Bjarne Grimstad, Lars S. Imsland</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent literature has explored various ways to improve soft sensors by utilizing learning algorithms with transferability. A performance gain is generally attained when knowledge is transferred among strongly related soft sensor learning tasks. One setting where it is reasonable to expect strongly related tasks, is when learning soft sensors for separate process units that are of the same type. Applying methods that exploit transferability in this setting leads to what we call multi-unit soft sensing.
  This paper formulates a probabilistic, hierarchical model for multi-unit soft sensing. The model is implemented using a deep neural network. The proposed learning method is studied empirically on a large-scale industrial case by developing virtual flow meters (a type of soft sensor) for 80 petroleum wells. We investigate how the model generalizes with the number of wells/units. We demonstrate that multi-unit models learned from data from many wells permit few-shot learning of virtual flow meters for new wells. Surprisingly, regarding the difficulty of the tasks, few-shot learning on 1-3 data points often leads to high performance on new wells.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Zhao, Hanwei Zhang, Renjue Li, Ronan Sicre, Laurent Amsaleg, Michael Backes, Qi Li, Qian Wang, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferable adversarial images raise critical security concerns for computer vision systems in real-world, black-box attack scenarios. Although many transfer attacks have been proposed, existing research lacks a systematic and comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we systemize transfer attacks into five categories around the general machine learning pipeline and provide the first comprehensive evaluation, with 23 representative attacks against 11 representative defenses, including the recent, transfer-oriented defense and the real-world Google Cloud Vision. In particular, we identify two main problems of existing evaluations: (1) for attack transferability, lack of intra-category analyses with fair hyperparameter settings, and (2) for attack stealthiness, lack of diverse measures. Our evaluation results validate that these problems have indeed caused misleading conclusions and missing points, and addressing them leads to new, \textit{consensus-challenging} insights, such as (1) an early attack, DI, even outperforms all similar follow-up ones, (2) the state-of-the-art (white-box) defense, DiffPure, is even vulnerable to (black-box) transfer attacks, and (3) even under the same $L_p$ constraint, different attacks yield dramatically different stealthiness results regarding diverse imperceptibility metrics, finer-grained measures, and a user study. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating transferable adversarial images and advance the design of attacks and defenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhua Zhu, Javier Conde, Zhen Gao, Pedro Reviriego, Shanshan Liu, Fabrizio Lombardi</p>
<p>Abstract: The wide adoption of Large language models (LLMs) makes their dependability a pressing concern. Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their impact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important issue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to the internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that need access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that the output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text. Therefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal text, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose to perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts some linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a concurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection mechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs in which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has been evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the OPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of linguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case. The results show that CLED can detect most of the errors at a low overhead penalty. The use of the concurrent classifier also enables a trade-off between error detection effectiveness and its associated overhead, so providing flexibility to a designer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yurui Chang, Bochuan Cao, Yujia Wang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) aim at determining if a data point was part of the model's training set. Prior MIAs that are built for classification models fail at LLMs, due to ignoring the generative nature of LLMs across token sequences. In this paper, we present a novel attack on pre-trained LLMs that adapts MIA statistical tests to the perplexity dynamics of subsequences within a data point. Our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, revealing context-dependent memorization patterns in pre-trained LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William van den Bogert, Madhavan Iyengar, Nima Fazeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile sensing is a widely-studied means of implicit communication between robot and human. In this paper, we investigate how tactile sensing can help bridge differences between robotic embodiments in the context of collaborative manipulation. For a robot, learning and executing force-rich collaboration require compliance to human interaction. While compliance is often achieved with admittance control, many commercial robots lack the joint torque monitoring needed for such control. To address this challenge, we present an approach that uses tactile sensors and behavior cloning to transfer policies from robots with these capabilities to those without. We train a single policy that demonstrates positive transfer across embodiments, including robots without torque sensing. We demonstrate this positive transfer on four different tactile-enabled embodiments using the same policy trained on force-controlled robot data. Across multiple proposed metrics, the best performance came from a decomposed tactile shear-field representation combined with a pre-trained encoder, which improved success rates over alternative representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Irie, Brenden M. Lake</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterize as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Chakraborty, Peter L. Bartlett</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant research on the optimization aspects of federated learning, the exploration of generalization error, especially in the realm of heterogeneous federated learning, remains an area that has been insufficiently investigated, primarily limited to developments in the parametric regime. This paper delves into the generalization properties of deep federated regression within a two-stage sampling model. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic dimension, characterized by the entropic dimension, plays a pivotal role in determining the convergence rates for deep learners when appropriately chosen network sizes are employed. Specifically, when the true relationship between the response and explanatory variables is described by a $\beta$-H\"older function and one has access to $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from $m$ participating clients, for participating clients, the error rate scales at most as $\Tilde{O}((mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))})$, whereas for non-participating clients, it scales as $\Tilde{O}(\Delta \cdot m^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))} + (mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))})$. Here $\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$ denotes the corresponding $2\beta$-entropic dimension of $\lambda$, the marginal distribution of the explanatory variables. The dependence between the two stages of the sampling scheme is characterized by $\Delta$. Consequently, our findings not only explicitly incorporate the ``heterogeneity" of the clients, but also highlight that the convergence rates of errors of deep federated learners are not contingent on the nominal high dimensionality of the data but rather on its intrinsic dimension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Wali Ur Rahman, Yu-Zheng Lin, Carter Weeks, David Ruddell, Jeff Gabriellini, Bill Hayes, Salim Hariri, Pratik Satam, Edward V. Ziegler Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: The flexibility and complexity of IPv6 extension headers allow attackers to create covert channels or bypass security mechanisms, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises. The mature development of machine learning has become the primary detection technology option used to mitigate covert communication threats. However, the complexity of detecting covert communication, evolving injection techniques, and scarcity of data make building machine-learning models challenging. In previous related research, machine learning has shown good performance in detecting covert communications, but oversimplified attack scenario assumptions cannot represent the complexity of modern covert technologies and make it easier for machine learning models to detect covert communications. To bridge this gap, in this study, we analyzed the packet structure and network traffic behavior of IPv6, used encryption algorithms, and performed covert communication injection without changing network packet behavior to get closer to real attack scenarios. In addition to analyzing and injecting methods for covert communications, this study also uses comprehensive machine learning techniques to train the model proposed in this study to detect threats, including traditional decision trees such as random forests and gradient boosting, as well as complex neural network architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs, to achieve detection accuracy of over 90\%. This study details the methods used for dataset augmentation and the comparative performance of the applied models, reinforcing insights into the adaptability and resilience of the machine learning application in IPv6 covert communication. We further introduce a Generative AI-driven script refinement framework, leveraging prompt engineering as a preliminary exploration of how generative agents can assist in covert communication detection and model enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Jaehyun Oh, Sang-Young Lee, Junghwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of the state-of-health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is essential for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficient operation of electric vehicles (EVs). Battery packs in EVs experience nonuniform degradation due to cell-to-cell variability (CtCV), posing a major challenge for real-time battery management. In this work, we propose an explainable, data-driven SOH prediction framework tailored for EV battery management systems (BMS). The approach combines robust feature engineering with a DLinear. Using NASA's battery aging dataset, we extract twenty meaningful features from voltage, current, temperature, and time profiles, and select key features using Pearson correlation and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The SHAP-based selection yields consistent feature importance across multiple cells, effectively capturing CtCV. The DLinear algorithm outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures in prediction accuracy, while requiring fewer training cycles and lower computational cost. This work offers a scalable and interpretable framework for SOH forecasting, enabling practical implementation in EV BMS and promoting safer, more efficient electric mobility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbiao Mei, Jinghong Chen, Guangyu Yang, Weizhe Lin, Bill Byrne</p>
<p>Abstract: Hateful memes have become a significant concern on the Internet, necessitating robust automated detection systems. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Xue, Ke Chen, Zeyi Huang, Yuyang Ji, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflow of machine learning, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingsheng Cai, Jiuming Jiang, Wenhao Huang, Che Liu, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wu, Haoling Li, Xin Zhang, Jianwen Luo, Yangyu Huang, Ruihang Chu, Yujiu Yang, Scarlett Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning extends the performance of Code LLMs beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. In existing approaches, a set of n candidate solutions is evaluated based on test case success rates, with the candidate demonstrating a higher pass rate being labeled as positive and its counterpart with a lower pass rate as negative. However, because this approach aligns entire failing code blocks rather than pinpointing specific errors, it lacks the granularity necessary to capture meaningful error-correction relationships. As a result, the model is unable to learn more informative error-correction patterns. To address these issues, we propose Target-DPO, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. Target-DPO explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To facilitate it, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with Target-DPO achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that Target-DPO yields fewer errors. Code, model and datasets are in: https://github.com/JieWu02/Target-DPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Seung Roh, Joo-Young Kim, Jin-Duk Park, Won-Yong Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p>

SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 18 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 84% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyurae Kim, Zuheng Xu, Jacob R. Gardner, Trevor Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers heavily depends on the tuning of the Markov kernels used in the path proposal. For SMC samplers with unadjusted Markov kernels, standard tuning objectives, such as the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rate or the expected-squared jump distance, are no longer applicable. While stochastic gradient-based end-to-end optimization has been explored for tuning SMC samplers, they often incur excessive training costs, even for tuning just the kernel step sizes. In this work, we propose a general adaptation framework for tuning the Markov kernels in SMC samplers by minimizing the incremental Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the proposal and target paths. For step size tuning, we provide a gradient- and tuning-free algorithm that is generally applicable for kernels such as Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by providing a tailored scheme for tuning kinetic LMC used in SMC samplers. Our implementations are able to obtain a full schedule of tuned parameters at the cost of a few vanilla SMC runs, which is a fraction of gradient-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing trend of legal disputes over the unauthorized use of data in machine learning (ML) systems highlights the urgent need for reliable data-use auditing mechanisms to ensure accountability and transparency in ML. We present the first proactive, instance-level, data-use auditing method designed to enable data owners to audit the use of their individual data instances in ML models, providing more fine-grained auditing results than previous work. To do so, our research generalizes previous work integrating black-box membership inference and sequential hypothesis testing, expanding its scope of application while preserving the quantifiable and tunable false-detection rate that is its hallmark. We evaluate our method on three types of visual ML models: image classifiers, visual encoders, and vision-language models (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining (BLIP) models). In addition, we apply our method to evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art approximate unlearning methods. As a noteworthy second contribution, our work reveals that neither method successfully removes the influence of the unlearned data instances from image classifiers and CLIP models, even if sacrificing model utility by $10\%$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential across diverse domains, from vision generation to language modeling. Transferring its generative capabilities to modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction. However, existing diffusion-based trajectory generative models often exhibit mode collapse where different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process.Therefore, state-of-the-art models often rely on anchored trajectories from pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or scene priors in the training set to mitigate collapse and enrich the diversity of generated trajectories, but such inductive bias are not available in real-world deployment, which can be challenged when generalizing to unseen scenarios. In this work, we investigate the possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the assumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors. Specifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion states serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. Different from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the denoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides the downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or pre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the closed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases TransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore more drivable area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Griffin, Diego Vidaurre, Ugur Koyluoglu, Joseph Ternasky, Fuat Alican, Yigit Ihlamur</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting rare outcomes such as startup success is central to venture capital, demanding models that are both accurate and interpretable. We introduce Random Rule Forest (RRF), a lightweight ensemble method that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate simple YES/NO questions in natural language. Each question functions as a weak learner, and their responses are combined using a threshold-based voting rule to form a strong, interpretable predictor.
  Applied to a dataset of 9,892 founders, RRF achieves a 6.9x improvement over a random baseline on held-out data; adding expert-crafted questions lifts this to 8x and highlights the value of human-LLM collaboration. Compared with zero- and few-shot baselines across three LLM architectures, RRF attains an F0.5 of 0.121, versus 0.086 for the best baseline (+0.035 absolute, +41% relative). By combining the creativity of LLMs with the rigor of ensemble learning, RRF delivers interpretable, high-precision predictions suitable for decision-making in high-stakes domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. However, a plethora of these algorithms require a more rigorous review before making them applicable to the relevant fields. This survey categorizes these algorithms into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their principles, strengths, novelty, and critical limitations. We provide a critique on the novelty issues of many of these algorithms. We illustrate some of the suitable usage of the prominent algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of reliable and authentic advancement of bio-inspired algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Tavella, Amber Drinkwater, Angelo Cangelosi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating textual descriptions from visual data. While these models excel on web-scale datasets, their robustness to the domain shifts inherent in many real-world applications remains under-explored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of VLM performance on a single-view object captioning task when faced with a controlled, physical domain shift. We compare captioning accuracy across two distinct object sets: a collection of multi-material, real-world tools and a set of single-material, 3D-printed items. The 3D-printed set introduces a significant domain shift in texture and material properties, challenging the models' generalization capabilities. Our quantitative results demonstrate that all tested VLMs show a marked performance degradation when describing the 3D-printed objects compared to the real-world tools. This underscores a critical limitation in the ability of current models to generalize beyond surface-level features and highlights the need for more robust architectures for real-world signal processing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miroslav Cibula, Krist\'ina Malinovsk\'a, Matthias Kerzel</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Hickling, Jonathan F. MacArt, Justin Sirignano, Den Waidmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers are the driving force behind today's Large Language Models (LLMs), serving as the foundation for their performance and versatility. Yet, their compute and memory costs grow with sequence length, posing scalability challenges for long-context inferencing. In response, the algorithm community is exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs), linear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as post-transformers. This shift presents a key challenge: building a serving system that efficiently supports both transformer and post-transformer LLMs within a unified framework. To address this challenge, we analyze the performance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite their algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory bandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state updates in post-transformers. Further analyses suggest two additional insights: (1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making per-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision arithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify Microsoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we design Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared between two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a State-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers and adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of state update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to LLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 4.1x and 2.1x higher token generation throughput, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utkarsh Singhal, Ryan Feng, Stella X. Yu, Atul Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception in the real world requires robustness to diverse viewing conditions. Existing approaches often rely on specialized architectures or training with predefined data augmentations, limiting adaptability. Taking inspiration from mental rotation in human vision, we propose FOCAL, a test-time robustness framework that transforms the input into the most typical view. At inference time, FOCAL explores a set of transformed images and chooses the one with the highest likelihood under foundation model priors. This test-time optimization boosts robustness while requiring no retraining or architectural changes. Applied to models like CLIP and SAM, it significantly boosts robustness across a wide range of transformations, including 2D and 3D rotations, contrast and lighting shifts, and day-night changes. We also explore potential applications in active vision. By reframing invariance as a test-time optimization problem, FOCAL offers a general and scalable approach to robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandler Jones, Mark Bandstra, Stefan Faaland, Yue Shi Lai, Nico Abgrall, Scott Suchyta, Reynold Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Ockerman, Amal Gueroudji, Tanwi Mallick, Yixuan He, Line Pouchard, Robert Ross, Shivaram Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Shigui Li, Jiacheng Li, Jian Xu, Zhiqi Lin, Junmei Yang, Delu Zeng, John Paisley, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating density ratios is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but existing methods often trade off accuracy for efficiency. We propose \textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)}, a framework that enables accurate, any-step estimation without numerical integration.
  Instead of modeling infinitesimal tangents as in prior methods, ISA-DRE learns a global secant function, defined as the expectation of all tangents over an interval, with provably lower variance, making it more suitable for neural approximation. This is made possible by the \emph{Secant Alignment Identity}, a self-consistency condition that formally connects the secant with its underlying tangent representations.
  To mitigate instability during early training, we introduce \emph{Contraction Interval Annealing}, a curriculum strategy that gradually expands the alignment interval during training. This process induces a contraction mapping, which improves convergence and training stability.
  Empirically, ISA-DRE achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer function evaluations compared to prior methods, resulting in much faster inference and making it well suited for real-time and interactive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justus Huebotter, Pablo Lanillos, Marcel van Gerven, Serge Thill</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Li, Yikai Wang, Yuying Zhu, Zhongyu Zhao, Ming Lu, Qi She, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO.

<p>Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age, country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness and accountability in NLP within political contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seung Hyun Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional additive regression under the transfer learning framework, where one observes samples from a target population together with auxiliary samples from different but potentially related regression models. We first introduce a target-only estimation procedure based on the smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing. In contrast to previous work, we establish general error bounds under sub-Weibull($\alpha$) noise, thereby accommodating heavy-tailed error distributions. In the sub-exponential case ($\alpha=1$), we show that the estimator attains the minimax lower bound under regularity conditions, which requires a substantial departure from existing proof strategies. We then develop a novel two-stage estimation method within a transfer learning framework, and provide theoretical guarantees at both the population and empirical levels. Error bounds are derived for each stage under general tail conditions, and we further demonstrate that the minimax optimal rate is achieved when the auxiliary and target distributions are sufficiently close. All theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and real data analysis.</p>

A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained licensed bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Akhauri</p>
<p>Abstract: We address when a best-first router for tool-use agents can stop exploring without missing a better leaf, while preserving local differential privacy (LDP) and leaving an audit trail. We introduce a run-wise certificate that couples each node's key to the same exponential race that realizes leaf perturbations; the usual halting rule (stop when the maximum over $v$ in $F$ of Key$(v) \le B^*$) then certifies the realized run. We give two certified modes on context-indexed prefix DAGs with child partition: (i) Exact (known counts), using lazy offset propagation with winner reuse; and (ii) Surrogate (upper bounds only), which anchors keys to a parent-level surrogate race and allows validator tightening via $\kappa = \log(N / N_{ub}$). A small compiler enforces the partition property, and an admissible, race-independent M(tau) keeps keys sound. The ledger logs uniforms, counts, and tie handling; privacy follows by post-processing. Experiments on synthetic graphs and a small real pipeline show tight stopping, deterministic replay, and low overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan A. Karr Jr, Ben Darden, Nicholas Pell, Ryan M. Fryer, Kayla Ambrose, Evan Hall, Ramzi K. Bualuan, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: The National Running Club Database (NRCD) aggregates 15,397 race results of 5,585 athletes from the 2023 and 2024 cross country seasons. This paper introduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete progressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that runners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing 8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those who race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions, including weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the NRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency between genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset accessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where smaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from the internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers a unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance competition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a valuable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw data and applied sports science.</p>

We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical role.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simin Chen, Jinjun Peng, Yixin He, Junfeng Yang, Baishakhi Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems, offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation.
  Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to expose inherent security risks in DL compiler design, opening a new direction for secure and trustworthy ML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kisung You</p>
<p>Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter extends the Euclidean mean to the space of probability measures by minimizing the weighted sum of squared 2-Wasserstein distances. We develop a free-support algorithm for computing Wasserstein barycenters that avoids entropic regularization and instead follows the formal Riemannian geometry of Wasserstein space. In our approach, barycenter atoms evolve as particles advected by averaged optimal-transport displacements, with barycentric projections of optimal transport plans used in place of Monge maps when the latter do not exist. This yields a geometry-aware particle-flow update that preserves sharp features of the Wasserstein barycenter while remaining computationally tractable. We establish theoretical guarantees, including consistency of barycentric projections, monotone descent and convergence to stationary points, stability with respect to perturbations of the inputs, and resolution consistency as the number of atoms increases. Empirical studies on averaging probability distributions, Bayesian posterior aggregation, image prototypes and classification, and large-scale clustering demonstrate accuracy and scalability of the proposed particle-flow approach, positioning it as a principled alternative to both linear programming and regularized solvers.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11598">Disentangling Content from Style to Overcome Shortcut Learning: A Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siming Fu, Sijun Dong, Xiaoliang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters shortcut dependency.To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection. This is operationalized through a synergistic design: (1) a self-distillation objective learns a stable, style-invariant content direction; (2) an analytical projection then decomposes the representation into orthogonal content and style vectors; and (3) a style-conditioned reconstruction objective uses these vectors to restore the image, providing end-to-end supervision. Unlike prior methods that rely on implicit heuristics, this principled disentanglement allows HyGDL to learn truly robust representations, demonstrating superior performance on benchmarks designed to diagnose shortcut learning.</p>
