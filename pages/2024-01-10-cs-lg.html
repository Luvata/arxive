<p>Metasurfaces have widespread applications in fifth-generation (5G) microwave
communication. Among the metasurface family, free-form metasurfaces excel in
achieving intricate spectral responses compared to regular-shape counterparts.
However, conventional numerical methods for free-form metasurfaces are
time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Alternatively, recent studies
demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine
metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial
network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs.
The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can
accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses.
In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN
achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional
methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for
specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design
problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug
discovery.

<p>Species distribution modeling is a highly versatile tool for understanding
the intricate relationship between environmental conditions and species
occurrences. However, the available data often lacks information on confirmed
species absence and is limited to opportunistically sampled, presence-only
observations. To overcome this limitation, a common approach is to employ
pseudo-absences, which are specific geographic locations designated as negative
samples. While pseudo-absences are well-established for single-species
distribution models, their application in the context of multi-species neural
networks remains underexplored. Notably, the significant class imbalance
between species presences and pseudo-absences is often left unaddressed.
Moreover, the existence of different types of pseudo-absences (e.g., random and
target-group background points) adds complexity to the selection process.
Determining the optimal combination of pseudo-absences types is difficult and
depends on the characteristics of the data, particularly considering that
certain types of pseudo-absences can be used to mitigate geographic biases. In
this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges can be effectively tackled by
integrating pseudo-absences in the training of multi-species neural networks
through modifications to the loss function. This adjustment involves assigning
different weights to the distinct terms of the loss function, thereby
addressing both the class imbalance and the choice of pseudo-absence types.
Additionally, we propose a strategy to set these loss weights using spatial
block cross-validation with presence-only data. We evaluate our approach using
a benchmark dataset containing independent presence-absence data from six
different regions and report improved results when compared to competing
approaches.

<p>One of the final frontiers in the development of complex human - AI
collaborative systems is the ability of AI agents to comprehend the natural
language and perform tasks accordingly. However, training efficient
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents grounded in natural language has been a
long-standing challenge due to the complexity and ambiguity of the language and
sparsity of the rewards, among other factors. Several advances in reinforcement
learning, curriculum learning, continual learning, language models have
independently contributed to effective training of grounded agents in various
environments. Leveraging these developments, we present a novel algorithm,
Grounded Language Instruction through DEmonstration in RL (GLIDE-RL) that
introduces a teacher-instructor-student curriculum learning framework for
training an RL agent capable of following natural language instructions that
can generalize to previously unseen language instructions. In this multi-agent
framework, the teacher and the student agents learn simultaneously based on the
student's current skill level. We further demonstrate the necessity for
training the student agent with not just one, but multiple teacher agents.
Experiments on a complex sparse reward environment validates the effectiveness
of our proposed approach.

<p>Cough-based diagnosis for Respiratory Diseases (RDs) using Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has attracted considerable attention, yet many existing
studies overlook confounding variables in their predictive models. These
variables can distort the relationship between cough recordings (input data)
and RD status (output variable), leading to biased associations and unrealistic
model performance. To address this gap, we propose the Bias Free Network
(RBFNet), an end to end solution that effectively mitigates the impact of
confounders in the training data distribution. RBFNet ensures accurate and
unbiased RD diagnosis features, emphasizing its relevance by incorporating a
COVID19 dataset in this study. This approach aims to enhance the reliability of
AI based RD diagnosis models by navigating the challenges posed by confounding
variables. A hybrid of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) networks is proposed for the feature encoder module of
RBFNet. An additional bias predictor is incorporated in the classification
scheme to formulate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) which
helps in decorrelating the impact of confounding variables from RD prediction.
The merit of RBFNet is demonstrated by comparing classification performance
with State of The Art (SoTA) Deep Learning (DL) model (CNN LSTM) after training
on different unbalanced COVID-19 data sets, created by using a large scale
proprietary cough data set. RBF-Net proved its robustness against extremely
biased training scenarios by achieving test set accuracies of 84.1%, 84.6%, and
80.5% for the following confounding variables gender, age, and smoking status,
respectively. RBF-Net outperforms the CNN-LSTM model test set accuracies by
5.5%, 7.7%, and 8.2%, respectively

<p>This paper presents an innovative approach to address the challenges of
translating multi-modal emotion recognition models to a more practical and
resource-efficient uni-modal counterpart, specifically focusing on speech-only
emotion recognition. Recognizing emotions from speech signals is a critical
task with applications in human-computer interaction, affective computing, and
mental health assessment. However, existing state-of-the-art models often rely
on multi-modal inputs, incorporating information from multiple sources such as
facial expressions and gestures, which may not be readily available or feasible
in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework
that leverages knowledge distillation and masked training techniques.

models beyond Dlinear. The paper proposes an U-Net time series prediction model
(UnetTSF) with linear complexity, which adopts the U-Net architecture. We are

testing on 8 open-source datasets, compared to the best linear model DLiner.
Out of 32 testing projects, 31 achieved the best results. The average decrease

its structured nature. We introduce AST-T5, a novel pretraining paradigm that
leverages the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for enhanced code generation,
transpilation, and understanding. Using dynamic programming, our AST-Aware
Segmentation retains code structure, while our AST-Aware Span Corruption
objective equips the model to reconstruct various code structures. Unlike other
models, AST-T5 avoids intricate program analyses or architectural changes, so
it integrates seamlessly with any encoder-decoder Transformer. Evaluations show
that AST-T5 consistently outperforms similar-sized LMs across various

<p>Traffic accident analysis is pivotal for enhancing public safety and

often constrained by manual analysis processes, subjective decisions, uni-modal
outputs, as well as privacy issues related to sensitive data. This paper
introduces the idea of AccidentGPT, a foundation model of traffic accident
analysis, which incorporates multi-modal input data to automatically
reconstruct the accident process video with dynamics details, and furthermore
provide multi-task analysis with multi-modal outputs. The design of the
AccidentGPT is empowered with a multi-modality prompt with feedback for
task-oriented adaptability, a hybrid training schema to leverage labelled and
unlabelled data, and a edge-cloud split configuration for data privacy. To
fully realize the functionalities of this model, we proposes several research
opportunities. This paper serves as the stepping stone to fill the gaps in

<p>Second-order optimization methods, such as cubic regularized Newton methods,
are known for their rapid convergence rates; nevertheless, they become
impractical in high-dimensional problems due to their substantial memory
requirements and computational costs. One promising approach is to execute
second-order updates within a lower-dimensional subspace, giving rise to
subspace second-order methods. However, the majority of existing subspace
second-order methods randomly select subspaces, consequently resulting in
slower convergence rates depending on the problem's dimension $d$. In this
paper, we introduce a novel subspace cubic regularized Newton method that
achieves a dimension-independent global convergence rate of
${O}\left(\frac{1}{mk}+\frac{1}{k^2}\right)$ for solving convex optimization
problems. Here, $m$ represents the subspace dimension, which can be
significantly smaller than $d$. Instead of adopting a random subspace, our
primary innovation involves performing the cubic regularized Newton update
within the Krylov subspace associated with the Hessian and the gradient of the
objective function. This result marks the first instance of a
dimension-independent convergence rate for a subspace second-order method.
Furthermore, when specific spectral conditions of the Hessian are met, our
method recovers the convergence rate of a full-dimensional cubic regularized
Newton method. Numerical experiments show our method converges faster than
existing random subspace methods, especially for high-dimensional problems.

<p>Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is the cornerstone for a
broad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC
fundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether
sufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus,
prevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate
quality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and
preventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency
of the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics,
users' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a
new QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively
estimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and
accordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To
this end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE
admission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level
load dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is
proposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework
for dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission
controller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network
measurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on
context-dependent QoS (reward) predictions. The simulation results show that
the proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance and yield substantial
gains in terms of cell-level service reliability and efficient resource
utilization.

function comes with an input-output pair, leading to two natural tasks: input
prediction and output prediction. First, we propose a generic recipe for

of the benchmark. Second, we evaluate twenty code models on our benchmark and
discover that many recent high-scoring models on HumanEval do not show the same
improvements on our benchmark. Third, we show that simple CoT and fine-tuning
schemes can improve performance on our benchmark but remain far from solving
it. The best setup, GPT-4 with chain of thought (CoT), achieves a pass@1 of 75%

<p>Context: Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in various domains.
However, like traditional software systems, deep learning systems contain bugs,
which can have severe impacts, as evidenced by crashes involving autonomous
vehicles. Despite substantial advancements in deep learning techniques, little
research has focused on reproducing deep learning bugs, which hinders resolving
them. Existing literature suggests that only 3% of deep learning bugs are
reproducible, underscoring the need for further research.
</p>
<p>Objective: This paper examines the reproducibility of deep learning bugs. We
identify edit actions and useful information that could improve deep learning
bug reproducibility.
</p>
<p>Method: First, we construct a dataset of 668 deep learning bugs from Stack
Overflow and Defects4ML across 3 frameworks and 22 architectures. Second, we
select 102 bugs using stratified sampling and try to determine their
reproducibility. While reproducing these bugs, we identify edit actions and
useful information necessary for their reproduction. Third, we used the Apriori
algorithm to identify useful information and edit actions required to reproduce
specific bug types. Finally, we conduct a user study with 22 developers to
assess the effectiveness of our findings in real-life settings.
</p>
<p>Results: We successfully reproduced 85 bugs and identified ten edit actions
and five useful information categories that can help us reproduce deep learning
bugs. Our findings improved bug reproducibility by 22.92% and reduced
reproduction time by 24.35% based on our user study.
</p>
<p>Conclusions: Our research addresses the critical issue of deep learning bug
reproducibility. Practitioners and researchers can leverage our findings to
improve deep learning bug reproducibility.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03077">A Topology-aware Graph Coarsening Framework for Continual Graph Learning. (arXiv:2401.03077v1 [cs.LG])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Han_X/0/1/0/all/0/1">Xiaoxue Han</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Feng_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zhuo Feng</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ning_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yue Ning</a></p>
<p>Continual learning on graphs tackles the problem of training a graph neural
network (GNN) where graph data arrive in a streaming fashion and the model
tends to forget knowledge from previous tasks when updating with new data.
Traditional continual learning strategies such as Experience Replay can be
adapted to streaming graphs, however, these methods often face challenges such
as inefficiency in preserving graph topology and incapability of capturing the
correlation between old and new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
TA$\mathbb{CO}$, a (t)opology-(a)ware graph (co)arsening and (co)ntinual
learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced
graph. At each time period, this reduced graph expands by combining with a new
graph and aligning shared nodes, and then it undergoes a "zoom out" process by
reduction to maintain a stable size. We design a graph coarsening algorithm
based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph and
preserve topological information. We empirically demonstrate the learning
process on the reduced graph can approximate that of the original graph. Our
experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three
real-world datasets using different backbone GNN models.

<p>We present StreamVC, a streaming voice conversion solution that preserves the
content and prosody of any source speech while matching the voice timbre from
any target speech. Unlike previous approaches, StreamVC produces the resulting
waveform at low latency from the input signal even on a mobile platform, making
it applicable to real-time communication scenarios like calls and video
conferencing, and addressing use cases such as voice anonymization in these
scenarios. Our design leverages the architecture and training strategy of the
SoundStream neural audio codec for lightweight high-quality speech synthesis.
We demonstrate the feasibility of learning soft speech units causally, as well
as the effectiveness of supplying whitened fundamental frequency information to
improve pitch stability without leaking the source timbre information.

<p>This work aims at improving the energy efficiency of decentralized learning
by optimizing the mixing matrix, which controls the communication demands
during the learning process. Through rigorous analysis based on a
state-of-the-art decentralized learning algorithm, the problem is formulated as
a bi-level optimization, with the lower level solved by graph sparsification. A
solution with guaranteed performance is proposed for the special case of
fully-connected base topology and a greedy heuristic is proposed for the
general case. Simulations based on real topology and dataset show that the
proposed solution can lower the energy consumption at the busiest node by
54%-76% while maintaining the quality of the trained model.

<p>A genuine signer's signature is naturally unstable even at short
time-intervals whereas, expert forgers always try to perfectly mimic a genuine
signer's signature. This presents a challenge which puts a genuine signer at
risk of being denied access, while a forge signer is granted access. The
implication is a high false acceptance rate (FAR) which is the percentage of
forge signature classified as belonging to a genuine class. Existing work have
only scratched the surface of signature verification because the
misclassification error remains high. In this paper, a consensus-threshold
distance-based classifier criterion is proposed for offline writer-dependent
signature verification. Using features extracted from SigNet and SigNet-F deep
convolutional neural network models, the proposed classifier minimizes FAR.
This is demonstrated via experiments on four datasets: GPDS-300, MCYT, CEDAR
and Brazilian PUC-PR datasets. On GPDS-300, the consensus threshold classifier
improves the state-of-the-art performance by achieving a 1.27% FAR compared to
8.73% and 17.31% recorded in literature. This performance is consistent across
other datasets and guarantees that the risk of imposters gaining access to
sensitive documents or transactions is minimal.

<p>Machine learning methods based on AdaBoost have been widely applied to
various classification problems across many mission-critical applications
including healthcare, law and finance. However, there is a growing concern
about the unfairness and discrimination of data-driven classification models,
which is inevitable for classical algorithms including AdaBoost. In order to
achieve fair classification, a novel fair AdaBoost (FAB) approach is proposed
that is an interpretable fairness-improving variant of AdaBoost. We mainly
investigate binary classification problems and focus on the fairness of three
different indicators (i.e., accuracy, false positive rate and false negative
rate). By utilizing a fairness-aware reweighting technique for base
classifiers, the proposed FAB approach can achieve fair classification while
maintaining the advantage of AdaBoost with negligible sacrifice of predictive
performance. In addition, a hyperparameter is introduced in FAB to show
preferences for the fairness-accuracy trade-off. An upper bound for the target
loss function that quantifies error rate and unfairness is theoretically
derived for FAB, which provides a strict theoretical support for the
fairness-improving methods designed for AdaBoost. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated on three real-world datasets (i.e., Adult,
COMPAS and HSLS) with respect to the three fairness indicators. The results are
accordant with theoretic analyses, and show that (i) FAB significantly improves
classification fairness at a small cost of accuracy compared with AdaBoost; and
(ii) FAB outperforms state-of-the-art fair classification methods including
equalized odds method, exponentiated gradient method, and disparate
mistreatment method in terms of the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

<p>Neural growth is the process of growing a small neural network to a large
network and has been utilized to accelerate the training of deep neural
networks. One crucial aspect of neural growth is determining the optimal growth
timing. However, few studies investigate this systematically. Our study reveals
that neural growth inherently exhibits a regularization effect, whose intensity
is influenced by the chosen policy for growth timing. While this regularization
effect may mitigate the overfitting risk of the model, it may lead to a notable
accuracy drop when the model underfits. Yet, current approaches have not
addressed this issue due to their lack of consideration of the regularization
effect from neural growth. Motivated by these findings, we propose an
under/over fitting risk-aware growth timing policy, which automatically adjusts
the growth timing informed by the level of potential under/overfitting risks to
address both risks. Comprehensive experiments conducted using CIFAR-10/100 and
ImageNet datasets show that the proposed policy achieves accuracy improvements
of up to 1.3% in models prone to underfitting while achieving similar
accuracies in models suffering from overfitting compared to the existing
methods.

<p>As a powerful tool for modeling graph data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
received increasing attention in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, it
is notoriously difficult to deploy GNNs on industrial scale graphs, due to
their huge data size and complex topological structures. In this paper, we
propose GLISP, a sampling based GNN learning system for industrial scale
graphs. By exploiting the inherent structural properties of graphs, such as
power law distribution and data locality, GLISP addresses the scalability and
performance issues that arise at different stages of the graph learning
process. GLISP consists of three core components: graph partitioner, graph
sampling service and graph inference engine. The graph partitioner adopts the
proposed vertex-cut graph partitioning algorithm AdaDNE to produce balanced
partitioning for power law graphs, which is essential for sampling based GNN
systems. The graph sampling service employs a load balancing design that allows
the one hop sampling request of high degree vertices to be handled by multiple
servers. In conjunction with the memory efficient data structure, the
efficiency and scalability are effectively improved. The graph inference engine
splits the $K$-layer GNN into $K$ slices and caches the vertex embeddings
produced by each slice in the data locality aware hybrid caching system for
reuse, thus completely eliminating redundant computation caused by the data
dependency of graph. Extensive experiments show that GLISP achieves up to
$6.53\times$ and $70.77\times$ speedups over existing GNN systems for training
and inference tasks, respectively, and can scale to the graph with over 10
billion vertices and 40 billion edges with limited resources.

<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to the
stability and reliability of online systems. Effective and early detection of
such attacks is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of networks. In this
work, we introduce an enhanced approach for DDoS attack detection by leveraging
the capabilities of Deep Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) coupled with
synthetic oversampling techniques. Because of the inherent class imbalance in
many cyber-security datasets, conventional methods often struggle with false
negatives, misclassifying subtle DDoS patterns as benign. By applying the
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the CICIDS dataset, we
balance the representation of benign and malicious data points, enabling the
model to better discern intricate patterns indicative of an attack. Our deep
residual network, tailored for this specific task, further refines the
detection process. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that our approach achieves an accuracy of 99.98%, significantly outperforming
traditional methods. This work underscores the potential of combining advanced
data augmentation techniques with deep learning models to bolster
cyber-security defenses.

<p>We propose a deep neural network (DNN) based least distance (LD) estimator
(DNN-LD) for a multivariate regression problem, addressing the limitations of
the conventional methods. Due to the flexibility of a DNN structure, both
linear and nonlinear conditional mean functions can be easily modeled, and a
multivariate regression model can be realized by simply adding extra nodes at
the output layer. The proposed method is more efficient in capturing the
dependency structure among responses than the least squares loss, and robust to
outliers. In addition, we consider $L_1$-type penalization for variable
selection, crucial in analyzing high-dimensional data. Namely, we propose what
we call (A)GDNN-LD estimator that enjoys variable selection and model
estimation simultaneously, by applying the (adaptive) group Lasso penalty to
weight parameters in the DNN structure. For the computation, we propose a
quadratic smoothing approximation method to facilitate optimizing the
non-smooth objective function based on the least distance loss. The simulation
studies and a real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed method.

<p>Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a vital role in geoscience to explore the
subsurface. It utilizes the seismic wave to image the subsurface velocity map.
As the machine learning (ML) technique evolves, the data-driven approaches
using ML for FWI tasks have emerged, offering enhanced accuracy and reduced
computational cost compared to traditional physics-based methods. However, a
common challenge in geoscience, the unprivileged data, severely limits ML
effectiveness. The issue becomes even worse during model pruning, a step
essential in geoscience due to environmental complexities. To tackle this, we
introduce the EdGeo toolkit, which employs a diffusion-based model guided by
physics principles to generate high-fidelity velocity maps. The toolkit uses
the acoustic wave equation to generate corresponding seismic waveform data,
facilitating the fine-tuning of pruned ML models. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements in SSIM scores and reduction in both MAE and MSE
across various pruning ratios. Notably, the ML model fine-tuned using data
generated by EdGeo yields superior quality of velocity maps, especially in
representing unprivileged features, outperforming other existing methods.

<p>Alzheimer's is a brain disease that gets worse over time and affects memory,
thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be treated and managed if
it is diagnosed early, which can slow the progression of symptoms and improve
quality of life. In this study, we suggested using the Visual Transformer (ViT)
and bi-LSTM to process MRI images for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. We used
ViT to extract features from the MRI and then map them to a feature sequence.
Then, we used Bi-LSTM sequence modeling to keep the interdependencies between

<p>Many real-world systems exhibit temporal, dynamic behaviors, which are
captured as time series of complex agent interactions. To perform temporal
reasoning, current methods primarily encode temporal dynamics through simple
sequence-based models. However, in general these models fail to efficiently
capture the full spectrum of rich dynamics in the input, since the dynamics is
not uniformly distributed. In particular, relevant information might be harder
to extract and computing power is wasted for processing all individual
timesteps, even if they contain no significant changes or no new information.
Here we propose TimeGraphs, a novel approach that characterizes dynamic
interactions as a hierarchical temporal graph, diverging from traditional
sequential representations. Our approach models the interactions using a
compact graph-based representation, enabling adaptive reasoning across diverse
time scales. Adopting a self-supervised method, TimeGraphs constructs a
multi-level event hierarchy from a temporal input, which is then used to
efficiently reason about the unevenly distributed dynamics. This construction
process is scalable and incremental to accommodate streaming data. We evaluate
TimeGraphs on multiple datasets with complex, dynamic agent interactions,
including a football simulator, the Resistance game, and the MOMA human
activity dataset. The results demonstrate both robustness and efficiency of
TimeGraphs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks. Our approach obtains
state-of-the-art performance and leads to a performance increase of up to 12.2%
on event prediction and recognition tasks over current approaches. Our
experiments further demonstrate a wide array of capabilities including
zero-shot generalization, robustness in case of data sparsity, and adaptability
to streaming data flow.

<p>Alleviating overestimation bias is a critical challenge for deep
reinforcement learning to achieve successful performance on more complex tasks
or offline datasets containing out-of-distribution data. In order to overcome
overestimation bias, ensemble methods for Q-learning have been investigated to
exploit the diversity of multiple Q-functions. Since network initialization has
been the predominant approach to promote diversity in Q-functions,
heuristically designed diversity injection methods have been studied in the
literature. However, previous studies have not attempted to approach guaranteed
independence over an ensemble from a theoretical perspective. By introducing a
novel regularization loss for Q-ensemble independence based on random matrix
theory, we propose spiked Wishart Q-ensemble independence regularization (SPQR)
for reinforcement learning. Specifically, we modify the intractable hypothesis
testing criterion for the Q-ensemble independence into a tractable KL
divergence between the spectral distribution of the Q-ensemble and the target
Wigner's semicircle distribution. We implement SPQR in several online and
offline ensemble Q-learning algorithms. In the experiments, SPQR outperforms
the baseline algorithms in both online and offline RL benchmarks.

<p>Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by
well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion
models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training
data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can
be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find
empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this
limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called
\textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional
training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated
data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i)
the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the
generated data.

<p>Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the security and
maintenance of modern software systems. At present, the primary approach for
detecting anomalies in log data is through supervised anomaly detection.
Nonetheless, existing supervised methods heavily rely on labeled data, which
can be frequently limited in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
semi-supervised log anomaly detection method that combines the DQN algorithm
from deep reinforcement learning, which is called DQNLog. DQNLog leverages a
small amount of labeled data and a large-scale unlabeled dataset, effectively
addressing the challenges of imbalanced data and limited labeling. This
approach not only learns known anomalies by interacting with an environment
biased towards anomalies but also discovers unknown anomalies by actively
exploring the unlabeled dataset. Additionally, DQNLog incorporates a
cross-entropy loss term to prevent model overestimation during Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our evaluation on three widely-used datasets
demonstrates that DQNLog significantly improves recall rate and F1-score while
maintaining precision, validating its practicality.

<p>Training supervised deep neural networks that perform defect detection and
segmentation requires large-scale fully-annotated datasets, which can be hard
or even impossible to obtain in industrial environments. Generative AI offers
opportunities to enlarge small industrial datasets artificially, thus enabling
the usage of state-of-the-art supervised approaches in the industry.
Unfortunately, also good generative models need a lot of data to train, while
industrial datasets are often tiny. Here, we propose a new approach for reusing
general-purpose pre-trained generative models on industrial data, ultimately
allowing the generation of self-labelled defective images. First, we let the
model learn the new concept, entailing the novel data distribution. Then, we
force it to learn to condition the generative process, producing industrial
images that satisfy well-defined topological characteristics and show defects
with a given geometry and location. To highlight the advantage of our approach,
we use the synthetic dataset to optimise a crack segmentor for a real
industrial use case. When the available data is small, we observe considerable
performance increase under several metrics, showing the method's potential in
production environments.

<p>Multi-agent multi-target tracking has a wide range of applications, including
wildlife patrolling, security surveillance or environment monitoring. Such
algorithms often make restrictive assumptions: the number of targets and/or
their initial locations may be assumed known, or agents may be pre-assigned to
monitor disjoint partitions of the environment, reducing the burden of
exploration. This also limits applicability when there are fewer agents than
targets, since agents are unable to continuously follow the targets in their
fields of view. Multi-agent tracking algorithms additionally assume inter-agent
synchronization of observations, or the presence of a central controller to
coordinate joint actions. Instead, we focus on the setting of decentralized
multi-agent, multi-target, simultaneous active search-and-tracking with
asynchronous inter-agent communication. Our proposed algorithm DecSTER uses a
sequential monte carlo implementation of the probability hypothesis density
filter for posterior inference combined with Thompson sampling for
decentralized multi-agent decision making. We compare different action
selection policies, focusing on scenarios where targets outnumber agents. In
simulation, we demonstrate that DecSTER is robust to unreliable inter-agent
communication and outperforms information-greedy baselines in terms of the
Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) metric for different numbers of targets
and varying teamsizes.

<p>Stability analysis is an essential aspect of studying the generalization
ability of deep learning, as it involves deriving generalization bounds for
stochastic gradient descent-based training algorithms. Adversarial training is
the most widely used defense against adversarial example attacks. However,
previous generalization bounds for adversarial training have not included
information regarding the data distribution. In this paper, we fill this gap by
providing generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent-based
adversarial training that incorporate data distribution information. We utilize
the concepts of on-average stability and high-order approximate Lipschitz
conditions to examine how changes in data distribution and adversarial budget
can affect robust generalization gaps. Our derived generalization bounds for
both convex and non-convex losses are at least as good as the uniform
stability-based counterparts which do not include data distribution
information. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate how distribution shifts from
data poisoning attacks can impact robust generalization.

<p>Federated learning is an emerging distributed machine learning framework in
the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In IoV, millions of vehicles are willing to
train the model to share their knowledge. Maintaining an active state means the
participants must update their state to the FL server in a fixed interval and
participate to next round. However, the cost by maintaining an active state is
very large when there are a huge number of participating vehicles. In this
paper, we proposed a distributed client selection scheme to reduce the cost of
maintaining the active state for all participants. The clients with the highest
evaluation are elected among the neighbours. In the evaluator, four variables
are considered including sample quantity, throughput available, computational
capability and the quality of the local dataset. We adopted fuzzy logic as the
evaluator since the closed-form solution over four variables does not exist.
Extensive simulation results show our proposal approximates the centralized
client selection in terms of accuracy and can significantly reduce the
communication overhead.

<p>Despite significant progress in autonomous vehicles (AVs), the development of
driving policies that ensure both the safety of AVs and traffic flow efficiency
has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI
mentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which
facilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon.
Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an
innovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into
AI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves
as a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore
uncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous
situations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the
other hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance,
thereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data
collected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two
training sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually
designing reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action
values from partial human demonstrations to guide the agents' policy learning.
Additionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human
mentor's cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms
traditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of
traffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios. The

<p>With the rapid growth of cloud services driven by advancements in web service
technology, selecting a high-quality service from a wide range of options has
become a complex task. This study aims to address the challenges of data
sparsity and the cold-start problem in web service recommendation using Quality
of Service (QoS). We propose a novel approach called QoS-aware graph
contrastive learning (QAGCL) for web service recommendation. Our model
harnesses the power of graph contrastive learning to handle cold-start problems
and improve recommendation accuracy effectively. By constructing contextually
augmented graphs with geolocation information and randomness, our model
provides diverse views. Through the use of graph convolutional networks and
graph contrastive learning techniques, we learn user and service embeddings
from these augmented graphs. The learned embeddings are then utilized to
seamlessly integrate QoS considerations into the recommendation process.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our QAGCL model over
several existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing data
sparsity and the cold-start problem in QoS-aware service recommendations. Our
research contributes to the potential for more accurate recommendations in
real-world scenarios, even with limited user-service interaction data.

<p>One common approach to solve multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
problems is to extend conventional Q-learning by using vector Q-values in
combination with a utility function. However issues can arise with this
approach in the context of stochastic environments, particularly when
optimising for the Scalarised Expected Reward (SER) criterion. This paper
extends prior research, providing a detailed examination of the factors
influencing the frequency with which value-based MORL Q-learning algorithms
learn the SER-optimal policy for an environment with stochastic state
transitions. We empirically examine several variations of the core
multi-objective Q-learning algorithm as well as reward engineering approaches,
and demonstrate the limitations of these methods. In particular, we highlight
the critical impact of the noisy Q-value estimates issue on the stability and

<p>Domain generalization (DG) aims to improve the generalization ability of the
model trained on several known training domains over unseen test domains.
Previous work has shown that self-supervised contrastive pre-training improves
the robustness of the model on downstream tasks. However, in this paper, we
find that self-supervised models do not exhibit better generalization
performance than supervised models pre-trained on the same dataset in the DG
setting. We argue that this is owing to the fact that the richer intra-class
discriminative features extracted by self-supervised contrastive learning,
which we term silent features, are suppressed during supervised fine-tuning.
These silent features are likely to contain features that are more
generalizable on the test domain. In this work, we model and analyze this
feature suppression phenomenon and theoretically prove that preserving silent
features can achieve lower expected test domain risk under certain conditions.
In light of this, we propose a simple yet effective method termed STEP (Silent
Feature Preservation) to improve the generalization performance of the
self-supervised contrastive learning pre-trained model by alleviating the
suppression of silent features during the supervised fine-tuning process.
Experimental results show that STEP exhibits state-of-the-art performance on
standard DG benchmarks with significant distribution shifts.

<p>In contemporary society, the escalating pressures of life and work have
propelled psychological disorders to the forefront of modern health concerns,
an issue that has been further accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The
prevalence of depression among adolescents is steadily increasing, and
traditional diagnostic methods, which rely on scales or interviews, prove
particularly inadequate for detecting depression in young people. Addressing
these challenges, numerous AI-based methods for assisting in the diagnosis of
mental health issues have emerged. However, most of these methods center around
fundamental issues with scales or use multimodal approaches like facial
expression recognition. Diagnosis of depression risk based on everyday habits
and behaviors has been limited to small-scale qualitative studies. Our research
leverages adolescent census data to predict depression risk, focusing on
children's experiences with depression and their daily life situations. We
introduced a method for managing severely imbalanced high-dimensional data and
an adaptive predictive approach tailored to data structure characteristics.
Furthermore, we proposed a cloud-based architecture for automatic online
learning and data updates. This study utilized publicly available NSCH youth
census data from 2020 to 2022, encompassing nearly 150,000 data entries. We
conducted basic data analyses and predictive experiments, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over standard machine learning and deep

Language model plays a vital role in the downstream tasks of modern NLP.
Extensive studies are carried out on LMs for high-resource languages.
Nevertheless, languages such as Bodo, Rabha, and Mising continue to lack

paper, we propose a novel deep graph clustering framework with temporal
consistency regularization on inter-community structures, inspired by the
concept of minimal network topological changes within short intervals.
Specifically, to address the representation collapse problem, we first

Moreover, a novel neural network regularization TopoReg is introduced to ensure

<p>Sequential decision-making under uncertainty is present in many important
problems. Two popular approaches for tackling such problems are reinforcement
learning and online search (e.g., Monte Carlo tree search). While the former
learns a policy by interacting with the environment (typically done before
execution), the latter uses a generative model of the environment to sample
promising action trajectories at decision time. Decision-making is particularly
challenging in non-stationary environments, where the environment in which an
agent operates can change over time. Both approaches have shortcomings in such
settings -- on the one hand, policies learned before execution become stale
when the environment changes and relearning takes both time and computational
effort. Online search, on the other hand, can return sub-optimal actions when
there are limitations on allowed runtime. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo tree search} (PA-MCTS), which combines
action-value estimates from an out-of-date policy with an online search using
an up-to-date model of the environment. We prove theoretical results showing
conditions under which PA-MCTS selects the one-step optimal action and also
bound the error accrued while following PA-MCTS as a policy. We compare and
contrast our approach with AlphaZero, another hybrid planning approach, and
Deep Q Learning on several OpenAI Gym environments. Through extensive
experiments, we show that under non-stationary settings with limited time
constraints, PA-MCTS outperforms these baselines.

<p>Learning augmented is a machine learning concept built to improve the
performance of a method or model, such as enhancing its ability to predict and
generalize data or features, or testing the reliability of the method by
introducing noise and other factors. On the other hand, clustering is a
fundamental aspect of data analysis and has long been used to understand the
structure of large datasets. Despite its long history, the k-means algorithm
still faces challenges. One approach, as suggested by Ergun et al,is to use a
predictor to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and
a specified centroid. However, it is known that the computational cost of this
algorithm increases with the value of k, and it often gets stuck in local
minima. In response to these challenges, we propose a solution to reduce the
dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is
worth noting that when using k values of 10 and 25, the proposed algorithm
yields lower cost results compared to running it without PCA. "Principal
component analysis (PCA) is the problem of fitting a low-dimensional affine
subspace to a set of data points in a high-dimensional space. PCA is
well-established in the literature and has become one of the most useful tools
for data modeling, compression, and visualization."

<p>We propose a new method to improve the convergence speed of the Robbins-Monro
algorithm by introducing prior information about the target point into the
Robbins-Monro iteration. We achieve the incorporation of prior information
without the need of a -- potentially wrong -- regression model, which would
also entail additional constraints. We show that this prior-information
Robbins-Monro sequence is convergent for a wide range of prior distributions,
even wrong ones, such as Gaussian, weighted sum of Gaussians, e.g., in a kernel
density estimate, as well as bounded arbitrary distribution functions greater
than zero. We furthermore analyse the sequence numerically to understand its
performance and the influence of parameters. The results demonstrate that the
prior-information Robbins-Monro sequence converges faster than the standard
one, especially during the first steps, which are particularly important for
applications where the number of function measurements is limited, and when the
noise of observing the underlying function is large. We finally propose a rule
to select the parameters of the sequence.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03214">Understanding Representation Learnability of Nonlinear Self-Supervised Learning. (arXiv:2401.03214v1 [cs.LG])</a></h1>

<p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has empirically shown its data representation
learnability in many downstream tasks. There are only a few theoretical works
on data representation learnability, and many of those focus on final data
representation, treating the nonlinear neural network as a ``black box".
However, the accurate learning results of neural networks are crucial for
describing the data distribution features learned by SSL models. Our paper is
the first to analyze the learning results of the nonlinear SSL model
accurately. We consider a toy data distribution that contains two features: the
label-related feature and the hidden feature. Unlike previous linear setting
work that depends on closed-form solutions, we use the gradient descent
algorithm to train a 1-layer nonlinear SSL model with a certain initialization
region and prove that the model converges to a local minimum. Furthermore,
different from the complex iterative analysis, we propose a new analysis
process which uses the exact version of Inverse Function Theorem to accurately
describe the features learned by the local minimum. With this local minimum, we
prove that the nonlinear SSL model can capture the label-related feature and
hidden feature at the same time. In contrast, the nonlinear supervised learning
(SL) model can only learn the label-related feature. We also present the
learning processes and results of the nonlinear SSL and SL model via simulation
experiments.

<p>Backdoor attacks present a substantial security concern for deep learning
models, especially those utilized in applications critical to safety and
security. These attacks manipulate model behavior by embedding a hidden trigger
during the training phase, allowing unauthorized control over the model's
output during inference time. Although numerous defenses exist for image
classification models, there is a conspicuous absence of defenses tailored for
time series data, as well as an end-to-end solution capable of training clean
models on poisoned data. To address this gap, this paper builds upon
Anti-Backdoor Learning (ABL) and introduces an innovative method, End-to-End
Anti-Backdoor Learning (E2ABL), for robust training against backdoor attacks.
Unlike the original ABL, which employs a two-stage training procedure, E2ABL
accomplishes end-to-end training through an additional classification head
linked to the shallow layers of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). This secondary
head actively identifies potential backdoor triggers, allowing the model to
dynamically cleanse these samples and their corresponding labels during
training. Our experiments reveal that E2ABL significantly improves on existing
defenses and is effective against a broad range of backdoor attacks in both
image and time series domains.

<p>Diffusion models have become the go-to method for large-scale generative
models in real-world applications. These applications often involve data
distributions confined within bounded domains, typically requiring ad-hoc
thresholding techniques for boundary enforcement. Reflected diffusion models
(Lou23) aim to enhance generalizability by generating the data distribution
through a backward process governed by reflected Brownian motion. However,
reflected diffusion models may not easily adapt to diverse domains without the
derivation of proper diffeomorphic mappings and do not guarantee optimal
transport properties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Reflected
Schrodinger Bridge algorithm: an entropy-regularized optimal transport approach
tailored for generating data within diverse bounded domains. We derive elegant
reflected forward-backward stochastic differential equations with Neumann and
Robin boundary conditions, extend divergence-based likelihood training to
bounded domains, and explore natural connections to entropic optimal transport
for the study of approximate linear convergence - a valuable insight for
practical training. Our algorithm yields robust generative modeling in diverse
domains, and its scalability is demonstrated in real-world constrained
generative modeling through standard image benchmarks.

<p>Recently, Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) has attracted attention due
to its ability to support heterogeneous models and data. To reduce the high
communication cost of transmitting model parameters, a major challenge in HtFL,
prototype-based HtFL methods are proposed to solely share class
representatives, a.k.a, prototypes, among heterogeneous clients while
maintaining the privacy of clients' models. However, these prototypes are
naively aggregated into global prototypes on the server using weighted
averaging, resulting in suboptimal global knowledge which negatively impacts
the performance of clients. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel
HtFL approach called FedTGP, which leverages our Adaptive-margin-enhanced
Contrastive Learning (ACL) to learn Trainable Global Prototypes (TGP) on the
server. By incorporating ACL, our approach enhances prototype separability
while preserving semantic meaning. Extensive experiments with twelve
heterogeneous models demonstrate that our FedTGP surpasses state-of-the-art
methods by up to 9.08% in accuracy while maintaining the communication and
privacy advantages of prototype-based HtFL. Our code is available at

<p>Split Learning (SL) is a promising Distributed Learning approach in
electromyography (EMG) based prosthetic control, due to its applicability
within resource-constrained environments. Other learning approaches, such as
Deep Learning and Federated Learning (FL), provide suboptimal solutions, since
prosthetic devices are extremely limited in terms of processing power and
battery life. The viability of implementing SL in such scenarios is caused by
its inherent model partitioning, with clients executing the smaller model
segment. However, selecting an inadequate cut layer hinders the training
process in SL systems. This paper presents an algorithm for optimal cut layer
selection in terms of maximizing the convergence rate of the model. The
performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm substantially
accelerates the convergence in an EMG pattern recognition task for improving
prosthetic device control.

<p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods are widely used in various
industries to obtain high quality taskspecific solutions with minimal human
intervention. Event Sequences find widespread use in various industrial
applications including churn prediction customer segmentation fraud detection
and fault diagnosis among others. Such data consist of categorical and
real-valued components with irregular timestamps. Despite the usefulness of NAS
methods previous approaches only have been applied to other domains images
texts or time series. Our work addresses this limitation by introducing a novel
NAS algorithm SeqNAS specifically designed for event sequence classification.
We develop a simple yet expressive search space that leverages commonly used
building blocks for event sequence classification including multihead self
attention convolutions and recurrent cells. To perform the search we adopt
sequential Bayesian Optimization and utilize previously trained models as an
ensemble of teachers to augment knowledge distillation. As a result of our work

<p>Confidence estimation of predictions from an End-to-End (E2E) Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) model benefits ASR's downstream and upstream tasks.
Class-probability-based confidence scores do not accurately represent the
quality of overconfident ASR predictions. An ancillary Confidence Estimation
Model (CEM) calibrates the predictions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions use
binary target scores for CEM training. However, the binary labels do not reveal
the granular information of predicted words, such as temporal alignment between
reference and hypothesis and whether the predicted word is entirely incorrect
or contains spelling errors. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel
Temporal-Lexeme Similarity (TeLeS) confidence score to train CEM. To address
the data imbalance of target scores while training CEM, we use shrinkage loss
to focus on hard-to-learn data points and minimise the impact of easily learned
data points. We conduct experiments with ASR models trained in three languages,
namely Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada, with varying training data sizes. Experiments
show that TeLeS generalises well across domains. To demonstrate the

<p>Recent advances achieved by deep learning models rely on the independent and
identically distributed assumption, hindering their applications in real-world
scenarios with domain shifts. To address the above issues, cross-domain
learning aims at extracting domain-invariant knowledge to reduce the domain
shift between training and testing data. However, in visual cross-domain
learning, traditional methods concentrate solely on the image modality,
neglecting the use of the text modality to alleviate the domain shift. In this
work, we propose Large Language models as Visual cross-dOmain learners (LLaVO).
LLaVO uses vision-language models to convert images into detailed textual
descriptions. A large language model is then finetuned on textual descriptions
of the source/target domain generated by a designed instruction template.
Extensive experimental results on various cross-domain tasks under the domain
generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation settings have demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p>We seek to understand what facilitates sample-efficient learning from
historical datasets for sequential decision-making, a problem that is popularly
known as offline reinforcement learning (RL). Further, we are interested in
algorithms that enjoy sample efficiency while leveraging (value) function
approximation. In this paper, we address these fundamental questions by (i)
proposing a notion of data diversity that subsumes the previous notions of
coverage measures in offline RL and (ii) using this notion to {unify} three
distinct classes of offline RL algorithms based on version spaces (VS),
regularized optimization (RO), and posterior sampling (PS). We establish that
VS-based, RO-based, and PS-based algorithms, under standard assumptions,
achieve \emph{comparable} sample efficiency, which recovers the
state-of-the-art sub-optimality bounds for finite and linear model classes with
the standard assumptions. This result is surprising, given that the prior work
suggested an unfavorable sample complexity of the RO-based algorithm compared
to the VS-based algorithm, whereas posterior sampling is rarely considered in
offline RL due to its explorative nature. Notably, our proposed model-free
PS-based algorithm for offline RL is {novel}, with sub-optimality bounds that

<p>In the field of medical sciences, reliable detection and classification of
brain tumors from images remains a formidable challenge due to the rarity of
tumors within the population of patients. Therefore, the ability to detect
tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and
improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep
learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging
situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML)
comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The
detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive
tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and
pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients
of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with
real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the
testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to
Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the
detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor
region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both
in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data
Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer
(ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification
phase. This approach demonstrates promising strides in reliable tumor detection

<p>We study the problem of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning for
reinforcement learning from high-dimensional observations in the context of
realistic robot tasks. Recent offline model-free approaches successfully use
online fine-tuning to either improve the performance of the agent over the data
collection policy or adapt to novel tasks. At the same time, model-based RL
algorithms have achieved significant progress in sample efficiency and the
complexity of the tasks they can solve, yet remain under-utilized in the
fine-tuning setting. In this work, we argue that existing model-based offline
RL methods are not suitable for offline-to-online fine-tuning in
high-dimensional domains due to issues with distribution shifts, off-dynamics
data, and non-stationary rewards. We propose an on-policy model-based method
that can efficiently reuse prior data through model-based value expansion and
policy regularization, while preventing model exploitation by controlling
epistemic uncertainty. We find that our approach successfully solves tasks from
the MetaWorld benchmark, as well as the Franka Kitchen robot manipulation
environment completely from images. To the best of our knowledge, MOTO is the
first method to solve this environment from pixels.

<p>Neural machine translation benefits from semantically rich representations.
Considerable progress in learning such representations has been achieved by
language modelling and mutual information maximization objectives using
contrastive learning. The language-dependent nature of language modelling
introduces a trade-off between the universality of the learned representations
and the model's performance on the language modelling tasks. Although
contrastive learning improves performance, its success cannot be attributed to
mutual information alone. We propose a novel Context Enhancement step to
improve performance on neural machine translation by maximizing mutual
information using the Barlow Twins loss. Unlike other approaches, we do not
explicitly augment the data but view languages as implicit augmentations,
eradicating the risk of disrupting semantic information. Further, our method
does not learn embeddings from scratch and can be generalised to any set of
pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the language-agnosticism of our
embeddings through language classification and use them for neural machine
translation to compare with state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Today, many users deploy their microservice-based applications with various
interconnections on a cluster of Cloud machines, subject to stochastic changes
due to dynamic user requirements. To address this problem, we compare three
machine learning (ML) models for predicting the microservice call rates based
on the microservice times and aiming at estimating the scalability
requirements. We apply the linear regression (LR), multilayer perception (MLP),
and gradient boosting regression (GBR) models on the Alibaba microservice
traces. The prediction results reveal that the LR model reaches a lower
training time than the GBR and MLP models. However, the GBR reduces the mean
absolute error and the mean absolute percentage error compared to LR and MLP
models. Moreover, the prediction results show that the required number of

actual test data without any prediction.

<p>This paper introduces a hybrid attention and autoencoder (AE) model for
unsupervised online anomaly detection in time series. The autoencoder captures
local structural patterns in short embeddings, while the attention model learns
long-term features, facilitating parallel computing with positional encoding.
Unique in its approach, our proposed hybrid model combines attention and
autoencoder for the first time in time series anomaly detection. It employs an
attention-based mechanism, akin to the deep transformer model, with key
architectural modifications for predicting the next time step window in the
autoencoder's latent space. The model utilizes a threshold from the validation
dataset for anomaly detection and introduces an alternative method based on
analyzing the first statistical moment of error, improving accuracy without
dependence on a validation dataset. Evaluation on diverse real-world benchmark
datasets and comparing with other well-established models, confirms the
effectiveness of our proposed model in anomaly detection.

<p>Astronomical observations typically provide three-dimensional maps, encoding
the distribution of the observed flux in (1) the two angles of the celestial
sphere and (2) energy/frequency. An important task regarding such maps is to
statistically characterize populations of point sources too dim to be
individually detected. As the properties of a single dim source will be poorly
constrained, instead one commonly studies the population as a whole, inferring
a source-count distribution (SCD) that describes the number density of sources
as a function of their brightness. Statistical and machine learning methods for
recovering SCDs exist; however, they typically entirely neglect spectral
information associated with the energy distribution of the flux. We present a
deep learning framework able to jointly reconstruct the spectra of different
emission components and the SCD of point-source populations. In a
proof-of-concept example, we show that our method accurately extracts even
complex-shaped spectra and SCDs from simulated maps.

<p>Due to their unsupervised training and uncertainty estimation, deep
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become powerful tools for
reconstruction-based Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD). Existing VAE-based
TSAD methods, either statistical or deep, tune meta-priors to estimate the
likelihood probability for effectively capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in
the data. However, these methods confront the challenge of inherent data
scarcity, which is often the case in anomaly detection tasks. Such scarcity
easily leads to latent holes, discontinuous regions in latent space, resulting
in non-robust reconstructions on these discontinuous spaces. We propose a novel

<p>Hate speech has emerged as a major problem plaguing our social spaces today.
While there have been significant efforts to address this problem, existing
methods are still significantly limited in effectively detecting hate speech
online. A major limitation of existing methods is that hate speech detection is
a highly contextual problem, and these methods cannot fully capture the context
of hate speech to make accurate predictions. Recently, large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several natural
language tasks. LLMs have undergone extensive training using vast amounts of
natural language data, enabling them to grasp intricate contextual details.
Hence, they could be used as knowledge bases for context-aware hate speech
detection. However, a fundamental problem with using LLMs to detect hate speech
is that there are no studies on effectively prompting LLMs for context-aware
hate speech detection. In this study, we conduct a large-scale study of hate
speech detection, employing five established hate speech datasets. We discover
that LLMs not only match but often surpass the performance of current benchmark
machine learning models in identifying hate speech. By proposing four diverse
prompting strategies that optimize the use of LLMs in detecting hate speech.
Our study reveals that a meticulously crafted reasoning prompt can effectively
capture the context of hate speech by fully utilizing the knowledge base in
LLMs, significantly outperforming existing techniques. Furthermore, although
LLMs can provide a rich knowledge base for the contextual detection of hate
speech, suitable prompting strategies play a crucial role in effectively
leveraging this knowledge base for efficient detection.

<p>Diffusion models are the current state of the art for generating
photorealistic images. Controlling the sampling process for constrained image
generation tasks such as inpainting, however, remains challenging since exact
conditioning on such constraints is intractable. While existing methods use
various techniques to approximate the constrained posterior, this paper
proposes to exploit the ability of Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to
exactly and efficiently compute the constrained posterior, and to leverage this
signal to steer the denoising process of diffusion models. Specifically, this
paper adopts a class of expressive TPMs termed Probabilistic Circuits (PCs).
Building upon prior advances, we further scale up PCs and make them capable of
guiding the image generation process of diffusion models. Empirical results
suggest that our approach can consistently improve the overall quality and
semantic coherence of inpainted images across three natural image datasets
(i.e., CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and LSUN) with only ~10% additional computational
overhead brought by the TPM. Further, with the help of an image encoder and
decoder, our method can readily accept semantic constraints on specific regions
of the image, which opens up the potential for more controlled image generation
tasks. In addition to proposing a new framework for constrained image
generation, this paper highlights the benefit of more tractable models and
motivates the development of expressive TPMs.

<p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node and graph
representation learning tasks, the reliability of GNN uncertainty estimates
under distribution shifts remains relatively under-explored. Indeed, while
post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution
calibration, they need not also improve calibration under distribution shift.
However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty
estimates are particularly valuable, as they can always be combined with
post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a
novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty
estimates. Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to
graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support
partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic
networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the
functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling
hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\Delta$UQ on
pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate,
concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\Delta$UQ leads to better
calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves
performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and
generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into
uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\Delta$UQ
in obtaining reliable estimates.

<p>In this paper we consider optimization with relaxation, an ample paradigm to
make data-driven designs. This approach was previously considered by the same
authors of this work in Garatti and Campi (2019), a study that revealed a
deep-seated connection between two concepts: risk (probability of not
satisfying a new, out-of-sample, constraint) and complexity (according to a
definition introduced in paper Garatti and Campi (2019)). This connection was
shown to have profound implications in applications because it implied that the
risk can be estimated from the complexity, a quantity that can be measured from
the data without any knowledge of the data-generation mechanism. In the present
work we establish new results. First, we expand the scope of Garatti and Campi
(2019) so as to embrace a more general setup that covers various algorithms in
machine learning. Then, we study classical support vector methods - including
SVM (Support Vector Machine), SVR (Support Vector Regression) and SVDD (Support
Vector Data Description) - and derive new results for the ability of these
methods to generalize. All results are valid for any finite size of the data
set. When the sample size tends to infinity, we establish the unprecedented
result that the risk approaches the ratio between the complexity and the
cardinality of the data sample, regardless of the value of the complexity.

<p>We consider the problem of predicting cellular network performance (signal
maps) from measurements collected by several mobile devices. We formulate the
problem within the online federated learning framework: (i) federated learning
(FL) enables users to collaboratively train a model, while keeping their
training data on their devices; (ii) measurements are collected as users move
around over time and are used for local training in an online fashion. We
consider an honest-but-curious server, who observes the updates from target
users participating in FL and infers their location using a deep leakage from
gradients (DLG) type of attack, originally developed to reconstruct training
data of DNN image classifiers. We make the key observation that a DLG attack,
applied to our setting, infers the average location of a batch of local data,
and can thus be used to reconstruct the target users' trajectory at a coarse
granularity. We build on this observation to protect location privacy, in our
setting, by revisiting and designing mechanisms within the federated learning
framework including: tuning the FL parameters for averaging, curating local
batches so as to mislead the DLG attacker, and aggregating across multiple
users with different trajectories. We evaluate the performance of our
algorithms through both analysis and simulation based on real-world mobile
datasets, and we show that they achieve a good privacy-utility tradeoff.

<p>Projecting climate change is a generalization problem: we extrapolate the
recent past using physical models across past, present, and future climates.
Current climate models require representations of processes that occur at
scales smaller than model grid size, which have been the main source of model
projection uncertainty. Recent machine learning (ML) algorithms hold promise to
improve such process representations, but tend to extrapolate poorly to climate
regimes they were not trained on. To get the best of the physical and
statistical worlds, we propose a new framework - termed "climate-invariant" ML
- incorporating knowledge of climate processes into ML algorithms, and show
that it can maintain high offline accuracy across a wide range of climate
conditions and configurations in three distinct atmospheric models. Our results
suggest that explicitly incorporating physical knowledge into data-driven
models of Earth system processes can improve their consistency, data
efficiency, and generalizability across climate regimes.

<p>We study the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) between two measures of
possibly different masses with at most $n$ components, where the marginal
constraints of standard Optimal Transport (OT) are relaxed via Kullback-Leibler
divergence with regularization factor $\tau$. Although only Sinkhorn-based UOT
solvers have been analyzed in the literature with the iteration complexity of
${O}\big(\tfrac{\tau \log(n)}{\varepsilon}
\log\big(\tfrac{\log(n)}{{\varepsilon}}\big)\big)$ and per-iteration cost of
$O(n^2)$ for achieving the desired error $\varepsilon$, their positively dense
output transportation plans strongly hinder the practicality. On the other
hand, while being vastly used as heuristics for computing UOT in modern deep
learning applications and having shown success in sparse OT problem, gradient
methods applied to UOT have not been formally studied. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm based on Gradient Extrapolation Method (GEM-UOT) to
find an $\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the UOT problem in $O\big( \kappa
\log\big(\frac{\tau n}{\varepsilon}\big) \big)$ iterations with
$\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ per-iteration cost, where $\kappa$ is the condition number
depending on only the two input measures. Our proof technique is based on a
novel dual formulation of the squared $\ell_2$-norm UOT objective, which fills
the lack of sparse UOT literature and also leads to a new characterization of
approximation error between UOT and OT. To this end, we further present a novel
approach of OT retrieval from UOT, which is based on GEM-UOT with fine tuned
$\tau$ and a post-process projection step. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real datasets validate our theories and demonstrate the favorable
performance of our methods in practice.

<p>Quantum support vector machines employ quantum circuits to define the kernel
function. It has been shown that this approach offers a provable exponential
speedup compared to any known classical algorithm for certain data sets. The
training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem
either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of
quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical
uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the
dual problem can be solved in $O(M^{4.67}/\varepsilon^2)$ quantum circuit
evaluations, where $M$ denotes the size of the data set and $\varepsilon$ the
solution accuracy compared to the ideal result from exact expectation values,
which is only obtainable in theory. We prove under an empirically motivated
assumption that the kernelized primal problem can alternatively be solved in
$O(\min \{ M^2/\varepsilon^6, \, 1/\varepsilon^{10} \})$ evaluations by
employing a generalization of a known classical algorithm called Pegasos.
Accompanying empirical results demonstrate these analytical complexities to be
essentially tight. In addition, we investigate a variational approximation to
quantum support vector machines and show that their heuristic training achieves
considerably better scaling in our experiments.

<p>Lipschitz constants of neural networks allow for guarantees of robustness in
image classification, safety in controller design, and generalizability beyond
the training data. As calculating Lipschitz constants is NP-hard, techniques
for estimating Lipschitz constants must navigate the trade-off between
scalability and accuracy. In this work, we significantly push the scalability
frontier of a semidefinite programming technique known as LipSDP while
achieving zero accuracy loss. We first show that LipSDP has chordal sparsity,
which allows us to derive a chordally sparse formulation that we call
Chordal-LipSDP. The key benefit is that the main computational bottleneck of
LipSDP, a large semidefinite constraint, is now decomposed into an equivalent
collection of smaller ones: allowing Chordal-LipSDP to outperform LipSDP
particularly as the network depth grows. Moreover, our formulation uses a
tunable sparsity parameter that enables one to gain tighter estimates without
incurring a significant computational cost. We illustrate the scalability of
our approach through extensive numerical experiments.

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been utilized to build
Collaborative Filtering (CF) models to predict user preferences based on
historical user-item interactions. However, there is relatively little
understanding of how GNN-based CF models relate to some traditional Network
Representation Learning (NRL) approaches. In this paper, we show the
equivalence between some state-of-the-art GNN-based CF models and a traditional
1-layer NRL model based on context encoding. Based on a Markov process that
trades off two types of distances, we present Markov Graph Diffusion
Collaborative Filtering (MGDCF) to generalize some state-of-the-art GNN-based
CF models. Instead of considering the GNN as a trainable black box that
propagates learnable user/item vertex embeddings, we treat GNNs as an
untrainable Markov process that can construct constant context features of
vertices for a traditional NRL model that encodes context features with a
fully-connected layer. Such simplification can help us to better understand how
GNNs benefit CF models. Especially, it helps us realize that ranking losses
play crucial roles in GNN-based CF tasks. With our proposed simple yet powerful
ranking loss InfoBPR, the NRL model can still perform well without the context
features constructed by GNNs. We conduct experiments to perform detailed
analysis on MGDCF.

<p>The stochastic block model is a canonical random graph model for clustering
and community detection on network-structured data. Decades of extensive study
on the problem have established many profound results, among which the phase
transition at the Kesten-Stigum threshold is particularly interesting both from
a mathematical and an applied standpoint. It states that no estimator based on
the network topology can perform substantially better than chance on sparse
graphs if the model parameter is below certain threshold. Nevertheless, if we
slightly extend the horizon to the ubiquitous semi-supervised setting, such a
fundamental limitation will disappear completely. We prove that with arbitrary
fraction of the labels revealed, the detection problem is feasible throughout
the parameter domain. Moreover, we introduce two efficient algorithms, one
combinatorial and one based on optimization, to integrate label information
with graph structures. Our work brings a new perspective to stochastic model of
networks and semidefinite program research.

<p>We introduce and study a new variant of the multi-armed bandit problem (MAB),
called the survival bandit problem (S-MAB). While in both problems, the
objective is to maximize the so-called cumulative reward, in this new variant,
the procedure is interrupted if the cumulative reward falls below a preset
threshold. This simple yet unexplored extension of the MAB follows from many
practical applications. For example, when testing two medicines against each
other on voluntary patients, people's health are at stake, and it is necessary
to be able to interrupt experiments if serious side effects occur or if the
disease syndromes are not dissipated by the treatment. From a theoretical
perspective, the S-MAB is the first variant of the MAB where the procedure may
or may not be interrupted. We start by formalizing the S-MAB and we define its
objective as the minimization of the so-called survival regret, which naturally
generalizes the regret of the MAB. Then, we show that the objective of the
S-MAB is considerably more difficult than the MAB, in the sense that contrary
to the MAB, no policy can achieve a reasonably small (i.e., sublinear) survival
regret. Instead, we minimize the survival regret in the sense of Pareto, i.e.,
we seek a policy whose cumulative reward cannot be improved for some problem
instance without being sacrificed for another one. For that purpose, we
identify two key components in the survival regret: the regret given no ruin
(which corresponds to the regret in the MAB), and the probability that the
procedure is interrupted, called the probability of ruin. We derive a lower
bound on the probability of ruin, as well as policies whose probability of ruin
matches the lower bound. Finally, based on a doubling trick on those policies,
we derive a policy which minimizes the survival regret in the sense of Pareto,
giving an answer to an open problem by Perotto et al. (COLT 2019).

<p>The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to bring
transparency to today's powerful but opaque deep learning models. While local
XAI methods explain individual predictions in form of attribution maps, thereby
identifying where important features occur (but not providing information about
what they represent), global explanation techniques visualize what concepts a
model has generally learned to encode. Both types of methods thus only provide
partial insights and leave the burden of interpreting the model's reasoning to
the user. In this work we introduce the Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP)
approach, which combines the local and global perspectives and thus allows
answering both the "where" and "what" questions for individual predictions. We
demonstrate the capability of our method in various settings, showcasing that
CRP leads to more human interpretable explanations and provides deep insights
into the model's representation and reasoning through concept atlases, concept
composition analyses, and quantitative investigations of concept subspaces and
their role in fine-grained decision making.

<p>Neural networks are central to many emerging technologies, but verifying
their correctness remains a major challenge. It is known that network outputs
can be sensitive and fragile to even small input perturbations, thereby
increasing the risk of unpredictable and undesirable behavior. Fast and
accurate verification of neural networks is therefore critical to their
widespread adoption, and in recent years, various methods have been developed
as a response to this problem. In this paper, we focus on improving
semidefinite programming (SDP) based techniques for neural network
verification. Such techniques offer the power of expressing complex geometric
constraints while retaining a convex problem formulation, but scalability
remains a major issue in practice. Our starting point is the DeepSDP framework
proposed by Fazlyab et al., which uses quadratic constraints to abstract the
verification problem into a large-scale SDP. However, solving this SDP quickly
becomes intractable when the network grows. Our key observation is that by
leveraging chordal sparsity, we can decompose the primary computational
bottleneck of DeepSDP -- a large linear matrix inequality (LMI) -- into an
equivalent collection of smaller LMIs. We call our chordally sparse
optimization program Chordal-DeepSDP and prove that its construction is
identically expressive as that of DeepSDP. Moreover, we show that additional
analysis of Chordal-DeepSDP allows us to further rewrite its collection of LMIs
in a second level of decomposition that we call Chordal-DeepSDP-2 -- which
results in another significant computational gain. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments on real networks of learned cart-pole dynamics,
showcasing the computational advantage of Chordal-DeepSDP and Chordal-DeepSDP-2
over DeepSDP.

<p>We propose a margin-based loss for tuning joint vision-language models so
that their gradient-based explanations are consistent with region-level
annotations provided by humans for relatively smaller grounding datasets. We
refer to this objective as Attention Mask Consistency (AMC) and demonstrate
that it produces superior visual grounding results than previous methods that
rely on using vision-language models to score the outputs of object detectors.
Particularly, a model trained with AMC on top of standard vision-language
modeling objectives obtains a state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.49% in the
Flickr30k visual grounding benchmark, an absolute improvement of 5.38% when
compared to the best previous model trained under the same level of
supervision. Our approach also performs exceedingly well on established
benchmarks for referring expression comprehension where it obtains 80.34%
accuracy in the easy test of RefCOCO+, and 64.55% in the difficult split. AMC
is effective, easy to implement, and is general as it can be adopted by any
vision-language model, and can use any type of region annotations.

<p>Most reinforcement learning algorithms seek a single optimal strategy that
solves a given task. However, it can often be valuable to learn a diverse set
of solutions, for instance, to make an agent's interaction with users more
engaging, or improve the robustness of a policy to an unexpected perturbance.
We propose Diversity-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), an on-policy algorithm
that discovers multiple strategies for solving a given task. Unlike prior work,
it achieves this with a shared policy network trained over a single run.
Specifically, we design an intrinsic reward based on an information-theoretic
diversity objective. Our final objective alternately constraints on the
diversity of the strategies and on the extrinsic reward. We solve the
constrained optimization problem by casting it as a probabilistic inference
task and use policy iteration to maximize the derived lower bound. Experimental
results show that our method efficiently discovers diverse strategies in a wide
variety of reinforcement learning tasks. Compared to baseline methods, DGPO
achieves comparable rewards, while discovering more diverse strategies, and
often with better sample efficiency.

<p>Pruning neural networks has become popular in the last decade when it was
shown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural
networks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been
proposed since, each claiming to be better than prior art, however, at the cost
of increasingly complex pruning methodologies. These methodologies include
utilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or
having heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. In this work, we question
whether this pattern of introducing complexity is really necessary to achieve
better pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against a simple
pruning baseline, namely, Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP), that ranks
weights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones.
Surprisingly, we find that vanilla Global MP performs very well against the
SOTA techniques. When considering sparsity-accuracy trade-off, Global MP
performs better than all SOTA techniques at all sparsity ratios. When
considering FLOPs-accuracy trade-off, some SOTA techniques outperform Global MP
at lower sparsity ratios, however, Global MP starts performing well at high
sparsity ratios and performs very well at extremely high sparsity ratios.
Moreover, we find that a common issue that many pruning algorithms run into at
high sparsity rates, namely, layer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP.
We explore why layer collapse occurs in networks and how it can be mitigated in
Global MP by utilizing a technique called Minimum Threshold. We showcase the
above findings on various models (WRN-28-8, ResNet-32, ResNet-50, MobileNet-V1
and FastGRNN) and multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet and HAR-2). Code is

<p>We investigate the utility of deep learning for modeling the clustering of
particles that are aerodynamically coupled to turbulent fluids. Using a
Lagrangian particle module within the Athena++ hydrodynamics code, we simulate
the dynamics of particles in the Epstein drag regime within a periodic domain
of isotropic forced hydrodynamic turbulence. This setup is an idealized model
relevant to the collisional growth of micron to mm-sized dust particles in
early stage planet formation. The simulation data are used to train a U-Net
deep learning model to predict gridded three-dimensional representations of the
particle density and velocity fields, given as input the corresponding fluid
fields. The trained model qualitatively captures the filamentary structure of
clustered particles in a highly non-linear regime. We assess model fidelity by
calculating metrics of the density field (the radial distribution function) and
of the velocity field (the relative velocity and the relative radial velocity
between particles). Although trained only on the spatial fields, the model
predicts these statistical quantities with errors that are typically &lt;10%. Our
results suggest that, given appropriately expanded training data, deep learning
could complement direct numerical simulations in predicting particle clustering
within turbulent flows.

<p>While recent research advances in speaker diarization mostly focus on
improving the quality of diarization results, there is also an increasing
interest in improving the efficiency of diarization systems. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a multi-stage clustering strategy that uses different
clustering algorithms for input of different lengths can address multi-faceted
challenges of on-device speaker diarization applications. Specifically, a
fallback clusterer is used to handle short-form inputs; a main clusterer is
used to handle medium-length inputs; and a pre-clusterer is used to compress
long-form inputs before they are processed by the main clusterer. Both the main
clusterer and the pre-clusterer can be configured with an upper bound of the
computational complexity to adapt to devices with different resource
constraints. This multi-stage clustering strategy is critical for streaming
on-device speaker diarization systems, where the budgets of CPU, memory and
battery are tight.

system and thus must be carefully tested. When an SDN-based system fails, in
order to address such a failure, engineers need to precisely understand the
conditions under which it occurs. In this article, we introduce a machine
learning-guided fuzzing method, named FuzzSDN, aiming at both (1) generating
effective test data leading to failures in SDN-based systems and (2) learning
accurate failure-inducing models that characterize conditions under which such
system fails. To our knowledge, no existing work simultaneously addresses these
two objectives for SDNs. We evaluate FuzzSDN by applying it to systems
controlled by two open-source SDN controllers. Further, we compare FuzzSDN with
two state-of-the-art methods for fuzzing SDNs and two baselines for learning
failure-inducing models. Our results show that (1) compared to the
state-of-the-art methods, FuzzSDN generates at least 12 times more failures,
within the same time budget, with a controller that is fairly robust to fuzzing
and (2) our failure-inducing models have, on average, a precision of 98% and a
recall of 86%, significantly outperforming the baselines.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04370">NESTER: An Adaptive Neurosymbolic Method for Causal Effect Estimation. (arXiv:2211.04370v5 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Causal effect estimation from observational data is a central problem in
causal inference. Methods based on potential outcomes framework solve this
problem by exploiting inductive biases and heuristics from causal inference.
Each of these methods addresses a specific aspect of causal effect estimation,
such as controlling propensity score, enforcing randomization, etc., by
designing neural network (NN) architectures and regularizers. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive method called Neurosymbolic Causal Effect Estimator
(NESTER), a generalized method for causal effect estimation. NESTER integrates
the ideas used in existing methods based on multi-head NNs for causal effect
estimation into one framework. We design a Domain Specific Language (DSL)
tailored for causal effect estimation based on causal inductive biases used in
literature. We conduct a theoretical analysis to investigate NESTER's efficacy
in estimating causal effects. Our comprehensive empirical results show that
NESTER performs better than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

<p>The robustness of image classifiers is essential to their deployment in the
real world. The ability to assess this resilience to manipulations or
deviations from the training data is thus crucial. These modifications have
traditionally consisted of minimal changes that still manage to fool
classifiers, and modern approaches are increasingly robust to them. Semantic
manipulations that modify elements of an image in meaningful ways have thus
gained traction for this purpose. However, they have primarily been limited to
style, color, or attribute changes. While expressive, these manipulations do
not make use of the full capabilities of a pretrained generative model. In this
work, we aim to bridge this gap. We show how a pretrained image generator can
be used to semantically manipulate images in a detailed, diverse, and
photorealistic way while still preserving the class of the original image.
Inspired by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method
called Adversarial Pivotal Tuning (APT). Given an image, APT first finds a
pivot latent space input that reconstructs the image using a pretrained
generator. It then adjusts the generator's weights to create small yet semantic
manipulations in order to fool a pretrained classifier. APT preserves the full
expressive editing capabilities of the generative model. We demonstrate that
APT is capable of a wide range of class-preserving semantic image manipulations
that fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. Finally, we show that
classifiers that are robust to other benchmarks are not robust to APT
manipulations and suggest a method to improve them. Code available at:

<p>By distributing the training process, local approximation reduces the cost of
the standard Gaussian Process. An ensemble technique combines local predictions
from Gaussian experts trained on different partitions of the data. Ensemble
methods aggregate models' predictions by assuming a perfect diversity of local
predictors. Although it keeps the aggregation tractable, this assumption is
often violated in practice. Even though ensemble methods provide consistent
results by assuming dependencies between experts, they have a high
computational cost, which is cubic in the number of experts involved. By
implementing an expert selection strategy, the final aggregation step uses
fewer experts and is more efficient. However, a selection approach that assigns
a fixed set of experts to each new data point cannot encode the specific
properties of each unique data point. This paper proposes a flexible expert
selection approach based on the characteristics of entry data points. To this
end, we investigate the selection task as a multi-label classification problem
where the experts define labels, and each entry point is assigned to some
experts. The proposed solution's prediction quality, efficiency, and asymptotic
properties are discussed in detail. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method
through extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world data
sets.

<p>Healthcare continues to grapple with the persistent issue of treatment
disparities, sparking concerns regarding the equitable allocation of treatments
in clinical practice. While various fairness metrics have emerged to assess
fairness in decision-making processes, a growing focus has been on
causality-based fairness concepts due to their capacity to mitigate confounding
effects and reason about bias. However, the application of causal fairness
notions in evaluating the fairness of clinical decision-making with electronic
health record (EHR) data remains an understudied domain. This study aims to
address the methodological gap in assessing causal fairness of treatment
allocation with electronic health records data. We propose a causal fairness
algorithm to assess fairness in clinical decision-making. Our algorithm
accounts for the heterogeneity of patient populations and identifies potential
unfairness in treatment allocation by conditioning on patients who have the
same likelihood to benefit from the treatment. We apply this framework to a
patient cohort with coronary artery disease derived from an EHR database to
evaluate the fairness of treatment decisions. In addition, we investigate the
impact of social determinants of health on the assessment of causal fairness of
treatment allocation.

time-reversal equivariant neural network to learn high-order spin-lattice

SpinGNN++, a complex magnetic model dataset is introduced as a benchmark and
employed to demonstrate its capabilities. SpinGNN++ provides accurate

<p>As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in safety critical
and privacy sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and biometric
authentication, it is critical to understand the fault-tolerance nature of
DNNs. Prior work primarily focuses on metrics such as Failures In Time (FIT)
rate and the Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate, which quantify how often a
device fails. Instead, this paper focuses on quantifying the DNN accuracy given
that a transient error has occurred, which tells us how well a network behaves
when a transient error occurs. We call this metric Resiliency Accuracy (RA). We
show that existing RA formulation is fundamentally inaccurate, because it
incorrectly assumes that software variables (model weights/activations) have
equal faulty probability under hardware transient faults. We present an
algorithm that captures the faulty probabilities of DNN variables under
transient faults and, thus, provides correct RA estimations validated by
hardware. To accelerate RA estimation, we reformulate RA calculation as a Monte
Carlo integration problem, and solve it using importance sampling driven by DNN
specific heuristics. Using our lightweight RA estimation method, we show that
transient faults lead to far greater accuracy degradation than what todays DNN
resiliency tools estimate. We show how our RA estimation tool can help design
more resilient DNNs by integrating it with a Network Architecture Search
framework.

<p>Despite a sea of interpretability methods that can produce plausible
explanations, the field has also empirically seen many failure cases of such
methods. In light of these results, it remains unclear for practitioners how to
use these methods and choose between them in a principled way. In this paper,
we show that for moderately rich model classes (easily satisfied by neural
networks), any feature attribution method that is complete and linear -- for
example, Integrated Gradients and SHAP -- can provably fail to improve on
random guessing for inferring model behaviour. Our results apply to common
end-tasks such as characterizing local model behaviour, identifying spurious
features, and algorithmic recourse. One takeaway from our work is the
importance of concretely defining end-tasks: once such an end-task is defined,
a simple and direct approach of repeated model evaluations can outperform many
other complex feature attribution methods.

<p>Solving real-world optimal control problems are challenging tasks, as the

numerically. To deal with such modeling and computation challenges, in this
paper, we integrate Neural Networks with the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle
(PMP), and propose a sample efficient framework NN-PMP-Gradient. The resulting
controller can be implemented for systems with unknown and complex dynamics. By
taking an iterative approach, the proposed framework not only utilizes the
accurate surrogate models parameterized by neural networks, it also efficiently
recovers the optimality conditions along with the optimal action sequences via
PMP conditions. Numerical simulations on Linear Quadratic Regulator, energy
arbitrage of grid-connected lossy battery, control of single pendulum, and two
MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate our proposed NN-PMP-Gradient is a general

<p>A compression function is a map that slims down an observational set into a
subset of reduced size, while preserving its informational content. In multiple
applications, the condition that one new observation makes the compressed set
change is interpreted that this observation brings in extra information and, in
learning theory, this corresponds to misclassification, or misprediction. In
this paper, we lay the foundations of a new theory that allows one to keep
control on the probability of change of compression (which maps into the
statistical "risk" in learning applications). Under suitable conditions, the
cardinality of the compressed set is shown to be a consistent estimator of the
probability of change of compression (without any upper limit on the size of
the compressed set); moreover, unprecedentedly tight finite-sample bounds to
evaluate the probability of change of compression are obtained under a
generally applicable condition of preference. All results are usable in a fully
agnostic setup, i.e., without requiring any a priori knowledge on the
probability distribution of the observations. Not only these results offer a
valid support to develop trust in observation-driven methodologies, they also
play a fundamental role in learning techniques as a tool for hyper-parameter

<p>Generalization is one of the main challenges of computational pathology.
Slide preparation heterogeneity and the diversity of scanners lead to poor
model performance when used on data from medical centers not seen during
training. In order to achieve stain invariance in breast invasive carcinoma
patch classification, we implement a stain translation strategy using cycleGANs
for unsupervised image-to-image translation. We compare three cycleGAN-based
approaches to a baseline classification model obtained without any stain
invariance strategy. Two of the proposed approaches use cycleGAN's translations
at inference or training in order to build stain-specific classification
models. The last method uses them for stain data augmentation during training.
This constrains the classification model to learn stain-invariant features.
Baseline metrics are set by training and testing the baseline classification
model on a reference stain. We assessed performances using three medical
centers with H&amp;E and H&amp;E&amp;S staining. Every approach tested in this study
improves baseline metrics without needing labels on target stains. The stain
augmentation-based approach produced the best results on every stain. Each
method's pros and cons are studied and discussed in this paper. However,
training highly performing cycleGANs models in itself represents a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a systematical method for optimizing cycleGAN
training by setting a novel stopping criterion. This method has the benefit of
not requiring any visual inspection of cycleGAN results and proves superiority
to methods using a predefined number of training epochs. In addition, we also
study the minimal amount of data required for cycleGAN training.

<p>Hard negative mining has shown effective in enhancing self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) on diverse data types, including graph CL (GCL). The
existing hardness-aware CL methods typically treat negative instances that are
most similar to the anchor instance as hard negatives, which helps improve the
CL performance, especially on image data. However, this approach often fails to
identify the hard negatives but leads to many false negatives on graph data.
This is mainly due to that the learned graph representations are not
sufficiently discriminative due to oversmooth representations and/or
non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) issues in graph data.
To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel approach that builds a
discriminative model on collective affinity information (i.e., two sets of
pairwise affinities between the negative instances and the anchor instance) to
mine hard negatives in GCL. In particular, the proposed approach evaluates how
confident/uncertain the discriminative model is about the affinity of each
negative instance to an anchor instance to determine its hardness weight
relative to the anchor instance. This uncertainty information is then
incorporated into the existing GCL loss functions via a weighting term to
enhance their performance. The enhanced GCL is theoretically grounded that the
resulting GCL loss is equivalent to a triplet loss with an adaptive margin
being exponentially proportional to the learned uncertainty of each negative
instance. Extensive experiments on ten graph datasets show that our approach
does the following: 1) consistently enhances different state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GCL methods in both graph and node classification tasks and 2) significantly
improves their robustness against adversarial attacks. Code is available at

<p>In practical compressed sensing (CS), the obtained measurements typically
necessitate quantization to a limited number of bits prior to transmission or
storage. This nonlinear quantization process poses significant recovery
challenges, particularly with extreme coarse quantization such as 1-bit.
Recently, an efficient algorithm called QCS-SGM was proposed for quantized CS
(QCS) which utilizes score-based generative models (SGM) as an implicit prior.
Due to the adeptness of SGM in capturing the intricate structures of natural
signals, QCS-SGM substantially outperforms previous QCS methods. However,
QCS-SGM is constrained to (approximately) row-orthogonal sensing matrices as
the computation of the likelihood score becomes intractable otherwise. To
address this limitation, we introduce an advanced variant of QCS-SGM, termed
QCS-SGM+, capable of handling general matrices effectively. The key idea is a
Bayesian inference perspective on the likelihood score computation, wherein
expectation propagation is employed for its approximate computation. Extensive
experiments are conducted, demonstrating the substantial superiority of
QCS-SGM+ over QCS-SGM for general sensing matrices beyond mere
row-orthogonality.

second-stage action from a feasible set that depends both on the first-stage
decision and the model parameter. We aim to minimize the cumulative objective
value while guaranteeing that the long-term average second-stage decision
belongs to a set. We develop online algorithms for the online two-stage problem
from adversarial learning algorithms. Also, the regret bound of our algorithm
cam be reduced to the regret bound of embedded adversarial learning algorithms.
Based on our framework, we obtain new results under various settings. When the
model parameter at each period is drawn from identical distributions, we derive
\textit{state-of-art} $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret that improves previous bounds under
special cases. Our algorithm is also robust to adversarial corruptions of model
parameter realizations. When the model parameters are drawn from unknown
non-stationary distributions and we are given machine-learned predictions of
the distributions, we develop a new algorithm from our framework with a regret
$O(W_T+\sqrt{T})$, where $W_T$ measures the total inaccuracy of the
machine-learned predictions.

<p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) pipelines differ in many design choices such
as the architecture, augmentations, or pretraining data. Yet SSL is typically
evaluated using a single metric: linear probing on ImageNet. This does not
provide much insight into why or when a model is better, now how to improve it.
To address this, we propose an SSL risk decomposition, which generalizes the
classical supervised approximation-estimation decomposition by considering
errors arising from the representation learning step. Our decomposition
consists of four error components: approximation, representation usability,
probe generalization, and encoder generalization. We provide efficient
estimators for each component and use them to analyze the effect of 30 design
choices on 169 SSL vision models evaluated on ImageNet. Our analysis gives
valuable insights for designing and using SSL models. For example, it
highlights the main sources of error and shows how to improve SSL in specific
settings (full- vs few-shot) by trading off error components. All results and
pretrained models are at https://github.com/YannDubs/SSL-Risk-Decomposition.

<p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in learning and explaining causal
effects within Neural Network (NN) models. By virtue of NN architectures,
previous approaches consider only direct and total causal effects assuming
independence among input variables. We view an NN as a structural causal model
(SCM) and extend our focus to include indirect causal effects by introducing
feedforward connections among input neurons. We propose an ante-hoc method that
captures and maintains direct, indirect, and total causal effects during NN
model training. We also propose an algorithm for quantifying learned causal
effects in an NN model and efficient approximation strategies for quantifying
causal effects in high-dimensional data. Extensive experiments conducted on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the causal effects learned
by our ante-hoc method better approximate the ground truth effects compared to
existing methods.

<p>Due to mutual interference between users, power allocation problems in
wireless networks are often non-convex and computationally challenging. Graph
neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach to
tackling these problems and an approach that exploits the underlying topology
of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel graph representation
method for wireless networks that include full-duplex (FD) nodes. We then
design a corresponding FD Graph Neural Network (F-GNN) with the aim of
allocating transmit powers to maximise the network throughput. Our results show
that our F-GNN achieves state-of-art performance with significantly less
computation time. Besides, F-GNN offers an excellent trade-off between
performance and complexity compared to classical approaches. We further refine
this trade-off by introducing a distance-based threshold for inclusion or
exclusion of edges in the network. We show that an appropriately chosen
threshold reduces required training time by roughly 20% with a relatively minor
loss in performance.

<p>Numerical interactions leading to users sharing textual content published by
others are naturally represented by a network where the individuals are
associated with the nodes and the exchanged texts with the edges. To understand
those heterogeneous and complex data structures, clustering nodes into
homogeneous groups as well as rendering a comprehensible visualisation of the
data is mandatory. To address both issues, we introduce Deep-LPTM, a
model-based clustering strategy relying on a variational graph auto-encoder
approach as well as a probabilistic model to characterise the topics of
discussion. Deep-LPTM allows to build a joint representation of the nodes and
of the edges in two embeddings spaces. The parameters are inferred using a
variational inference algorithm. We also introduce IC2L, a model selection
criterion specifically designed to choose models with relevant clustering and
visualisation properties. An extensive benchmark study on synthetic data is
provided. In particular, we find that Deep-LPTM better recovers the partitions
of the nodes than the state-of-the art ETSBM and STBM. Eventually, the emails

<p>Machine learning tasks over image databases often generate masks that
annotate image content (e.g., saliency maps, segmentation maps, depth maps) and
enable a variety of applications (e.g., determine if a model is learning
spurious correlations or if an image was maliciously modified to mislead a
model). While queries that retrieve examples based on mask properties are
valuable to practitioners, existing systems do not support them efficiently. In
this paper, we formalize the problem and propose MaskSearch, a system that
focuses on accelerating queries over databases of image masks while
guaranteeing the correctness of query results. MaskSearch leverages a novel
indexing technique and an efficient filter-verification query execution
framework. Experiments with our prototype show that MaskSearch, using indexes
approximately 5% of the compressed data size, accelerates individual queries by
up to two orders of magnitude and consistently outperforms existing methods on

(EDR) of a large class of kernel functions defined on a general domain rather
than $\mathbb S^{d}$. This class of kernel functions include but are not
limited to the neural tangent kernel associated with neural networks with
different depths and various activation functions. After proving that the
dynamics of training the wide neural networks uniformly approximated that of
the neural tangent kernel regression on general domains, we can further
illustrate the minimax optimality of the wide neural network provided that the
underground truth function $f\in [\mathcal H_{\mathrm{NTK}}]^{s}$, an

<p>The prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) has envisioned an era of
healthcare democratisation that promises every stakeholder a new and better way
of life. However, the advancement of clinical AI research is significantly
hurdled by the dearth of data democratisation in healthcare. To truly
democratise data for AI studies, challenges are two-fold: 1. the sensitive
information in clinical data should be anonymised appropriately, and 2.
AI-oriented clinical knowledge should flow freely across organisations. This
paper considers a recent deep-learning advent, dataset condensation (DC), as a
stone that kills two birds in democratising healthcare data. The condensed data
after DC, which can be viewed as statistical metadata, abstracts original
clinical records and irreversibly conceals sensitive information at individual
levels; nevertheless, it still preserves adequate knowledge for learning deep
neural networks (DNNs). More favourably, the compressed volumes and the
accelerated model learnings of condensed data portray a more efficient clinical
knowledge sharing and flowing system, as necessitated by data democratisation.
We underline DC's prospects for democratising clinical data, specifically
electrical healthcare records (EHRs), for AI research through experimental
results and analysis across three healthcare datasets of varying data types.

<p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning and neural network scaling have
enabled the creation of large models, known as foundation models, which can be
easily adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. The current paradigm for
comparing foundation models involves evaluating them with aggregate metrics on
various benchmark datasets. This method of model comparison is heavily
dependent on the chosen evaluation metric, which makes it unsuitable for
situations where the ideal metric is either not obvious or unavailable. In this
work, we present a methodology for directly comparing the embedding space
geometry of foundation models, which facilitates model comparison without the
need for an explicit evaluation metric. Our methodology is grounded in random
graph theory and enables valid hypothesis testing of embedding similarity on a
per-datum basis. Further, we demonstrate how our methodology can be extended to
facilitate population level model comparison. In particular, we show how our
framework can induce a manifold of models equipped with a distance function
that correlates strongly with several downstream metrics. We remark on the
utility of this population level model comparison as a first step towards a
taxonomic science of foundation models.

<p>Viewing Transformers as interacting particle systems, we describe the
geometry of learned representations when the weights are not time dependent. We
show that particles, representing tokens, tend to cluster toward particular
limiting objects as time tends to infinity. Cluster locations are determined by
the initial tokens, confirming context-awareness of representations learned by
Transformers. Using techniques from dynamical systems and partial differential
equations, we show that the type of limiting object that emerges depends on the
spectrum of the value matrix. Additionally, in the one-dimensional case we
prove that the self-attention matrix converges to a low-rank Boolean matrix.
The combination of these results mathematically confirms the empirical
observation made by Vaswani et al. [VSP'17] that leaders appear in a sequence
of tokens when processed by Transformers.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have seen widespread adoption
due to their strong instruction-following abilities. Developing these LLMs
involves a complex yet poorly understood workflow requiring training with human
feedback. Replicating and understanding this instruction-following requires
tackling three major challenges: the high cost of data collection, the lack of
trustworthy evaluation, and the absence of reference method implementations. We
address these challenges with AlpacaFarm, a simulator that enables research and
development for learning from feedback at a low cost. First, we design LLM
prompts to simulate human feedback that are 50x cheaper than crowdworkers and
display high agreement with humans. Second, we propose an automatic evaluation
and validate it against human instructions obtained on real-world interactions.
Third, we contribute reference implementations for several methods (PPO, DPO,
best-of-n, expert iteration, and more) that learn from pairwise feedback.
Finally, as an end-to-end validation of AlpacaFarm, we train and evaluate
eleven models on 10k pairs of real human feedback and show that rankings of
models trained in AlpacaFarm match rankings of models trained on human data. As
a demonstration of the research possible in AlpacaFarm, we find that methods
that use a reward model can substantially improve over supervised fine-tuning
and that our reference PPO implementation leads to a +10% improvement in
win-rate against Davinci003. We release all components of AlpacaFarm at

<p>Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is a technique used to identify abnormal nodes
within graphs, finding applications in network security, fraud detection,
social media spam detection, and various other domains. A common method for GAD
is Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs), which encode graph data into node
representations and identify anomalies by assessing the reconstruction quality
of the graphs based on these representations. However, existing GAE models are
primarily optimized for direct link reconstruction, resulting in nodes
connected in the graph being clustered in the latent space. As a result, they
excel at detecting cluster-type structural anomalies but struggle with more
complex structural anomalies that do not conform to clusters. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel solution called GAD-NR, a new variant of GAE
that incorporates neighborhood reconstruction for graph anomaly detection.
GAD-NR aims to reconstruct the entire neighborhood of a node, encompassing the
local structure, self-attributes, and neighbor attributes, based on the
corresponding node representation. By comparing the neighborhood reconstruction
loss between anomalous nodes and normal nodes, GAD-NR can effectively detect
any anomalies. Extensive experimentation conducted on six real-world datasets
validates the effectiveness of GAD-NR, showcasing significant improvements (by
up to 30% in AUC) over state-of-the-art competitors. The source code for GAD-NR
is openly available. Importantly, the comparative analysis reveals that the
existing methods perform well only in detecting one or two types of anomalies
out of the three types studied. In contrast, GAD-NR excels at detecting all
three types of anomalies across the datasets, demonstrating its comprehensive
anomaly detection capabilities.

<p>The success of reinforcement learning (RL) crucially depends on effective
function approximation when dealing with complex ground-truth models. Existing
sample-efficient RL algorithms primarily employ three approaches to function
approximation: policy-based, value-based, and model-based methods. However, in
the face of model misspecification (a disparity between the ground-truth and
optimal function approximators), it is shown that policy-based approaches can
be robust even when the policy function approximation is under a large
locally-bounded misspecification error, with which the function class may
exhibit a $\Omega(1)$ approximation error in specific states and actions, but
remains small on average within a policy-induced state distribution. Yet it
remains an open question whether similar robustness can be achieved with
value-based and model-based approaches, especially with general function
approximation.
</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, in this paper we present a unified theoretical framework
for addressing model misspecification in RL. We demonstrate that, through
meticulous algorithm design and sophisticated analysis, value-based and
model-based methods employing general function approximation can achieve
robustness under local misspecification error bounds. In particular, they can
attain a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(\text{poly}(d H)(\sqrt{K} +
K\zeta) \right)$, where $d$ represents the complexity of the function class,
$H$ is the episode length, $K$ is the total number of episodes, and $\zeta$
denotes the local bound for misspecification error. Furthermore, we propose an
algorithmic framework that can achieve the same order of regret bound without
prior knowledge of $\zeta$, thereby enhancing its practical applicability.

<p>The research on embodied AI has greatly promoted the development of robot
manipulation. However, it still faces significant challenges in various aspects
such as benchmark construction, multi-modal perception and decision-making, and
physical execution. Previous robot manipulation simulators were primarily
designed to enrich manipulation types and types of objects while neglecting the
balance between physical manipulation and language instruction complexity in
multi-modal environments. This paper proposes a new robot manipulation
simulator and builds a comprehensive and systematic robot manipulation
benchmark with progressive reasoning tasks called SeaWave (i.e., a progressive
reasoning benchmark). It provides a standard test platform for embedded AI
agents in a multi-modal environment, which can evaluate and execute four levels
of human natural language instructions at the same time.
</p>
<p>Previous world model-based robot manipulation work lacked research on the
perception and decision-making of complex instructions in multi-modal
environments. To this end, we propose a new world model tailored for
cross-modal robot manipulation called DamWorld. Specifically, DamWorld takes
the current visual scene and predicted execution actions based on natural
language instructions as input, and uses the next action frame to supervise the
output of the world model to force the model to learn robot manipulation
consistent with world knowledge. Compared with the renowned baselines (e.g.,
RT-1), our DamWorld improves the manipulation success rate by 5.6% on average
on four levels of progressive reasoning tasks. It is worth noting that on the
most challenging level 4 manipulation task, DamWorld still improved by 9.0%
compared to prior works.

<p>Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods such as RL$^2$ have emerged as
promising approaches for learning data-efficient RL algorithms tailored to a
given task distribution. However, these RL algorithms struggle with
long-horizon tasks and out-of-distribution tasks since they rely on recurrent
neural networks to process the sequence of experiences instead of summarizing
them into general RL components such as value functions. Moreover, even
transformers have a practical limit to the length of histories they can
efficiently reason about before training and inference costs become
prohibitive. In contrast, traditional RL algorithms are data-inefficient since
they do not leverage domain knowledge, but they do converge to an optimal
policy as more data becomes available. In this paper, we propose RL$^3$, a
principled hybrid approach that combines traditional RL and meta-RL by
incorporating task-specific action-values learned through traditional RL as an
input to the meta-RL neural network. We show that RL$^3$ earns greater
cumulative reward on long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks compared to
RL$^2$, while maintaining the efficiency of the latter in the short term.
Experiments are conducted on both custom and benchmark discrete domains from
the meta-RL literature that exhibit a range of short-term, long-term, and
complex dependencies.

<p>The streaming model is an abstraction of computing over massive data streams,
which is a popular way of dealing with large-scale modern data analysis. In
this model, there is a stream of data points, one after the other. A streaming
algorithm is only allowed one pass over the data stream, and the goal is to
perform some analysis during the stream while using as small space as possible.
Clustering problems (such as $k$-means and $k$-median) are fundamental
unsupervised machine learning primitives, and streaming clustering algorithms
have been extensively studied in the past. However, since data privacy becomes
a central concern in many real-world applications, non-private clustering
algorithms are not applicable in many scenarios.
</p>
<p>In this work, we provide the first differentially private streaming
algorithms for $k$-means and $k$-median clustering of $d$-dimensional Euclidean
data points over a stream with length at most $T$ using $poly(k,d,\log(T))$
space to achieve a constant multiplicative error and a $poly(k,d,\log(T))$
additive error. In particular, we present a differentially private streaming
clustering framework which only requires an offline DP coreset or clustering
algorithm as a blackbox. By plugging in existing results from DP clustering
Ghazi, Kumar, Manurangsi 2020 and Kaplan, Stemmer 2018, we achieve (1) a
$(1+\gamma)$-multiplicative approximation with
$\tilde{O}_\gamma(poly(k,d,\log(T)))$ space for any $\gamma&gt;0$, and the
additive error is $poly(k,d,\log(T))$ or (2) an $O(1)$-multiplicative
approximation with $\tilde{O}(k^{1.5} \cdot poly(d,\log(T)))$ space and
$poly(k,d,\log(T))$ additive error. In addition, our algorithmic framework is
also differentially private under the continual release setting, i.e., the
union of outputs of our algorithms at every timestamp is always differentially
private.

<p>In many medical image classification problems, labeled data is scarce while
unlabeled data is more available. Semi-supervised learning and self-supervised
learning are two different research directions that can improve accuracy by
learning from extra unlabeled data. Recent methods from both directions have
reported significant gains on traditional benchmarks. Yet past benchmarks do
not focus on medical tasks and rarely compare self- and semi- methods together
on equal footing. Furthermore, past benchmarks often handle hyperparameter
tuning suboptimally. First, they may not tune hyperparameters at all, leading
to underfitting. Second, when tuning does occur, it often unrealistically uses
a labeled validation set much larger than the train set. Both cases make
previously published rankings of methods difficult to translate to practical
settings. This study contributes a systematic evaluation of self- and semi-
methods with a unified experimental protocol intended to guide a practitioner
with scarce overall labeled data and a limited compute budget. We answer two
key questions: Can hyperparameter tuning be effective with realistic-sized
validation sets? If so, when all methods are tuned well, which self- or
semi-supervised methods reach the best accuracy? Our study compares 13
representative semi- and self-supervised methods to strong labeled-set-only
baselines on 4 medical datasets. From 20000+ total GPU hours of computation, we
provide valuable best practices to resource-constrained, results-focused
practitioners.

<p>We present the Multi-Modal Discussion Transformer (mDT), a novel methodfor
detecting hate speech in online social networks such as Reddit discussions. In
contrast to traditional comment-only methods, our approach to labelling a
comment as hate speech involves a holistic analysis of text and images grounded
in the discussion context. This is done by leveraging graph transformers to
capture the contextual relationships in the discussion surrounding a comment
and grounding the interwoven fusion layers that combine text and image
embeddings instead of processing modalities separately. To evaluate our work,
we present a new dataset, HatefulDiscussions, comprising complete multi-modal
discussions from multiple online communities on Reddit. We compare the
performance of our model to baselines that only process individual comments and
conduct extensive ablation studies.

<p>Equipping a deep model the abaility of few-shot learning, i.e., learning
quickly from only few examples, is a core challenge for artificial
intelligence. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches effectively address the
challenge by learning how to learn novel tasks. Its key idea is learning a deep
model in a bi-level optimization manner, where the outer-loop process learns a
shared gradient descent algorithm (i.e., its hyperparameters), while the
inner-loop process leverage it to optimize a task-specific model by using only
few labeled data. Although these existing methods have shown superior
performance, the outer-loop process requires calculating second-order
derivatives along the inner optimization path, which imposes considerable
memory burdens and the risk of vanishing gradients. Drawing inspiration from
recent progress of diffusion models, we find that the inner-loop gradient
descent process can be actually viewed as a reverse process (i.e., denoising)
of diffusion where the target of denoising is model weights but the origin
data. Based on this fact, in this paper, we propose to model the gradient
descent optimizer as a diffusion model and then present a novel
task-conditional diffusion-based meta-learning, called MetaDiff, that
effectively models the optimization process of model weights from Gaussion
noises to target weights in a denoising manner. Thanks to the training
efficiency of diffusion models, our MetaDiff do not need to differentiate
through the inner-loop path such that the memory burdens and the risk of
vanishing gradients can be effectvely alleviated. Experiment results show that
our MetaDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning
family in few-shot learning tasks.

<p>While a practical wireless network has many tiers where end users do not
directly communicate with the central server, the users' devices have limited
computation and battery powers, and the serving base station (BS) has a fixed
bandwidth. Owing to these practical constraints and system models, this paper
leverages model pruning and proposes a pruning-enabled hierarchical federated
learning (PHFL) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We first derive an upper
bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model
pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS.
Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU)
frequency and transmission power of the clients in order to minimize the
controllable terms of the convergence bound under strict delay and energy
constraints. However, since the original problem is not convex, we perform
successive convex approximation (SCA) and jointly optimize the parameters for
the relaxed convex problem. Through extensive simulation, we validate the
effectiveness of our proposed PHFL algorithm in terms of test accuracy, wall
clock time, energy consumption and bandwidth requirement.

<p>Personalized recommendations form an important part of today's internet
ecosystem, helping artists and creators to reach interested users, and helping
users to discover new and engaging content. However, many users today are
skeptical of platforms that personalize recommendations, in part due to
historically careless treatment of personal data and data privacy. Now,
businesses that rely on personalized recommendations are entering a new
paradigm, where many of their systems must be overhauled to be privacy-first.
In this article, we propose an algorithm for personalized recommendations that
facilitates both precise and differentially-private measurement. We consider
advertising as an example application, and conduct offline experiments to
quantify how the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm affects key metrics
related to user experience, advertiser value, and platform revenue compared to
the extremes of both (private) non-personalized and non-private, personalized
implementations.

<p>Calorimeter shower simulation is a major bottleneck in the Large Hadron
Collider computational pipeline. There have been recent efforts to employ
deep-generative surrogate models to overcome this challenge. However, many of
best performing models have training and generation times that do not scale
well to high-dimensional calorimeter showers. In this work, we introduce
SuperCalo, a flow-based super-resolution model, and demonstrate that
high-dimensional fine-grained calorimeter showers can be quickly upsampled from
coarse-grained showers. This novel approach presents a way to reduce
computational cost, memory requirements and generation time associated with
fast calorimeter simulation models. Additionally, we show that the showers
upsampled by SuperCalo possess a high degree of variation. This allows a large
number of high-dimensional calorimeter showers to be upsampled from much fewer
coarse showers with high-fidelity, which results in additional reduction in
generation time.

<p>Multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant popularity in recommender
systems as it enables simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. A key
challenge in MTL is negative transfer, but existing studies explored negative
transfer on all samples, overlooking the inherent complexities within them. We
split the samples according to the relative amount of positive feedback among
tasks. Surprisingly, negative transfer still occurs in existing MTL methods on
samples that receive comparable feedback across tasks. Existing work commonly
employs a shared-embedding paradigm, limiting the ability of modeling diverse
user preferences on different tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel Shared
and Task-specific EMbeddings (STEM) paradigm that aims to incorporate both
shared and task-specific embeddings to effectively capture task-specific user
preferences. Under this paradigm, we propose a simple model STEM-Net, which is
equipped with an All Forward Task-specific Backward gating network to
facilitate the learning of task-specific embeddings and direct knowledge
transfer across tasks. Remarkably, STEM-Net demonstrates exceptional
performance on comparable samples, achieving positive transfer. Comprehensive
evaluation on three public MTL recommendation datasets demonstrates that
STEM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models by a substantial margin. Our code

<p>Scientific machine learning for inferring dynamical systems combines
data-driven modeling, physics-based modeling, and empirical knowledge. It plays
an essential role in engineering design and digital twinning. In this work, we
primarily focus on an operator inference methodology that builds dynamical
models, preferably in low-dimension, with a prior hypothesis on the model
structure, often determined by known physics or given by experts. Then, for
inference, we aim to learn the operators of a model by setting up an
appropriate optimization problem. One of the critical properties of dynamical
systems is stability. However, this property is not guaranteed by the inferred
models. In this work, we propose inference formulations to learn quadratic
models, which are stable by design. Precisely, we discuss the parameterization
of quadratic systems that are locally and globally stable. Moreover, for
quadratic systems with no stable point yet bounded (e.g., chaotic Lorenz
model), we discuss how to parameterize such bounded behaviors in the learning
process. Using those parameterizations, we set up inference problems, which are
then solved using a gradient-based optimization method. Furthermore, to avoid
numerical derivatives and still learn continuous systems, we make use of an
integral form of differential equations. We present several numerical examples,
illustrating the preservation of stability and discussing its comparison with
the existing state-of-the-art approach to infer operators. By means of
numerical examples, we also demonstrate how the proposed methods are employed
to discover governing equations and energy-preserving models.

analysis through the application of prompting strategies. We formulate the
process of prompting for sentiment analysis tasks and introduce two novel
strategies tailored for sentiment analysis: RolePlaying (RP) prompting and

<p>We present a data-driven model for ground-motion synthesis using a Generative
Adversarial Neural Operator (GANO) that combines recent advancements in machine
learning and open access strong motion data sets to generate three-component
acceleration time histories conditioned on moment magnitude ($M$), rupture
distance ($R_{rup}$), time-average shear-wave velocity at the top $30m$
($V_{S30}$), and tectonic environment or style of faulting. We use Neural
Operators, a resolution invariant architecture that guarantees that the model
training is independent of the data sampling frequency. We first present the
conditional ground-motion synthesis algorithm (referred to heretofore as
cGM-GANO) and discuss its advantages compared to previous work. Next, we verify
the cGM-GANO framework using simulated ground motions generated with the
Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP). We
lastly train cGM-GANO on a KiK-net dataset from Japan, showing that the
framework can recover the magnitude, distance, and $V_{S30}$ scaling of Fourier
amplitude and pseudo-spectral accelerations. We evaluate cGM-GANO through
residual analysis with the empirical dataset as well as by comparison with
conventional Ground Motion Models (GMMs) for selected ground motion scenarios.
Results show that cGM-GANO produces consistent median scaling with the GMMs for
the corresponding tectonic environments. The largest misfit is observed at
short distances due to the scarcity of training data. With the exception of
short distances, the aleatory variability of the response spectral ordinates is
also well captured, especially for subduction events due to the adequacy of
training data. Applications of the presented framework include generation of
risk-targeted ground motions for site-specific engineering applications.

<p>We study monotone submodular maximization under general matroid constraints
in the online setting. We prove that online optimization of a large class of
submodular functions, namely, weighted threshold potential functions, reduces
to online convex optimization (OCO). This is precisely because functions in
this class admit a concave relaxation; as a result, OCO policies, coupled with
an appropriate rounding scheme, can be used to achieve sublinear regret in the
combinatorial setting. We show that our reduction extends to many different
versions of the online learning problem, including the dynamic regret, bandit,

model is adapted from a speech foundation model trained on a large quantity of
supervised and unsupervised data, demonstrating the utility of fine-tuning from
a large generic foundation model for a downstream task. We analyze the
performance of this multilingual speaker change detection model through a
series of ablation studies. We show that the USM-SCD model can achieve more
than 75% average speaker change detection F1 score across a test set that
consists of data from 96 languages. On American English, the USM-SCD model can
achieve an 85.8% speaker change detection F1 score across various public and
internal test sets, beating the previous monolingual baseline model by 21%
relative. We also show that we only need to fine-tune one-quarter of the
trainable model parameters to achieve the best model performance. The USM-SCD
model exhibits state-of-the-art ASR quality compared with a strong public ASR
baseline, making it suitable to handle both tasks with negligible additional
computational cost.

<p>We develop a general theory to optimize the frequentist regret for sequential
learning problems, where efficient bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms
can be derived from unified Bayesian principles. We propose a novel
optimization approach to generate "algorithmic beliefs" at each round, and use
Bayesian posteriors to make decisions. The optimization objective to create
"algorithmic beliefs," which we term "Algorithmic Information Ratio,"
represents an intrinsic complexity measure that effectively characterizes the
frequentist regret of any algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first systematical approach to make Bayesian-type algorithms prior-free and
applicable to adversarial settings, in a generic and optimal manner. Moreover,
the algorithms are simple and often efficient to implement. As a major
application, we present a novel algorithm for multi-armed bandits that achieves
the "best-of-all-worlds" empirical performance in the stochastic, adversarial,
and non-stationary environments. And we illustrate how these principles can be
used in linear bandits, bandit convex optimization, and reinforcement learning.

<p>Training differentially private machine learning models requires constraining
an individual's contribution to the optimization process. This is achieved by
clipping the $2$-norm of their gradient at a predetermined threshold prior to
averaging and batch sanitization. This selection adversely influences
optimization in two opposing ways: it either exacerbates the bias due to
excessive clipping at lower values, or augments sanitization noise at higher
values. The choice significantly hinges on factors such as the dataset, model
architecture, and even varies within the same optimization, demanding
meticulous tuning usually accomplished through a grid search. In order to
circumvent the privacy expenses incurred in hyperparameter tuning, we present a
novel approach to dynamically optimize the clipping threshold. We treat this
threshold as an additional learnable parameter, establishing a clean
relationship between the threshold and the cost function. This allows us to
optimize the former with gradient descent, with minimal repercussions on the
overall privacy analysis. Our method is thoroughly assessed against alternative
fixed and adaptive strategies across diverse datasets, tasks, model dimensions,
and privacy levels. Our results indicate that it performs comparably or better
in the evaluated scenarios, given the same privacy requirements.

<p>The in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs) enables them
to generalize to novel downstream tasks with relatively few labeled examples.
However, they require enormous computational resources to be deployed.
Alternatively, smaller models can solve specific tasks if fine-tuned with
enough labeled examples. These examples, however, are expensive to obtain. In
pursuit of the best of both worlds, we study synthetic data generation of
fine-tuning training data via fine-tuned teacher LLMs to improve the downstream
performance of much smaller models. In four text classification and two text
generation tasks, we find that both data generation and annotation dramatically
improve the respective downstream model's performance, occasionally
necessitating only a minor fraction of the original training dataset.

<p>Memory constraint of always-on devices is one of the major concerns when
deploying speech processing models on these devices. While larger models
trained with sufficiently large amount of data generally perform better, making
them fit in the device memory is a demanding challenge. In this paper, we aim
to reduce model size by reparameterizing model weights across Transformer
encoder layers and assuming a special weight composition and structure. More
specifically, inspired by ResNet and the more recent LoRA work, we propose an
approach named ResidualTransformer, where each weight matrix in a Transformer
layer comprises 1) a shared full-rank component with its adjacent layers, and
2) a unique low-rank component to itself. The low-rank matrices only account
for a small amount of model size increase. In addition, we add diagonal weight
matrices to improve modeling capacity of the low-rank matrices. Experiments of
our 10k-hour speech recognition and speech translation tasks show that the
Transformer encoder size can be reduced by ~3X with very slight performance
degradation.

<p>Analyzing, understanding, and describing human behavior is advantageous in
different settings, such as web browsing or traffic navigation. Understanding
human behavior naturally helps to improve and optimize the underlying
infrastructure or user interfaces. Typically, human navigation is represented
by sequences of transitions between states. Previous work suggests to use
hypotheses, representing different intuitions about the navigation to analyze
these transitions. To mathematically grasp this setting, first-order Markov
chains are used to capture the behavior, consequently allowing to apply
different kinds of graph comparisons, but comes with the inherent drawback of
losing information about higher-order dependencies within the sequences. To
this end, we propose to analyze entire sequences using autoregressive language
models, as they are traditionally used to model higher-order dependencies in
sequences. We show that our approach can be easily adapted to model different
settings introduced in previous work, namely HypTrails, MixedTrails and even
SubTrails, while at the same time bringing unique advantages: 1. Modeling
higher-order dependencies between state transitions, while 2. being able to
identify short comings in proposed hypotheses, and 3. naturally introducing a
unified approach to model all settings. To show the expressiveness of our
approach, we evaluate our approach on different synthetic datasets and conclude
with an exemplary analysis of a real-world dataset, examining the behavior of

<p>Covariate shift in the test data is a common practical phenomena that can
significantly downgrade both the accuracy and the fairness performance of the
model. Ensuring fairness across different sensitive groups under covariate
shift is of paramount importance due to societal implications like criminal
justice. We operate in the unsupervised regime where only a small set of
unlabeled test samples along with a labeled training set is available. Towards
improving fairness under this highly challenging yet realistic scenario, we
make three contributions. First is a novel composite weighted entropy based
objective for prediction accuracy which is optimized along with a
representation matching loss for fairness. We experimentally verify that
optimizing with our loss formulation outperforms a number of state-of-the-art
baselines in the pareto sense with respect to the fairness-accuracy tradeoff on
several standard datasets. Our second contribution is a new setting we term
Asymmetric Covariate Shift that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been
studied before. Asymmetric covariate shift occurs when distribution of
covariates of one group shifts significantly compared to the other groups and
this happens when a dominant group is over-represented. While this setting is
extremely challenging for current baselines, We show that our proposed method
significantly outperforms them. Our third contribution is theoretical, where we
show that our weighted entropy term along with prediction loss on the training
set approximates test loss under covariate shift. Empirically and through
formal sample complexity bounds, we show that this approximation to the unseen
test loss does not depend on importance sampling variance which affects many
other baselines.

<p>In recent years, multi-objective optimization (MOO) emerges as a foundational
problem underpinning many multi-agent multi-task learning applications.
However, existing algorithms in MOO literature remain limited to centralized
learning settings, which do not satisfy the distributed nature and data privacy
needs of such multi-agent multi-task learning applications. This motivates us
to propose a new federated multi-objective learning (FMOL) framework with
multiple clients distributively and collaboratively solving an MOO problem
while keeping their training data private. Notably, our FMOL framework allows a
different set of objective functions across different clients to support a wide
range of applications, which advances and generalizes the MOO formulation to
the federated learning paradigm for the first time. For this FMOL framework, we
propose two new federated multi-objective optimization (FMOO) algorithms called
federated multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) and federated stochastic
multi-gradient descent averaging (FSMGDA). Both algorithms allow local updates
to significantly reduce communication costs, while achieving the {\em same}
convergence rates as those of their algorithmic counterparts in the
single-objective federated learning. Our extensive experiments also corroborate
the efficacy of our proposed FMOO algorithms.

<p>The ability to derive useful information by asking clarifying questions (ACQ)
is an important element of real life collaboration on reasoning tasks, such as
question answering (QA). Existing natural language ACQ challenges, however,
evaluate generations based on word overlap rather than the value of the
information itself. Word overlap is often an inappropriate metric for question
generation since many different questions could be useful in a given situation,
and a single question can be phrased many different ways. Instead, we propose
evaluating questions pragmatically based on the value of the information they
retrieve. Here we present a definition and framework for natural language
pragmatic asking of clarifying questions (PACQ), the problem of generating
questions that result in answers useful for a reasoning task. We also present
fact-level masking (FLM), a procedure for converting natural language datasets
into self-supervised PACQ datasets by omitting particular critical facts.
Finally, we generate a PACQ dataset from the HotpotQA dataset using FLM and
evaluate several zero-shot language models on it. Our experiments show that
current zero-shot models struggle to ask questions that retrieve useful
information, as compared to human annotators. These results demonstrate an
opportunity to use FLM datasets and the PACQ framework to objectively evaluate
and improve question generation and other language models.

<p>We reformulate the problem of supervised learning as learning to learn with
two nested loops (i.e. learning problems). The inner loop learns on each
individual instance with self-supervision before final prediction. The outer
loop learns the self-supervised task used by the inner loop, such that its
final prediction improves. Our inner loop turns out to be equivalent to linear
attention when the inner-loop learner is only a linear model, and to
self-attention when it is a kernel estimator. For practical comparison with
linear or self-attention layers, we replace each of them in a transformer with
an inner loop, so our outer loop is equivalent to training the architecture.
When each inner-loop learner is a neural network, our approach vastly
outperforms transformers with linear attention on ImageNet from 224 x 224 raw
pixels in both accuracy and FLOPs, while (regular) transformers cannot run.

<p>Although the mapping between sound and meaning in human language is assumed
to be largely arbitrary, research in cognitive science has shown that there are
non-trivial correlations between particular sounds and meanings across
languages and demographic groups, a phenomenon known as sound symbolism. Among
the many dimensions of meaning, sound symbolism is particularly salient and
well-demonstrated with regards to cross-modal associations between language and
the visual domain. In this work, we address the question of whether sound
symbolism is reflected in vision-and-language models such as CLIP and Stable
Diffusion. Using zero-shot knowledge probing to investigate the inherent
knowledge of these models, we find strong evidence that they do show this
pattern, paralleling the well-known kiki-bouba effect in psycholinguistics. Our

<p>Recently, image-text matching has attracted more and more attention from
academia and industry, which is fundamental to understanding the latent
correspondence across visual and textual modalities. However, most existing
methods implicitly assume the training pairs are well-aligned while ignoring
the ubiquitous annotation noise, a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC), thereby
inevitably leading to a performance drop. Although some methods attempt to
address such noise, they still face two challenging problems: excessive
memorizing/overfitting and unreliable correction for NC, especially under high
noise. To address the two problems, we propose a generalized Cross-modal Robust
Complementary Learning framework (CRCL), which benefits from a novel Active
Complementary Loss (ACL) and an efficient Self-refining Correspondence
Correction (SCC) to improve the robustness of existing methods. Specifically,
ACL exploits active and complementary learning losses to reduce the risk of
providing erroneous supervision, leading to theoretically and experimentally
demonstrated robustness against NC. SCC utilizes multiple self-refining
processes with momentum correction to enlarge the receptive field for
correcting correspondences, thereby alleviating error accumulation and
achieving accurate and stable corrections. We carry out extensive experiments
on three image-text benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and CC152K, to verify
the superior robustness of our CRCL against synthetic and real-world noisy

<p>Synthetic data generation, a cornerstone of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GAI), signifies a paradigm shift in data science by addressing
data scarcity and privacy while enabling unprecedented performance. As
synthetic data gains prominence, questions arise concerning the accuracy of
statistical methods when applied to synthetic data compared to raw data. This
article introduces the Synthetic Data Generation for Analytics (Syn) framework.
This framework employs statistical methods on high-fidelity synthetic data
generated by advanced models such as tabular diffusion and Generative
Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. These models, trained on raw data, are
further enhanced with insights from pertinent studies through knowledge
transfer. A significant discovery within this framework is the generational
effect: the error of a statistical method on synthetic data initially
diminishes with additional synthetic data but may eventually increase or
plateau. This phenomenon, rooted in the complexities of replicating raw data
distributions, highlights a "reflection point" - an optimal threshold in the
size of synthetic data determined by specific error metrics. Through three case
studies - sentiment analysis of texts, predictive modeling of structured data,
and inference in tabular data - we demonstrate the effectiveness of this
framework over traditional ones. We underline its potential to amplify various
statistical methods, including gradient boosting for prediction and hypothesis
testing, thereby underscoring the transformative potential of synthetic data
generation in data science.

<p>Recent years have witnessed growing concerns about the privacy of sensitive
data. In response to these concerns, differential privacy has emerged as a
rigorous framework for privacy protection, gaining widespread recognition in
both academic and industrial circles. While substantial progress has been made
in private data analysis, existing methods often suffer from impracticality or
a significant loss of statistical efficiency. This paper aims to alleviate
these concerns in the context of hypothesis testing by introducing
differentially private permutation tests. The proposed framework extends
classical non-private permutation tests to private settings, maintaining both
finite-sample validity and differential privacy in a rigorous manner. The power
of the proposed test depends on the choice of a test statistic, and we
establish general conditions for consistency and non-asymptotic uniform power.
To demonstrate the utility and practicality of our framework, we focus on
reproducing kernel-based test statistics and introduce differentially private
kernel tests for two-sample and independence testing: dpMMD and dpHSIC. The
proposed kernel tests are straightforward to implement, applicable to various
types of data, and attain minimax optimal power across different privacy
regimes. Our empirical evaluations further highlight their competitive power
under various synthetic and real-world scenarios, emphasizing their practical
value. The code is publicly available to facilitate the implementation of our

<p>Due to the expanding scope of machine learning (ML) to the fields of sensor
networking, cooperative robotics and many other multi-agent systems,
distributed deployment of inference algorithms has received a lot of attention.
These algorithms involve collaboratively learning unknown parameters from
dispersed data collected by multiple agents. There are two competing aspects in
such algorithms, namely, intra-agent computation and inter-agent communication.
Traditionally, algorithms are designed to perform both synchronously. However,
certain circumstances need frugal use of communication channels as they are
either unreliable, time-consuming, or resource-expensive. In this paper, we
propose gossip-based asynchronous communication to leverage fast computations
and reduce communication overhead simultaneously. We analyze the effects of
multiple (local) intra-agent computations by the active agents between
successive inter-agent communications. For local computations, Bayesian
sampling via unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) MCMC is utilized. The
communication is assumed to be over a connected graph (e.g., as in
decentralized learning), however, the results can be extended to coordinated
communication where there is a central server (e.g., federated learning). We
theoretically quantify the convergence rates in the process. To demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we present simulations on a toy problem as
well as on real world data sets to train ML models to perform classification
tasks. We observe faster initial convergence and improved performance accuracy,
especially in the low data range. We achieve on average 78% and over 90%
classification accuracy respectively on the Gamma Telescope and mHealth data
sets from the UCI ML repository.

<p>As IoT devices become widely, it is crucial to protect them from malicious
intrusions. However, the data scarcity of IoT limits the applicability of
traditional intrusion detection methods, which are highly data-dependent. To
address this, in this paper we propose the Open-Set Dandelion Network (OSDN)
based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in an open-set manner.
The OSDN model performs intrusion knowledge transfer from the knowledge-rich
source network intrusion domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection
for the data-scarce target IoT intrusion domain. Under the open-set setting, it
can also detect newly-emerged target domain intrusions that are not observed in
the source domain. To achieve this, the OSDN model forms the source domain into
a dandelion-like feature space in which each intrusion category is compactly
grouped and different intrusion categories are separated, i.e., simultaneously
emphasising inter-category separability and intra-category compactness. The
dandelion-based target membership mechanism then forms the target dandelion.
Then, the dandelion angular separation mechanism achieves better inter-category
separability, and the dandelion embedding alignment mechanism further aligns
both dandelions in a finer manner. To promote intra-category compactness, the
discriminating sampled dandelion mechanism is used. Assisted by the intrusion
classifier trained using both known and generated unknown intrusion knowledge,
a semantic dandelion correction mechanism emphasises easily-confused categories
and guides better inter-category separability. Holistically, these mechanisms
form the OSDN model that effectively performs intrusion knowledge transfer to
benefit IoT intrusion detection. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion
datasets verify the effectiveness of the OSDN model, outperforming three
state-of-the-art baseline methods by 16.9%.

<p>Although gradient descent with momentum is widely used in modern deep

still remains elusive. In this work, we empirically show that momentum gradient
descent with a large learning rate and learning rate warmup displays large
catapults, driving the iterates towards flatter minima than those found by

<p>Providing a promising pathway to link the human brain with external devices,
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have seen notable advancements in decoding
capabilities, primarily driven by increasingly sophisticated techniques,
especially deep learning. However, achieving high accuracy in real-world
scenarios remains a challenge due to the distribution shift between sessions
and subjects. In this paper we will explore the concept of online test-time
adaptation (OTTA) to continuously adapt the model in an unsupervised fashion
during inference time. Our approach guarantees the preservation of privacy by
eliminating the requirement to access the source data during the adaptation
process. Additionally, OTTA achieves calibration-free operation by not
requiring any session- or subject-specific data. We will investigate the task
of electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery decoding using a lightweight

<p>The growth of global consumption has motivated important applications of deep

vibration data offers a rich and reliable source to provide meaningful insights
into machine health and predictive maintenance. In this work, we present
pretraining and fine-tuning frameworks for identifying bearing faults based on
transformer models. In particular, we investigate different tokenization and
data augmentation strategies to improve performance and reach state of the art
accuracies. Furthermore, we demonstrate masked self-supervised pretraining for
vibration signals and its application to low-data regimes, task adaptation, and
dataset adaptation. Pretraining is able to improve performance on 10-way
bearing classification on scarce, unseen training samples. Transformer models
also benefit from pretraining when fine-tuning on fault classes outside of the
pretraining distribution. Lastly, pretrained transformers are shown to be able
to generalize to a different dataset in a few-shot manner. This introduces a

<p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) are a versatile and principled
family of nonlinear dynamical system models. However, existing variational
learning and inference methods for GPSSMs often necessitate optimizing a
substantial number of variational parameters, leading to inadequate performance
and efficiency. To overcome this issue, we propose incorporating the ensemble
Kalman filter (EnKF), a well-established model-based filtering technique, into
the variational inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution
of latent states. This utilization of EnKF can effectively exploit the
dependencies between latent states and GP dynamics, while eliminating the need
for parameterizing the variational distribution, thereby significantly reducing
the number of variational parameters. Moreover, we show that our proposed
algorithm allows straightforward evaluation of an approximated evidence lower
bound (ELBO) in variational inference via simply summating multiple terms with
readily available closed-form solutions. Leveraging automatic differentiation
tools, we hence can maximize the ELBO and train the GPSSM efficiently. We also
extend the proposed algorithm to accommodate an online setting and provide
detailed algorithmic analyses and insights. Extensive evaluation on diverse
real and synthetic datasets demonstrates the superiority of our EnKF-aided
variational inference algorithms in terms of learning and inference performance
compared to existing methods.

<p>Directly predicting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status
from widely available hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images
(WSIs) can reduce technical costs and expedite treatment selection. Accurately
predicting HER2 requires large collections of multi-site WSIs. Federated
learning enables collaborative training of these WSIs without gigabyte-size
WSIs transportation and data privacy concerns. However, federated learning
encounters challenges in addressing label imbalance in multi-site WSIs from the
real world. Moreover, existing WSI classification methods cannot simultaneously
exploit local context information and long-range dependencies in the site-end
feature representation of federated learning. To address these issues, we
present a point transformer with federated learning for multi-site HER2 status
prediction from HE-stained WSIs. Our approach incorporates two novel designs.
We propose a dynamic label distribution strategy and an auxiliary classifier,
which helps to establish a well-initialized model and mitigate label
distribution variations across sites. Additionally, we propose a farthest
cosine sampling based on cosine distance. It can sample the most distinctive
features and capture the long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments and
analysis show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at four
sites with a total of 2687 WSIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can
generalize to two unseen sites with 229 WSIs.

<p>Mitigating catastrophic forgetting is a key hurdle in continual learning.
Deep Generative Replay (GR) provides techniques focused on generating samples
from prior tasks to enhance the model's memory capabilities. With the
progression in generative AI, generative models have advanced from Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the more recent Diffusion Models (DMs). A major
issue is the deterioration in the quality of generated data compared to the
original, as the generator continuously self-learns from its outputs. This
degradation can lead to the potential risk of catastrophic forgetting occurring
in the classifier. To address this, we propose the Class-Prototype Conditional
Diffusion Model (CPDM), a GR-based approach for continual learning that
enhances image quality in generators and thus reduces catastrophic forgetting
in classifiers. The cornerstone of CPDM is a learnable class-prototype that
captures the core characteristics of images in a given class. This prototype,
integrated into the diffusion model's denoising process, ensures the generation
of high-quality images. It maintains its effectiveness for old tasks even when
new tasks are introduced, preserving image generation quality and reducing the
risk of catastrophic forgetting in classifiers. Our empirical studies on
diverse datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art models, highlighting its exceptional ability to
preserve image quality and enhance the model's memory retention.

<p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values of a
time series given the past values. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on this
problem is attained in some cases by linear-centric models, which primarily
feature a linear mapping layer. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they
are not able to adapt their prediction rules to periodic changes in time series
patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts-style
augmentation for linear-centric models and propose Mixture-of-Linear-Experts
(MoLE). Instead of training a single model, MoLE trains multiple linear-centric
models (i.e., experts) and a router model that weighs and mixes their outputs.
While the entire framework is trained end-to-end, each expert learns to
specialize in a specific temporal pattern, and the router model learns to
compose the experts adaptively. Experiments show that MoLE reduces forecasting
error of linear-centric models, including DLinear, RLinear, and RMLP, in over
78% of the datasets and settings we evaluated. By using MoLE existing
linear-centric models can achieve SOTA LTSF results in 68% of the experiments
that PatchTST reports and we compare to, whereas existing single-head
linear-centric models achieve SOTA results in only 25% of cases. Additionally,
MoLE models achieve SOTA in all settings for the newly released Weather2K

<p>Bayesian optimization has become a powerful tool for safe online optimization
of systems, due to its high sample efficiency and noise robustness. For further
speed-up reduced physical models of the system can be incorporated into the
optimization to accelerate the process, since the models are able to offer an
approximation of the actual system, and sampling from them is significantly
cheaper. The similarity between model and reality is represented by additional
hyperparameters and learned within the optimization process. Safety is an
important criteria for online optimization methods like Bayesian optimization,
which has been addressed by recent literature, which provide safety guarantees
under the assumption of known hyperparameters. However, in practice this is not
applicable. Therefore, we extend the robust Gaussian process uniform error
bounds to meet the multi-task setting, which involves the calculation of a
confidence region from the hyperparameter posterior distribution utilizing
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Then, using the robust safety bounds,
Bayesian optimization is applied to safely optimize the system while
incorporating measurements of the models. Simulations show that the
optimization can be significantly accelerated compared to other
state-of-the-art safe Bayesian optimization methods depending on the fidelity
of the models.

<p>In this study, we present a deep learning framework designed to integrate
with our previously developed system that facilitates large-scale 1D fetal
Doppler data collection, aiming to enhance data quality. This system, tailored
for traditional Indigenous midwives in low-resource communities, leverages a
cost-effective Android phone to improve the quality of recorded signals. We
have shown that the Doppler data can be used to identify fetal growth
restriction, hypertension, and other concerning issues during pregnancy.
However, the quality of the signal is dependent on many factors, including
radio frequency interference, position of the fetus, maternal body habitus, and
usage of the Doppler by the birth attendants. In order to provide instant
feedback to allow correction of the data at source, a signal quality metric is
required that can run in real-time on the mobile phone.
</p>
<p>In this study, 191 DUS signals with durations mainly in the range between 5

Good, Poor, (Radiofrequency) Interference, Talking, and Silent, at a resolution
of 3.75 seconds. A deep neural network was trained on each 3.75-second segment

<p>While deep learning models have shown significant performance across various
domains, their deployment needs extensive resources and advanced computing
infrastructure. As a solution, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has
emerged, lowering the barriers for users to release or productize their deep
learning models. However, previous studies have highlighted potential privacy
and security concerns associated with MLaaS, and one primary threat is model
extraction attacks. To address this, there are many defense solutions but they
suffer from unrealistic assumptions and generalization issues, making them less
practical for reliable protection. Driven by these limitations, we introduce a
novel defense mechanism, SAME, based on the concept of sample reconstruction.
This strategy imposes minimal prerequisites on the defender's capabilities,
eliminating the need for auxiliary Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, user
query history, white-box model access, and additional intervention during model
training. It is compatible with existing active defense methods. Our extensive
experiments corroborate the superior efficacy of SAME over state-of-the-art
solutions. Our code is available at https://github.com/xythink/SAME.

<p>We propose a Reinforcement-Learning-based system that would automatically
prescribe a hypothetical patient medication that may help the patient with
their mental-health-related speech disfluency, and adjust the medication and
the dosages in response to zero-cost frequent measurement of the fluency of the
patient. We demonstrate the components of the system: a module that detects and
evaluates speech disfluency on a large dataset we built, and a Reinforcement
Learning algorithm that automatically finds good combinations of medications.
To support the two modules, we collect data on the effect of psychiatric
medications for speech disfluency from the literature, and build a plausible
patient simulation system. We demonstrate that the Reinforcement Learning
system is, under some circumstances, able to converge to a good medication
regime. We collect and label a dataset of people with possible speech
disfluency and demonstrate our methods using that dataset. Our work is a proof
of concept: we show that there is promise in the idea of using automatic data
collection to address disfluency.

<p>Inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), which highlights the
existence of efficient subnetworks within larger, dense networks, a
high-performing Winning Subnetwork (WSN) in terms of task performance under
appropriate sparsity conditions is considered for various continual learning
tasks. It leverages pre-existing weights from dense networks to achieve
efficient learning in Task Incremental Learning (TIL) scenarios. In Few-Shot
Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), a variation of WSN referred to as the Soft
subnetwork (SoftNet) is designed to prevent overfitting when the data samples
are scarce. Furthermore, the sparse reuse of WSN weights is considered for
Video Incremental Learning (VIL). The use of Fourier Subneural Operator (FSO)
within WSN is considered. It enables compact encoding of videos and identifies
reusable subnetworks across varying bandwidths. We have integrated FSO into
different architectural frameworks for continual learning, including VIL, TIL,

significantly improving task performance at various convolutional

<p>Semantic image synthesis, i.e., generating images from user-provided semantic
label maps, is an important conditional image generation task as it allows to
control both the content as well as the spatial layout of generated images.
Although diffusion models have pushed the state of the art in generative image
modeling, the iterative nature of their inference process makes them
computationally demanding. Other approaches such as GANs are more efficient as
they only need a single feed-forward pass for generation, but the image quality
tends to suffer on large and diverse datasets. In this work, we propose a new
class of GAN discriminators for semantic image synthesis that generates highly
realistic images by exploiting feature backbone networks pre-trained for tasks
such as image classification. We also introduce a new generator architecture
with better context modeling and using cross-attention to inject noise into
latent variables, leading to more diverse generated images. Our model, which we
dub DP-SIMS, achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality and
consistency with the input label maps on ADE-20K, COCO-Stuff, and Cityscapes,
surpassing recent diffusion models while requiring two orders of magnitude less
compute for inference.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13650">Distributed Quantum Neural Networks via Partitioned Features Encoding. (arXiv:2312.13650v2 [quant-ph] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Quantum neural networks are expected to be a promising application in
near-term quantum computing, but face challenges such as vanishing gradients
during optimization and limited expressibility by a limited number of qubits
and shallow circuits. To mitigate these challenges, an approach using
distributed quantum neural networks has been proposed to make a prediction by
approximating outputs of a large circuit using multiple small circuits.
However, the approximation of a large circuit requires an exponential number of
small circuit evaluations. Here, we instead propose to distribute partitioned
features over multiple small quantum neural networks and use the ensemble of
their expectation values to generate predictions. To verify our distributed
approach, we demonstrate ten class classification of the Semeion and MNIST
handwritten digit datasets. The results of the Semeion dataset imply that while
our distributed approach may outperform a single quantum neural network in
classification performance, excessive partitioning reduces performance.
Nevertheless, for the MNIST dataset, we succeeded in ten class classification
with exceeding 96\% accuracy. Our proposed method not only achieved highly
accurate predictions for a large dataset but also reduced the hardware
requirements for each quantum neural network compared to a large single quantum
neural network. Our results highlight distributed quantum neural networks as a
promising direction for practical quantum machine learning algorithms
compatible with near-term quantum devices. We hope that our approach is useful
for exploring quantum machine learning applications.

<p>Machine learning models are being used in an increasing number of critical
applications; thus, securing their integrity and ownership is critical. Recent
studies observed that adversarial training and watermarking have a conflicting
interaction. This work introduces a novel framework to integrate adversarial
training with watermarking techniques to fortify against evasion attacks and
provide confident model verification in case of intellectual property theft. We
use adversarial training together with adversarial watermarks to train a robust
watermarked model. The key intuition is to use a higher perturbation budget to
generate adversarial watermarks compared to the budget used for adversarial
training, thus avoiding conflict. We use the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets
to evaluate our proposed technique on various model stealing attacks. The
results obtained consistently outperform the existing baseline in terms of
robustness performance and further prove the resilience of this defense against
pruning and fine-tuning removal attacks.

<p>While data is distributed in multiple edge devices, Federated Learning (FL)
is attracting more and more attention to collaboratively train a machine
learning model without transferring raw data. FL generally exploits a parameter
server and a large number of edge devices during the whole process of the model
training, while several devices are selected in each round. However, straggler
devices may slow down the training process or even make the system crash during
training. Meanwhile, other idle edge devices remain unused. As the bandwidth
between the devices and the server is relatively low, the communication of
intermediate data becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose
Time-Efficient Asynchronous federated learning with Sparsification and
Quantization, i.e., TEASQ-Fed. TEASQ-Fed can fully exploit edge devices to
asynchronously participate in the training process by actively applying for
tasks. We utilize control parameters to choose an appropriate number of
parallel edge devices, which simultaneously execute the training tasks. In
addition, we introduce a caching mechanism and weighted averaging with respect
to model staleness to further improve the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a
sparsification and quantitation approach to compress the intermediate data to
accelerate the training. The experimental results reveal that TEASQ-Fed
improves the accuracy (up to 16.67% higher) while accelerating the convergence
of model training (up to twice faster).

<p>The emergence of on-demand ride pooling services allows each vehicle to serve
multiple passengers at a time, thus increasing drivers' income and enabling
passengers to travel at lower prices than taxi/car on-demand services (only one
passenger can be assigned to a car at a time like UberX and Lyft). Although
on-demand ride pooling services can bring so many benefits, ride pooling
services need a well-defined matching strategy to maximize the benefits for all
parties (passengers, drivers, aggregation companies and environment), in which
the regional dispatching of vehicles has a significant impact on the matching
and revenue. Existing algorithms often only consider revenue maximization,
which makes it difficult for requests with unusual distribution to get a ride.
How to increase revenue while ensuring a reasonable assignment of requests
brings a challenge to ride pooling service companies (aggregation companies).
In this paper, we propose a framework for vehicle dispatching for ride pooling
tasks, which splits the city into discrete dispatching regions and uses the
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to dispatch vehicles in these regions. We
also consider the mutual information (MI) between vehicle and order
distribution as the intrinsic reward of the RL algorithm to improve the
correlation between their distributions, thus ensuring the possibility of
getting a ride for unusually distributed requests. In experimental results on a
real-world taxi dataset, we demonstrate that our framework can significantly
increase revenue up to an average of 3\% over the existing best on-demand ride
pooling method.

<p>Transformers have achieved promising results on a variety of tasks. However,
the quadratic complexity in self-attention computation has limited the
applications, especially in low-resource settings and mobile or edge devices.
Existing works have proposed to exploit hand-crafted attention patterns to
reduce computation complexity. However, such hand-crafted patterns are
data-agnostic and may not be optimal. Hence, it is likely that relevant keys or
values are being reduced, while less important ones are still preserved. Based
on this key insight, we propose a novel deformable audio Transformer for audio
recognition, named DATAR, where a deformable attention equipping with a pyramid
transformer backbone is constructed and learnable. Such an architecture has
been proven effective in prediction tasks,~\textit{e.g.}, event classification.
Moreover, we identify that the deformable attention map computation may
over-simplify the input feature, which can be further enhanced. Hence, we
introduce a learnable input adaptor to alleviate this issue, and DATAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

investigated the mechanism of knowledge distillation against distribution
shift. Distribution shift refers to the data distribution drifts between
training and testing phases. In this paper, we reconsider the paradigm of
knowledge distillation by reformulating the objective function in shift
situations. Under the real scenarios, we propose a unified and systematic
framework to benchmark knowledge distillation against two general
distributional shifts including diversity and correlation shift. The evaluation
benchmark covers more than 30 methods from algorithmic, data-driven, and

based algorithm to optimize preference learning, which first fitting a reward
model for preference score, and then optimizing generating policy with
on-policy PPO algorithm to maximize the reward. The processing of RLHF is
complex, time-consuming and unstable. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
algorithm using off-policy algorithm to direct optimize generating policy and
eliminating the need for reward model, which is data efficient and stable. DPO
use Bradley-Terry model and log-loss which leads to over-fitting to the
preference data at the expense of ignoring KL-regularization term when
preference is deterministic. IPO uses a root-finding MSE loss to solve the
ignoring KL-regularization problem. In this paper, we'll figure out, although
IPO fix the problem when preference is deterministic, but both DPO and IPO
fails the KL-regularization term because the support of preference distribution
not equal to reference distribution. Then, we design a simple and intuitive
off-policy preference optimization algorithm from an importance sampling view,
which we call Maximum Preference Optimization (MPO), and add off-policy
KL-regularization terms which makes KL-regularization truly effective. The
objective of MPO bears resemblance to RLHF's objective, and likes IPO, MPO is
off-policy. So, MPO attains the best of both worlds. To simplify the learning

<p>The characteristics of data like distribution and heterogeneity, become more
complex and counterintuitive as the dimensionality increases. This phenomenon
is known as curse of dimensionality, where common patterns and relationships
(e.g., internal and boundary pattern) that hold in low-dimensional space may be
invalid in higher-dimensional space. It leads to a decreasing performance for
the regression, classification or clustering models or algorithms. Curse of
dimensionality can be attributed to many causes. In this paper, we first
summarize five challenges associated with manipulating high-dimensional data,
and explains the potential causes for the failure of regression, classification
or clustering tasks. Subsequently, we delve into two major causes of the curse
of dimensionality, distance concentration and manifold effect, by performing
theoretical and empirical analyses. The results demonstrate that nearest
neighbor search (NNS) using three typical distance measurements, Minkowski
distance, Chebyshev distance, and cosine distance, becomes meaningless as the
dimensionality increases. Meanwhile, the data incorporates more redundant
features, and the variance contribution of principal component analysis (PCA)
is skewed towards a few dimensions. By interpreting the causes of the curse of
dimensionality, we can better understand the limitations of current models and
algorithms, and drive to improve the performance of data analysis and machine
learning tasks in high-dimensional space.

<p>With the growing use of large language models hosted on cloud platforms to
offer inference services, privacy concerns are escalating, especially
concerning sensitive data like investment plans and bank account details.
Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect
the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of
SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for large language models,
particularly those based on the Transformer architecture, often leads to
considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the
multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are
not well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To
address this concern, we introduce an advanced optimization framework called
SecFormer, to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. By
implementing model design optimization, we successfully eliminate the high-cost

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in
understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.
However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands
during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge
is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating
frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new
knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many
applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address
deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in
efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end,
recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for
LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains
while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we
first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive
review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and
cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that
classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external
knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.
Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.
Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can
provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within
LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,
outlining its broad and impactful implications.

<p>In this work we present deep learning implementations of two popular
theoretical constrained optimization algorithms in infinite dimensional Hilbert
spaces, namely, the penalty and the augmented Lagrangian methods. We test these
algorithms on some toy problems originating in either calculus of variations or
physics. We demonstrate that both methods are able to produce decent
approximations for the test problems and are comparable in terms of different
errors produced. Leveraging the common occurrence of the Lagrange multiplier
update rule being computationally less expensive than solving subproblems in
the penalty method, we achieve significant speedups in cases when the output of
the constraint function is itself a function.

<p>The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during
the first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain
connectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three
major limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction
tasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality
or connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require
extensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often
challenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time
series data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a
federated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of
federation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited
datasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local
generative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of
FedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework
specifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a
data-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the
local objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity
within the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)
introducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based
precompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors
to improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive
experimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain
multi-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with

<p>Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise
couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting
behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or
independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability
of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic
complexity of $O(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible
pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most
networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is
only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of
reconstruction problems that achieves its result in subquadratic time, with a
data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with
a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. Our algorithm relies on
a stochastic second neighbor search that produces the best edge candidates with
high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. In practice,
our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster
than the quadratic baseline, allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables
the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of
nodes and edges.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhu_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">Wentao Zhu</a></p>
<p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of
Computer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of
input tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained
settings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address
this challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in
all the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is
often not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful
in later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token
propagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different
token-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control
the reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient
token utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose
a smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy
outliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC,
we introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image
structures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present
extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT
and Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For
example, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the
inference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification
accuracy by 1.0%.

<p>This paper explores the frontiers of large language models (LLMs) in
psychology applications. Psychology has undergone several theoretical changes,
and the current use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning,
particularly LLMs, promises to open up new research directions. We provide a
detailed exploration of how LLMs like ChatGPT are transforming psychological
research. It discusses the impact of LLMs across various branches of
psychology, including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling,
educational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology, highlighting
their potential to simulate aspects of human cognition and behavior. The paper
delves into the capabilities of these models to emulate human-like text

research methodologies in psychology, the paper also cautions about their
technical and ethical challenges. There are issues like data privacy, the
ethical implications of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for
a deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should
responsibly use LLMs in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards
and considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in
sensitive areas. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the

<p>Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims to find the nodes whose
behaviors are significantly different from other majority nodes. Generally,
network data contains information about relationships between entities, and the
anomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to
comprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major
focus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily
assumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon
obliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal
entities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by
anomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive
learning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks,
\textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and
provide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by
introducing sparsification into the conventional method. Extensive experiments
are conducted on five benchmark real-world datasets and the results show that
SCALA consistently outperforms all baseline methods significantly.

<p>Using large training datasets enhances the generalization capabilities of
neural networks. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is useful when there are few
labeled data and a lot of unlabeled data. SSL methods that use data
augmentation are most successful for image datasets. In contrast, texts do not
have consistent augmentation methods as images. Consequently, methods that use
augmentation are not as effective in text data as they are in image data. In
this study, we compared SSL algorithms that do not require augmentation; these
are self-training, co-training, tri-training, and tri-training with
disagreement. In the experiments, we used 4 different text datasets for
different tasks. We examined the algorithms from a variety of perspectives by
asking experiment questions and suggested several improvements. Among the
algorithms, tri-training with disagreement showed the closest performance to
the Oracle; however, performance gap shows that new semi-supervised algorithms
or improvements in existing methods are needed.

<p>Generating explanations for graph neural networks (GNNs) has been studied to
understand their behavior in analytical tasks such as graph classification.
Existing approaches aim to understand the overall results of GNNs rather than
providing explanations for specific class labels of interest, and may return
explanation structures that are hard to access, nor directly queryable.We
propose GVEX, a novel paradigm that generates Graph Views for EXplanation. (1)
We design a two-tier explanation structure called explanation views. An
explanation view consists of a set of graph patterns and a set of induced
explanation subgraphs. Given a database G of multiple graphs and a specific
class label l assigned by a GNN-based classifier M, it concisely describes the
fraction of G that best explains why l is assigned by M. (2) We propose quality
measures and formulate an optimization problem to compute optimal explanation
views for GNN explanation. We show that the problem is $\Sigma^2_P$-hard. (3)
We present two algorithms. The first one follows an explain-and-summarize
strategy that first generates high-quality explanation subgraphs which best
explain GNNs in terms of feature influence maximization, and then performs a
summarization step to generate patterns. We show that this strategy provides an
approximation ratio of 1/2. Our second algorithm performs a single-pass to an
input node stream in batches to incrementally maintain explanation views,
having an anytime quality guarantee of 1/4 approximation. Using real-world
benchmark data, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,
and scalability of GVEX. Through case studies, we showcase the practical
applications of GVEX.

<p>Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) estimates return distribution
mainly by learning quantile values via minimizing the quantile Huber loss
function, entailing a threshold parameter often selected heuristically or via
hyperparameter search, which may not generalize well and can be suboptimal.
This paper introduces a generalized quantile Huber loss function derived from
Wasserstein distance (WD) calculation between Gaussian distributions, capturing
noise in predicted (current) and target (Bellman-updated) quantile values.
Compared to the classical quantile Huber loss, this innovative loss function
enhances robustness against outliers. Notably, the classical Huber loss
function can be seen as an approximation of our proposed loss, enabling
parameter adjustment by approximating the amount of noise in the data during
the learning process. Empirical tests on Atari games, a common application in
distributional RL, and a recent hedging strategy using distributional RL,
validate the effectiveness of our proposed loss function and its potential for
parameter adjustments in distributional RL. The implementation of the proposed
loss function is available here.

<p>Federated learning (FL) enables multiple data owners (a.k.a. FL clients) to
collaboratively train machine learning models without disclosing sensitive
private data. Existing FL research mostly focuses on the monopoly scenario in
which a single FL server selects a subset of FL clients to update their local
models in each round of training. In practice, there can be multiple FL servers
simultaneously trying to select clients from the same pool. In this paper, we
propose a first-of-its-kind Fairness-aware Federated Job Scheduling (FairFedJS)
approach to bridge this gap. Based on Lyapunov optimization, it ensures fair
allocation of high-demand FL client datasets to FL jobs in need of them, by
jointly considering the current demand and the job payment bids, in order to
prevent prolonged waiting. Extensive experiments comparing FairFedJS against
four state-of-the-art approaches on two datasets demonstrate its significant
advantages. It outperforms the best baseline by 31.9% and 1.0% on average in
