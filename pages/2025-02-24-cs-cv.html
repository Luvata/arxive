<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Chen, Zhengqing Hu, Peiguang Fan, Yueting Zhuang, Yafei Li, Qidong Liu, Xiaoheng Jiang, Mingliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision anomaly detection, particularly in unsupervised settings, often struggles to distinguish between normal samples and anomalies due to the wide variability in anomalies. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on generating anomalies to help detectors learn more effective boundaries between normal samples and anomalies. However, as the generated anomalies are often derived from random factors, they frequently lack realism. Additionally, randomly generated anomalies typically offer limited support in constructing effective boundaries, as most differ substantially from normal samples and lie far from the boundary. To address these challenges, we propose Key Knowledge Augmentation (KKA), a method that extracts anomaly-related knowledge from large language models (LLMs). More specifically, KKA leverages the extensive prior knowledge of LLMs to generate meaningful anomalies based on normal samples. Then, KKA classifies the generated anomalies as easy anomalies and hard anomalies according to their similarity to normal samples. Easy anomalies exhibit significant differences from normal samples, whereas hard anomalies closely resemble normal samples. KKA iteratively updates the generated anomalies, and gradually increasing the proportion of hard anomalies to enable the detector to learn a more effective boundary. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of various vision anomaly detectors while maintaining low generation costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeliang Zhang, Yifan Zhu, Susan Liang, Zhiyuan Wang, Jiani Liu, Haiting Lin, Mingjie Zhao, Chenliang Xu, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, yet their computational overhead during deployment remains a critical challenge. While Key-Value (KV) caching improves inference efficiency by trading memory for computation, the growing memory footprint from storing extensive KV caches reduces throughput and limits long-term execution on devices with constrained GPU memory. Existing approaches primarily focus on dropping unimportant tokens to reduce the KV cache size, mitigating memory constraints at the cost of potential information loss. In contrast, we propose a simple yet effective visual quantization strategy that preserves all visual tokens while significantly reducing memory consumption. To achieve an extreme quantization ratio, i.e., 1-bit quantization, we propose group-specific quantization and quantile-based quantization approaches, motivated by the inherent patterns of the KV cache. Our method is plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration into various MLLMs to improve memory efficiency without architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces memory overhead while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving multimodal performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Na Min An, Eunki Kim, Wan Ju Kang, Sangryul Kim, Hyunjung Shim, James Thorne</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision is a primary means of how humans perceive the environment, but Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) people need assistance understanding their surroundings, especially in unfamiliar environments. The emergence of semantic-based systems as assistance tools for BLV users has motivated many researchers to explore responses from Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, it has yet been studied preferences of BLV users on diverse types/styles of responses from LVLMs, specifically for navigational aid. To fill this gap, we first construct Eye4B dataset, consisting of human-validated 1.1k curated outdoor/indoor scenes with 5-10 relevant requests per scene. Then, we conduct an in-depth user study with eight BLV users to evaluate their preferences on six LVLMs from five perspectives: Afraidness, Nonactionability, Sufficiency, and Conciseness. Finally, we introduce Eye4B benchmark for evaluating alignment between widely used model-based image-text metrics and our collected BLV preferences. Our work can be set as a guideline for developing BLV-aware LVLMs towards a Barrier-Free AI system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Jin, Yuqi Jiang, Xudong Lu, Yumeng Liu, Yining Chen, Dawei Gao, Qi Sun, Cheng Zhuo</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of integrated circuit manufacturing, the detection and classification of nanoscale wafer defects are critical for subsequent root cause analysis and yield enhancement. The complex background patterns observed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and the diverse textures of the defects pose significant challenges. Traditional methods usually suffer from insufficient data, labels, and poor transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning approach, SEM-CLIP, for accurate defect classification and segmentation. SEM-CLIP customizes the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model to better focus on defect areas and minimize background distractions, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy. We employ text prompts enriched with domain knowledge as prior information to assist in precise analysis. Additionally, our approach incorporates feature engineering with textual guidance to categorize defects more effectively. SEM-CLIP requires little annotated data, substantially reducing labor demands in the semiconductor industry. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that our model achieves impressive classification and segmentation results under few-shot learning scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ufaq Khan, Umair Nawaz, Adnan Qayyum, Shazad Ashraf, Muhammad Bilal, Junaid Qadir</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), particularly through the introduction of foundational models (FMs), have significantly enhanced surgical scene understanding within minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This paper surveys the integration of state-of-the-art ML and DL technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and foundational models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), into surgical workflows. These technologies improve segmentation accuracy, instrument tracking, and phase recognition in surgical endoscopic video analysis. The paper explores the challenges these technologies face, such as data variability and computational demands, and discusses ethical considerations and integration hurdles in clinical settings. Highlighting the roles of FMs, we bridge the technological capabilities with clinical needs and outline future research directions to enhance the adaptability, efficiency, and ethical alignment of AI applications in surgery. Our findings suggest that substantial progress has been made; however, more focused efforts are required to achieve seamless integration of these technologies into clinical workflows, ensuring they complement surgical practice by enhancing precision, reducing risks, and optimizing patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilin Ruan, Siru Zhong, Haomin Wen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful frameworks for generating high-quality images. While recent studies have explored their application to time series forecasting, these approaches face significant challenges in cross-modal modeling and transforming visual information effectively to capture temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose LDM4TS, a novel framework that leverages the powerful image reconstruction capabilities of latent diffusion models for vision-enhanced time series forecasting. Instead of introducing external visual data, we are the first to use complementary transformation techniques to convert time series into multi-view visual representations, allowing the model to exploit the rich feature extraction capabilities of the pre-trained vision encoder. Subsequently, these representations are reconstructed using a latent diffusion model with a cross-modal conditioning mechanism as well as a fusion module. Experimental results demonstrate that LDM4TS outperforms various specialized forecasting models for time series forecasting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqi Yan, Xiangxiang Cui, Lu Yin, Paul Pu Liang, Yulan He, Yifei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in feature monosemanticity to extract interpretable features from deep multimodal models, offering a data-driven understanding of modality gaps. Specifically, we investigate CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a prominent visual-language representation model trained on extensive image-text pairs. Building upon interpretability tools developed for single-modal models, we extend these methodologies to assess multi-modal interpretability of CLIP features. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute the interpretability of each feature to its respective modality. Next, we transform CLIP features into a more interpretable space, enabling us to categorize them into three distinct classes: vision features (single-modal), language features (single-modal), and visual-language features (cross-modal). Our findings reveal that this categorization aligns closely with human cognitive understandings of different modalities. We also demonstrate significant use cases of this modality-specific features including detecting gender bias, adversarial attack defense and text-to-image model editing. These results indicate that large-scale multimodal models, equipped with task-agnostic interpretability tools, offer valuable insights into key connections and distinctions between different modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Zhu, Zhibo Jin, Jiayu Zhang, Nan Yang, Jiahao Huang, Jianlong Zhou, Fang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of identifying multimodal image-text representations has garnered increasing attention, particularly with models such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), which demonstrate exceptional performance in learning complex associations between images and text. Despite these advancements, ensuring the interpretability of such models is paramount for their safe deployment in real-world applications, such as healthcare. While numerous interpretability methods have been developed for unimodal tasks, these approaches often fail to transfer effectively to multimodal contexts due to inherent differences in the representation structures. Bottleneck methods, well-established in information theory, have been applied to enhance CLIP's interpretability. However, they are often hindered by strong assumptions or intrinsic randomness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Narrowing Information Bottleneck Theory, a novel framework that fundamentally redefines the traditional bottleneck approach. This theory is specifically designed to satisfy contemporary attribution axioms, providing a more robust and reliable solution for improving the interpretability of multimodal models. In our experiments, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach enhances image interpretability by an average of 9%, text interpretability by an average of 58.83%, and accelerates processing speed by 63.95%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taminul Islam, Toqi Tahamid Sarker, Khaled R Ahmed, Cristiana Bernardi Rankrape, Karla Gage</p>
<p>Abstract: Weed management remains a critical challenge in agriculture, where weeds compete with crops for essential resources, leading to significant yield losses. Accurate detection of weeds at various growth stages is crucial for effective management yet challenging for farmers, as it requires identifying different species at multiple growth phases. This research addresses these challenges by utilizing advanced object detection models, specifically, the Detection Transformer (DETR) with a ResNet50 backbone and RetinaNet with a ResNeXt101 backbone, to identify and classify 16 weed species of economic concern across 174 classes, spanning their 11 weeks growth stages from seedling to maturity. A robust dataset comprising 203,567 images was developed, meticulously labeled by species and growth stage. The models were rigorously trained and evaluated, with RetinaNet demonstrating superior performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.907 on the training set and 0.904 on the test set, compared to DETR's mAP of 0.854 and 0.840, respectively. RetinaNet also outperformed DETR in recall and inference speed of 7.28 FPS, making it more suitable for real time applications. Both models showed improved accuracy as plants matured. This research provides crucial insights for developing precise, sustainable, and automated weed management strategies, paving the way for real time species specific detection systems and advancing AI-assisted agriculture through continued innovation in model development and early detection accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Huang, Shuo Wang, Yongcai Wang, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting when to initiate speech in real-world environments remains a fundamental challenge for conversational agents. We introduce EgoSpeak, a novel framework for real-time speech initiation prediction in egocentric streaming video. By modeling the conversation from the speaker's first-person viewpoint, EgoSpeak is tailored for human-like interactions in which a conversational agent must continuously observe its environment and dynamically decide when to talk. Our approach bridges the gap between simplified experimental setups and complex natural conversations by integrating four key capabilities: (1) first-person perspective, (2) RGB processing, (3) online processing, and (4) untrimmed video processing. We also present YT-Conversation, a diverse collection of in-the-wild conversational videos from YouTube, as a resource for large-scale pretraining. Experiments on EasyCom and Ego4D demonstrate that EgoSpeak outperforms random and silence-based baselines in real time. Our results also highlight the importance of multimodal input and context length in effectively deciding when to speak.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingni Tang, Jiajia Li, Lu Yang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jinghao Tian, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Ping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic music is represented in two distinct forms: two-dimensional, visually intuitive score images, and one-dimensional, standardized text annotation sequences. While large language models have shown extraordinary potential in music, current research has primarily focused on unimodal symbol sequence text. Existing general-domain visual language models still lack the ability of music notation understanding. Recognizing this gap, we propose NOTA, the first large-scale comprehensive multimodal music notation dataset. It consists of 1,019,237 records, from 3 regions of the world, and contains 3 tasks. Based on the dataset, we trained NotaGPT, a music notation visual large language model. Specifically, we involve a pre-alignment training phase for cross-modal alignment between the musical notes depicted in music score images and their textual representation in ABC notation. Subsequent training phases focus on foundational music information extraction, followed by training on music notation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our NotaGPT-7B achieves significant improvement on music understanding, showcasing the effectiveness of NOTA and the training pipeline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jowaria Khan, Alexa Friedman, Sydney Evans, Runzi Wang, Kaley Beins, David Andrews, Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziye Wang, Yiran Qin, Lin Zeng, Ruimao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning. Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating high-quality, diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, their ability to reproduce copyrighted styles, sensitive imagery, and harmful content raises significant ethical and legal concerns. Concept erasure offers a proactive alternative to external filtering by modifying T2I models to prevent the generation of undesired content. In this survey, we provide a structured overview of concept erasure, categorizing existing methods based on their optimization strategies and the architectural components they modify. We categorize concept erasure methods into fine-tuning for parameter updates, closed-form solutions for efficient edits, and inference-time interventions for content restriction without weight modification. Additionally, we explore adversarial attacks that bypass erasure techniques and discuss emerging defenses. To support further research, we consolidate key datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks for assessing erasure effectiveness and model robustness. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into the evolving landscape of concept erasure, its challenges, and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghang Lyu, Chinmay Rao, Marius Staring, Matthias J. P. van Osch, Mariya Doneva, Hildo J. Lamb, Nicola Pezzotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is vital for diagnosing heart diseases, but long scan time remains a major drawback. To address this, accelerated imaging techniques have been introduced by undersampling k-space, which reduces the quality of the resulting images. Recent deep learning advancements aim to speed up scanning while preserving quality, but adapting to various sampling modes and undersampling factors remains challenging. Therefore, building a universal model is a promising direction. In this work, we introduce UPCMR, a universal unrolled model designed for CMR reconstruction. This model incorporates two kinds of learnable prompts, undersampling-specific prompt and spatial-specific prompt, and integrates them with a UNet structure in each block. Overall, by using the CMRxRecon2024 challenge dataset for training and validation, the UPCMR model highly enhances reconstructed image quality across all random sampling scenarios through an effective training strategy compared to some traditional methods, demonstrating strong adaptability potential for this task.</p>

In this work, we propose \segsub, a framework that applies targeted perturbations to image sources to study and improve the robustness of VLMs against three different types of knowledge conflicts, namely parametric, source, and counterfactual conflicts. Contrary to prior findings that showed that LLMs are sensitive to parametric conflicts arising from textual perturbations, we find VLMs are largely robust to image perturbation. On the other hand, VLMs perform poorly on counterfactual examples (<30% accuracy) and fail to reason over source conflicts (<1% accuracy). We also find a link between hallucinations and image context, with GPT-4o prone to hallucination when presented with highly contextualized counterfactual examples. While challenges persist with source conflicts, finetuning models significantly improves reasoning over counterfactual samples. Our findings highlight the need for VLM training methodologies that enhance their reasoning capabilities, particularly in addressing complex knowledge conflicts between multimodal sources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuong V. Nguyen, Hieu X. Nguyen, Dung D. Pham Minh, Cuong D. Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded on paper remain prevalent in clinical practice, yet their use presents challenges for automated analysis and digital storage. To address this issue, we introduce PTB-Image, a dataset comprising scanned paper ECGs with corresponding digital signals, enabling research on ECG digitization. We also provide VinDigitizer, a digitization baseline to convert paper-based ECGs into digital time-series signals. The method involves detecting signal rows, extracting waveforms from the background, and reconstructing numerical values from the digitized traces. We applied VinDigitizer to 549 scanned ECGs and evaluated its performance against the original PTB dataset (modified to match the printed signals). The results achieved a mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0.01 dB, highlighting both the feasibility and challenges of ECG digitization, particularly in mitigating distortions from printing and scanning processes. By providing PTB-Image and baseline digitization methods, this work aims to facilitate advancements in ECG digitization, enhancing access to historical ECG data and supporting applications in telemedicine and automated cardiac diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Liu, Chen-Wei Xie, Bin Wen, Feiwu Yu, Jixuan Chen, Boqiang Zhang, Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Yun Zheng, Hongtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rendered traditional visual captioning benchmarks obsolete, as they primarily evaluate short descriptions with outdated metrics. While recent benchmarks address these limitations by decomposing captions into visual elements and adopting model-based evaluation, they remain incomplete-overlooking critical aspects, while providing vague, non-explanatory scores. To bridge this gap, we propose CV-CapBench, a Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark that systematically evaluates caption quality across 6 views and 13 dimensions. CV-CapBench introduces precision, recall, and hit rate metrics for each dimension, uniquely assessing both correctness and coverage. Experiments on leading MLLMs reveal significant capability gaps, particularly in dynamic and knowledge-intensive dimensions. These findings provide actionable insights for future research. The code and data will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhao, Qirui Yuan, Jinyu Li, Haofeng Hu, Yun Li, Chengyuan Zheng, Fei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving, which directly maps raw sensor inputs to low-level vehicle controls, is an important part of Embodied AI. Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliott Thomas, Mickael Coustaty, Aurelie Joseph, Elodie Carel, Vincent Poulain D'Andecy, Jean-Marc Ogier</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting tables from documents is a critical task across various industries, especially on business documents like invoices and reports. Existing systems based on DEtection TRansformer (DETR) such as TAble TRansformer (TATR), offer solutions for Table Detection (TD) and Table Structure Recognition (TSR) but face challenges with diverse table formats and common errors like incorrect area detection and overlapping columns. This research introduces RAPTOR, a modular post-processing system designed to enhance state-of-the-art models for improved table extraction, particularly for product tables. RAPTOR addresses recurrent TD and TSR issues, improving both precision and structural predictions. For TD, we use DETR (trained on ICDAR 2019) and TATR (trained on PubTables-1M and FinTabNet), while TSR only relies on TATR. A Genetic Algorithm is incorporated to optimize RAPTOR's module parameters, using a private dataset of product tables to align with industrial needs. We evaluate our method on two private datasets of product tables, the public DOCILE dataset (which contains tables similar to our target product tables), and the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 datasets. The results demonstrate that while our approach excels at product tables, it also maintains reasonable performance across diverse table formats. An ablation study further validates the contribution of each module in our system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rendering large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model faces significant challenges in achieving real-time, high-fidelity performance on consumer-grade devices. Fully realizing the potential of 3DGS in applications such as virtual reality (VR) requires addressing critical system-level challenges to support real-time, immersive experiences. We propose GS-Cache, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates 3DGS's advanced representation with a highly optimized rendering system. GS-Cache introduces a cache-centric pipeline to eliminate redundant computations, an efficiency-aware scheduler for elastic multi-GPU rendering, and optimized CUDA kernels to overcome computational bottlenecks. This synergy between 3DGS and system design enables GS-Cache to achieve up to 5.35x performance improvement, 35% latency reduction, and 42% lower GPU memory usage, supporting 2K binocular rendering at over 120 FPS with high visual quality. By bridging the gap between 3DGS's representation power and the demands of VR systems, GS-Cache establishes a scalable and efficient framework for real-time neural rendering in immersive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rim Slama, Wael Rabah, Hazem Wannous</p>
<p>Abstract: Online continuous action recognition has emerged as a critical research area due to its practical implications in real-world applications, such as human-computer interaction, healthcare, and robotics. Among various modalities, skeleton-based approaches have gained significant popularity, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing 3D temporal data while ensuring robustness to environmental variations. However, most existing works focus on segment-based recognition, making them unsuitable for real-time, continuous recognition scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel online recognition system designed for real-time skeleton sequence streaming. Our approach leverages a hybrid architecture combining Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (S-GCN) for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer-based Graph Encoder (TGE) for capturing temporal dependencies across frames. Additionally, we introduce a continual learning mechanism to enhance model adaptability to evolving data distributions, ensuring robust recognition in dynamic environments. We evaluate our method on the SHREC'21 benchmark dataset, demonstrating its superior performance in online hand gesture recognition. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly reduces false positive rates, making it a compelling solution for real-time applications. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into various domains, including human-robot collaboration and assistive technologies, where natural and intuitive interaction is crucial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Froech, Olaf Wysocki, Yan Xia, Junyu Xie, Benedikt Schwab, Daniel Cremers, Thomas H. Kolbe</p>
<p>Abstract: High-detail semantic 3D building models are frequently utilized in robotics, geoinformatics, and computer vision. One key aspect of creating such models is employing 2D conflict maps that detect openings' locations in building facades. Yet, in reality, these maps are often incomplete due to obstacles encountered during laser scanning. To address this challenge, we introduce FacaDiffy, a novel method for inpainting unseen facade parts by completing conflict maps with a personalized Stable Diffusion model. Specifically, we first propose a deterministic ray analysis approach to derive 2D conflict maps from existing 3D building models and corresponding laser scanning point clouds. Furthermore, we facilitate the inpainting of unseen facade objects into these 2D conflict maps by leveraging the potential of personalizing a Stable Diffusion model. To complement the scarcity of real-world training data, we also develop a scalable pipeline to produce synthetic conflict maps using random city model generators and annotated facade images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FacaDiffy achieves state-of-the-art performance in conflict map completion compared to various inpainting baselines and increases the detection rate by $22\%$ when applying the completed conflict maps for high-definition 3D semantic building reconstruction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Heakl, Abdullah Sohail, Mukul Ranjan, Rania Hossam, Ghazi Ahmed, Mohamed El-Geish, Omar Maher, Zhiqiang Shen, Fahad Khan, Salman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in document processing, robust text recognition has become increasingly critical for knowledge extraction. While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models (such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts, numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection. This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap with English OCR technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Lange, Max Hamilton, Elijah Cole, Alexander Shepard, Samuel Heinrich, Angela Zhu, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowing where a particular species can or cannot be found on Earth is crucial for ecological research and conservation efforts. By mapping the spatial ranges of all species, we would obtain deeper insights into how global biodiversity is affected by climate change and habitat loss. However, accurate range estimates are only available for a relatively small proportion of all known species. For the majority of the remaining species, we often only have a small number of records denoting the spatial locations where they have previously been observed. We outline a new approach for few-shot species range estimation to address the challenge of accurately estimating the range of a species from limited data. During inference, our model takes a set of spatial locations as input, along with optional metadata such as text or an image, and outputs a species encoding that can be used to predict the range of a previously unseen species in feed-forward manner. We validate our method on two challenging benchmarks, where we obtain state-of-the-art range estimation performance, in a fraction of the compute time, compared to recent alternative approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyuan Liu, Yun-Yun Tsai, Ruijian Zha, Victoria Li, Pengyuan Shi, Chengzhi Mao, Junfeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive achievements of generative models in creating high-quality videos have raised concerns about digital integrity and privacy vulnerabilities. Recent works of AI-generated content detection have been widely studied in the image field (e.g., deepfake), yet the video field has been unexplored. Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) has become an emerging tool for AI-generated content detection for its strong reasoning and multimodal capabilities. It breaks the limitations of traditional deep learning based methods faced with like lack of transparency and inability to recognize new artifacts. Motivated by this, we propose LAVID, a novel LVLMs-based ai-generated video detection with explicit knowledge enhancement. Our insight list as follows: (1) The leading LVLMs can call external tools to extract useful information to facilitate its own video detection task; (2) Structuring the prompt can affect LVLM's reasoning ability to interpret information in video content. Our proposed pipeline automatically selects a set of explicit knowledge tools for detection, and then adaptively adjusts the structure prompt by self-rewriting. Different from prior SOTA that trains additional detectors, our method is fully training-free and only requires inference of the LVLM for detection. To facilitate our research, we also create a new benchmark \vidfor with high-quality videos generated from multiple sources of video generation tools. Evaluation results show that LAVID improves F1 scores by 6.2 to 30.2% over the top baselines on our datasets across four SOTA LVLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Measuring the accuracy of face recognition (FR) systems is essential for improving performance and ensuring responsible use. Accuracy is typically estimated using large annotated datasets, which are costly and difficult to obtain. We propose a novel method for 1:1 face verification that benchmarks FR systems quickly and without manual annotation, starting from approximate labels (e.g., from web search results). Unlike previous methods for training set label cleaning, ours leverages the embedding representation of the models being evaluated, achieving high accuracy in smaller-sized test datasets. Our approach reliably estimates FR accuracy and ranking, significantly reducing the time and cost of manual labeling. We also introduce the first public benchmark of five FR cloud services, revealing demographic biases, particularly lower accuracy for Asian women. Our rapid test method can democratize FR testing, promoting scrutiny and responsible use of the technology. Our method is provided as a publicly accessible tool at https://github.com/caltechvisionlab/frt-rapid-test</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object understanding has gained significant attention, yet current approaches often assume complete data availability and rigid alignment across all modalities. We present CrossOver, a novel framework for cross-modal 3D scene understanding via flexible, scene-level modality alignment. Unlike traditional methods that require aligned modality data for every object instance, CrossOver learns a unified, modality-agnostic embedding space for scenes by aligning modalities - RGB images, point clouds, CAD models, floorplans, and text descriptions - with relaxed constraints and without explicit object semantics. Leveraging dimensionality-specific encoders, a multi-stage training pipeline, and emergent cross-modal behaviors, CrossOver supports robust scene retrieval and object localization, even with missing modalities. Evaluations on ScanNet and 3RScan datasets show its superior performance across diverse metrics, highlighting adaptability for real-world applications in 3D scene understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a simple enhancement to the global processing of vision transformers (ViTs) to improve accuracy while maintaining throughput. Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K at high speeds (by 3.2% for ViT-tiny and 13.5% for ViT-nano); these Jumbo models even outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs. Although Jumbo sees no gains for ViT-small on ImageNet-1K, it gains 3.4% on ImageNet-21K over ViT+Registers. Both findings indicate that Jumbo is most helpful when the ViT is otherwise too narrow for the task. Finally, we show that Jumbo can be easily adapted to excel on data beyond images, e.g., time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyun Yi, Qingfeng Liu, Mostafa El-Khamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p>

While prior work focuses on mitigating hallucinations, we instead explore leveraging hallucination correction as a training objective to improve video-language alignment. We introduce HACA, a self-training framework learning to correct hallucinations in descriptions that do not align with the video content. By identifying and correcting inconsistencies, HACA enhances the model's ability to align video and textual representations for spatio-temporal reasoning. Our experimental results show consistent gains in video-caption binding and text-to-video retrieval tasks, demonstrating that hallucination correction-inspired tasks serve as an effective strategy for improving vision and language alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahid Ullah, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based cardiac segmentation has seen significant advancements over the years. Many studies have tackled the challenge of anatomically incorrect segmentation predictions by introducing auxiliary modules. These modules either post-process segmentation outputs or enforce consistency between specific points to ensure anatomical correctness. However, such approaches often increase network complexity, require separate training for these modules, and may lack robustness in scenarios with poor visibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture that leverages dense associative networks to learn and retain specific patterns inherent to cardiac inputs. Unlike traditional methods, our approach restricts the network to memorize a limited set of patterns. During forward propagation, a weighted sum of these patterns is used to enforce anatomical correctness in the output. Since these patterns are input-independent, the model demonstrates enhanced robustness, even in cases with poor visibility. The proposed pipeline was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, CAMUS and CardiacNet. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently outperforms baseline approaches across all metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and reliability for cardiac segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuwei Chen, Sihao Lin, Xiao Dong, Zisheng Chen, Meng Cao, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have been favored in both uni-modal and multi-modal foundation models for their flexible scalability in attention modules. Consequently, a number of pre-trained Transformer models, e.g., LLaVA, CLIP, and DEIT, are publicly available. Recent research has introduced subquadratic architectures like Mamba, which enables global awareness with linear complexity. Nevertheless, training specialized subquadratic architectures from scratch for certain tasks is both resource-intensive and time-consuming. As a motivator, we explore cross-architecture training to transfer the ready knowledge in existing Transformer models to alternative architecture Mamba, termed TransMamba. Our approach employs a two-stage strategy to expedite training new Mamba models, ensuring effectiveness in across uni-modal and cross-modal tasks. Concerning architecture disparities, we project the intermediate features into an aligned latent space before transferring knowledge. On top of that, a Weight Subcloning and Adaptive Bidirectional distillation method (WSAB) is introduced for knowledge transfer without limitations on varying layer counts. For cross-modal learning, we propose a cross-Mamba module that integrates language awareness into Mamba's visual features, enhancing the cross-modal interaction capabilities of Mamba architecture. Despite using less than 75% of the training data typically required for training from scratch, TransMamba boasts substantially stronger performance across various network architectures and downstream tasks, including image classification, visual question answering, and text-video retrieval. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebenezer Tarubinga, Jenifer Kalafatovich Espinoza</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation performance by utilising unlabeled data alongside limited labeled samples. Existing SSSS methods often face challenges such as coupling, where over-reliance on initial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where incorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused by insufficient boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge information. To address these issues, we propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact of incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels. Additionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being extensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) remain under-explored in SSSS. Specifically, our approach: (1) reduces coupling through a confidence-weighted loss function that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labels based on their predicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic thresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model performance, (3) resolves boundary blur with a boundary-aware module that enhances segmentation accuracy near object boundaries, and (4) reduces label noise with a confidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during training. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, using only 1/8 or 12.5\% of labeled data, our method achieves a mIoU of 75.81 on Pascal VOC 2012, highlighting its effectiveness in limited-label settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengwei Zhao, Xinyu Wang, Zhuo Zheng, Jingtao Li, Yanfei Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) open-set classification is critical for HSI classification models deployed in real-world environments, where classifiers must simultaneously classify known classes and reject unknown classes. Recent methods utilize auxiliary unknown classes data to improve classification performance. However, the auxiliary unknown classes data is strongly assumed to be completely separable from known classes and requires labor-intensive annotation. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework, HOpenCls, to leverage the unlabeled wild data-that is the mixture of known and unknown classes. Such wild data is abundant and can be collected freely during deploying classifiers in their living environments. The key insight is reformulating the open-set HSI classification with unlabeled wild data as a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning problem. Specifically, the multi-label strategy is introduced to bridge the PU learning and open-set HSI classification, and then the proposed gradient contraction and gradient expansion module to make this PU learning problem tractable from the observation of abnormal gradient weights associated with wild data. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that incorporating wild data has the potential to significantly enhance open-set HSI classification in complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuan Cui, Kejiang Chen, Zhihua Wei, Wen Shen, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated image (AGI) models has introduced significant challenges in evaluating their quality, which requires considering multiple dimensions such as perceptual quality, prompt correspondence, and authenticity. To address these challenges, we propose M3-AGIQA, a comprehensive framework for AGI quality assessment that is Multimodal, Multi-Round, and Multi-Aspect. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as joint text and image encoders and distills advanced captioning capabilities from online MLLMs into a local model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. The framework includes a structured multi-round evaluation mechanism, where intermediate image descriptions are generated to provide deeper insights into the quality, correspondence, and authenticity aspects. To align predictions with human perceptual judgments, a predictor constructed by an xLSTM and a regression head is incorporated to process sequential logits and predict Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs). Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M3-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively capturing nuanced aspects of AGI quality. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation confirms its strong generalizability. The code is available at https://github.com/strawhatboy/M3-AGIQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Mahara, Naphtali Rishe</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have primarily focused on deepfake detection and often lack coverage of recent advancements in synthetic image detection, particularly methods leveraging multimodal frameworks for improved forensic analysis. To address this gap, the present survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. This review systematically examines core detection methodologies, identifies commonalities among approaches, and categorizes them into meaningful taxonomies. Furthermore, given the crucial role of large-scale datasets in this field, we present an overview of publicly available datasets that facilitate further research and benchmarking in synthetic data detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thoa Thieu, Roderick Melnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial landmark tracking plays a vital role in applications such as facial recognition, expression analysis, and medical diagnostics. In this paper, we consider the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in tracking 3D facial motion in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We first analyze a noise-free environment where the state transition is purely deterministic, demonstrating that UKF outperforms EKF by achieving lower mean squared error (MSE) due to its ability to capture higher-order nonlinearities. However, when stochastic noise is introduced, EKF exhibits superior robustness, maintaining lower mean square error (MSE) compared to UKF, which becomes more sensitive to measurement noise and occlusions. Our results highlight that UKF is preferable for high-precision applications in controlled environments, whereas EKF is better suited for real-world scenarios with unpredictable noise. These findings provide practical insights for selecting the appropriate filtering technique in 3D facial tracking applications, such as motion capture and facial recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junliang Chen, Huaiyuan Xu, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting variations in complex traffic environments is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent advancements in occupancy forecasting have enabled forecasting future 3D occupied status in driving environments by observing historical 2D images. However, high computational demands make occupancy forecasting less efficient during training and inference stages, hindering its feasibility for deployment on edge agents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, i.e., OccProphet, to efficiently and effectively learn occupancy forecasting with significantly lower computational requirements while improving forecasting accuracy. OccProphet comprises three lightweight components: Observer, Forecaster, and Refiner. The Observer extracts spatio-temporal features from 3D multi-frame voxels using the proposed Efficient 4D Aggregation with Tripling-Attention Fusion, while the Forecaster and Refiner conditionally predict and refine future occupancy inferences. Experimental results on nuScenes, Lyft-Level5, and nuScenes-Occupancy datasets demonstrate that OccProphet is both training- and inference-friendly. OccProphet reduces 58\%$\sim$78\% of the computational cost with a 2.6$\times$ speedup compared with the state-of-the-art Cam4DOcc. Moreover, it achieves 4\%$\sim$18\% relatively higher forecasting accuracy. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JLChen-C/OccProphet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoying Hao, Yan Hu, Yang Yue, Li Wu, Huazhu Fu, Jinming Duan, Jiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: A comprehensive and explicit understanding of surgical scenes plays a vital role in developing context-aware computer-assisted systems in the operating theatre. However, few works provide systematical analysis to enable hierarchical surgical scene understanding. In this work, we propose to represent the tasks set [phase recognition --> step recognition --> action and instrument detection] as multi-level semantic scene understanding (MSSU). For this target, we propose a novel hierarchical context transformer (HCT) network and thoroughly explore the relations across the different level tasks. Specifically, a hierarchical relation aggregation module (HRAM) is designed to concurrently relate entries inside multi-level interaction information and then augment task-specific features. To further boost the representation learning of the different tasks, inter-task contrastive learning (ICL) is presented to guide the model to learn task-wise features via absorbing complementary information from other tasks. Furthermore, considering the computational costs of the transformer, we propose HCT+ to integrate the spatial and temporal adapter to access competitive performance on substantially fewer tunable parameters. Extensive experiments on our cataract dataset and a publicly available endoscopic PSI-AVA dataset demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, consistently exceeding the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yang, Lisheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised deep learning usually faces more challenges in medical images than in natural images. Since annotations in medical images require the expertise of doctors and are more time-consuming and expensive. Thus, some researchers turn to unsupervised learning methods, which usually face inevitable performance drops. In addition, medical images may have been acquired at different medical centers with different scanners and under different image acquisition protocols, so the modalities of the medical images are often inconsistent. This modality difference (domain shift) also reduces the applicability of deep learning methods. In this regard, we propose an unsupervised crossmodality domain adaptation method based on image translation by transforming the source modality image with annotation into the unannotated target modality and using its annotation to achieve supervised learning of the target modality. In addition, the subtle differences between translated pseudo images and real images are overcome by self-training methods to further improve the task performance of deep learning. The proposed method showed mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) of $0.8351 \pm 0.1152$ and $1.6712 \pm 2.1948$ for vestibular schwannoma (VS), $0.8098 \pm 0.0233$ and $0.2317 \pm 0.1577$ for cochlea on the VS and cochlea segmentation task of the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA 2022) challenge validation phase leaderboard.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15199">UrbanSAM: Learning Invariance-Inspired Adapters for Segment Anything Models in Urban Construction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Danfeng Hong, Bing Zhang, Yuxuan Li, Gustau Camps-Valls, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Jocelyn Chanussot</p>
<p>Abstract: Object extraction and segmentation from remote sensing (RS) images is a critical yet challenging task in urban environment monitoring. Urban morphology is inherently complex, with irregular objects of diverse shapes and varying scales. These challenges are amplified by heterogeneity and scale disparities across RS data sources, including sensors, platforms, and modalities, making accurate object segmentation particularly demanding. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown significant potential in segmenting complex scenes, its performance in handling form-varying objects remains limited due to manual-interactive prompting. To this end, we propose UrbanSAM, a customized version of SAM specifically designed to analyze complex urban environments while tackling scaling effects from remotely sensed observations. Inspired by multi-resolution analysis (MRA) theory, UrbanSAM incorporates a novel learnable prompter equipped with a Uscaling-Adapter that adheres to the invariance criterion, enabling the model to capture multiscale contextual information of objects and adapt to arbitrary scale variations with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, features from the Uscaling-Adapter and the trunk encoder are aligned through a masked cross-attention operation, allowing the trunk encoder to inherit the adapter's multiscale aggregation capability. This synergy enhances the segmentation performance, resulting in more powerful and accurate outputs, supported by the learned adapter. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the flexibility and superior segmentation performance of the proposed UrbanSAM on a global-scale dataset, encompassing scale-varying urban objects such as buildings, roads, and water.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, methods that integrate multiple personalized concepts into a single image have garnered significant attention in the field of text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods experience performance degradation in complex scenes with multiple objects due to distortions in non-personalized regions. To address this issue, we propose FlipConcept, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates multiple personalized concepts into a single image without requiring additional tuning. We introduce guided appearance attention to accurately mimic the appearance of a personalized concept as intended. Additionally, we introduce mask-guided noise mixing to protect non-personalized regions during editing. Lastly, we apply background dilution to minimize attribute leakage, which is the undesired blending of personalized concept attributes with other objects in the image. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not requiring tuning, outperforms existing models in both single and multiple personalized concept inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ocean front is defined as the interface between different water masses and plays a vital role in the evolution of many physical phenomena. Previous detection methods are based on histogram, Lyapunov exponent, gradient and machine learning. These algorithms, however, introduce discontinuity, inaccuracy, use less information or just approaching traditional results. Moreover, automatic front tracking algrorithm is not open source in preceding studies. This paper foucuses on large-scale ocean fronts and proposes an automatic front detection and tracking algorithm based on Bayesian decision and metric space. In this, front merging, filling and ring deletion are put forward to enhance continuity. The distance between fronts in different days is firstly defined and is well-defined in metric space for functional analysis. These technologies can be migrated to other areas of computer vision such as edge detection and tracking.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework for pre-training of 3D hand pose estimation from in-the-wild hand images sharing with similar hand characteristics, dubbed SimHand. Pre-training with large-scale images achieves promising results in various tasks, but prior methods for 3D hand pose pre-training have not fully utilized the potential of diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild videos. To facilitate scalable pre-training, we first prepare an extensive pool of hand images from in-the-wild videos and design our pre-training method with contrastive learning. Specifically, we collect over 2.0M hand images from recent human-centric videos, such as 100DOH and Ego4D. To extract discriminative information from these images, we focus on the similarity of hands: pairs of non-identical samples with similar hand poses. We then propose a novel contrastive learning method that embeds similar hand pairs closer in the feature space. Our method not only learns from similar samples but also adaptively weights the contrastive learning loss based on inter-sample distance, leading to additional performance gains. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that produce positive pairs sorely from a single image with data augmentation. We achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method (PeCLR) in various datasets, with gains of 15% on FreiHand, 10% on DexYCB, and 4% on AssemblyHands.

<p>Abstract: The fast growing application of omnidirectional images calls for effective approaches for omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA). Existing OIQA methods have been developed and tested on homogeneously distorted omnidirectional images, but it is hard to transfer their success directly to the heterogeneously distorted omnidirectional images. In this paper, we conduct the largest study so far on OIQA, where we establish a large-scale database called OIQ-10K containing 10,000 omnidirectional images with both homogeneous and heterogeneous distortions. A comprehensive psychophysical study is elaborated to collect human opinions for each omnidirectional image, together with the spatial distributions (within local regions or globally) of distortions, and the head and eye movements of the subjects. Furthermore, we propose a novel multitask-derived adaptive feature-tailoring OIQA model named IQCaption360, which is capable of generating a quality caption for an omnidirectional image in a manner of textual template. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IQCaption360, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on the proposed OIQ-10K database.

<p>Abstract: Assessing whether AI-generated images are substantially similar to copyrighted works is a crucial step in resolving copyright disputes. In this paper, we propose CopyJudge, an automated copyright infringement identification framework that leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) to simulate practical court processes for determining substantial similarity between copyrighted images and those generated by text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we employ an abstraction-filtration-comparison test framework with multi-LVLM debate to assess the likelihood of infringement and provide detailed judgment rationales. Based on the judgments, we further introduce a general LVLM-based mitigation strategy that automatically optimizes infringing prompts by avoiding sensitive expressions while preserving the non-infringing content. Besides, our approach can be enhanced by exploring non-infringing noise vectors within the diffusion latent space via reinforcement learning, even without modifying the original prompts. Experimental results show that our identification method achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance, while offering superior generalization and interpretability across various forms of infringement, and that our mitigation method could more effectively mitigate memorization and IP infringement without losing non-infringing expressions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic counting soybean pods and seeds in outdoor fields allows for rapid yield estimation before harvesting, while indoor laboratory counting offers greater accuracy. Both methods can significantly accelerate the breeding process. However, it remains challenging for accurately counting pods and seeds in outdoor fields, and there are still no accurate enough tools for counting pods and seeds in laboratories. In this study, we developed efficient deep learning models for counting soybean pods and seeds in both outdoor fields and indoor laboratories. For outdoor fields, annotating not only visible seeds but also occluded seeds makes YOLO have the ability to estimate the number of soybean seeds that are occluded. Moreover, we enhanced YOLO architecture by integrating it with HQ-SAM (YOLO-SAM), and domain adaptation techniques (YOLO-DA), to improve model robustness and generalization across soybean images taken in outdoor fields. Testing on soybean images from the outdoor field, we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.13 for pod counting and 10.05 for seed counting. For the indoor setting, we utilized Mask-RCNN supplemented with a Swin Transformer module (Mask-RCNN-Swin), models were trained exclusively on synthetic training images generated from a small set of labeled data. This approach resulted in near-perfect accuracy, with an MAE of 1.07 for pod counting and 1.33 for seed counting across actual laboratory images from two distinct studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfei Shi, Mengmeng Nie, Weisi Lin, Haiyan Jin, Junhuai Li, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning is an effective end-to-end method for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar(PolSAR) image classification, but it lacks the guidance of related mathematical principle and is essentially a black-box model. In addition, existing deep models learn features in Euclidean space, where PolSAR complex matrix is commonly converted into a complex-valued vector as the network input, distorting matrix structure and channel relationship. However, the complex covariance matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), and resides on a Riemannian manifold instead of a Euclidean one. Existing methods cannot measure the geometric distance of HPD matrices and easily cause some misclassifications due to inappropriate Euclidean measures. To address these issues, we propose a novel Riemannian Sparse Representation Learning Network (SRSR CNN) for PolSAR images. Firstly, a superpixel-based Riemannian Sparse Representation (SRSR) model is designed to learn the sparse features with Riemannian metric. Then, the optimization procedure of the SRSR model is inferred and further unfolded into an SRSRnet, which can automatically learn the sparse coefficients and dictionary atoms. Furthermore, to learn contextual high-level features, a CNN-enhanced module is added to improve classification performance. The proposed network is a Sparse Representation (SR) guided deep learning model, which can directly utilize the covariance matrix as the network input, and utilize Riemannian metric to learn geometric structure and sparse features of complex matrices in Riemannian space. Experiments on three real PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in ensuring accurate edge details and correct region homogeneity for classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traffic signs recognition (TSR) plays an essential role in assistant driving and intelligent transportation system. However, the noise of complex environment may lead to motion-blur or occlusion problems, which raise the tough challenge to real-time recognition with high accuracy and robust. In this article, we propose IECES-network which with improved encoders and Siamese net. The three-stage approach of our method includes Efficient-CNN based encoders, Siamese backbone and the fully-connected layers. We firstly use convolutional encoders to extract and encode the traffic sign features of augmented training samples and standard images. Then, we design the Siamese neural network with Efficient-CNN based encoder and contrastive loss function, which can be trained to improve the robustness of TSR problem when facing the samples of motion-blur and occlusion by computing the distance between inputs and templates. Additionally, the template branch of the proposed network can be stopped when executing the recognition tasks after training to raise the process speed of our real-time model, and alleviate the computational resource and parameter scale. Finally, we recombined the feature code and a fully-connected layer with SoftMax function to classify the codes of samples and recognize the category of traffic signs. The results of experiments on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset demonstrate the performance of the proposed IECESnetwork. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, in the case of motion-blur and occluded environment, the proposed method achieves competitive performance precision-recall and accuracy metric average is 88.1%, 86.43% and 86.1% with a 2.9M lightweight scale, respectively. Moreover, processing time of our model is 0.1s per frame, of which the speed is increased by 1.5 times compared with existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Feng, Shulan Ruan, Mingzheng Yang, Dongxuan Han, Huijie Liu, Kai Zhang, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As more and more internet users post images online to express their daily emotions, image sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention. Recently, researchers generally tend to design different neural networks to extract visual features from images for sentiment analysis. Despite the significant progress, metadata, the data (e.g., text descriptions and keyword tags) for describing the image, has not been sufficiently explored in this task. In this paper, we propose a novel Metadata Enhanced Transformer for sentiment analysis (SentiFormer) to fuse multiple metadata and the corresponding image into a unified framework. Specifically, we first obtain multiple metadata of the image and unify the representations of diverse data. To adaptively learn the appropriate weights for each metadata, we then design an adaptive relevance learning module to highlight more effective information while suppressing weaker ones. Moreover, we further develop a cross-modal fusion module to fuse the adaptively learned representations and make the final prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueting Liu, Hanshi Wang, Yunfei Lei, Zhengjun Zha, Weiming Hu, Jin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving perception have revealed exceptional capabilities within structured environments dominated by vehicular traffic. However, current perception models exhibit significant limitations in semi-structured environments, where dynamic pedestrians with more diverse irregular movement and occlusion prevail. We attribute this shortcoming to the scarcity of high-quality datasets in semi-structured scenes, particularly concerning pedestrian perception and prediction. In this work, we present the multi-modal Pedestrian-Focused Scene Dataset(PFSD), rigorously annotated in semi-structured scenes with the format of nuScenes. PFSD provides comprehensive multi-modal data annotations with point cloud segmentation, detection, and object IDs for tracking. It encompasses over 130,000 pedestrian instances captured across various scenarios with varying densities, movement patterns, and occlusions. Furthermore, to demonstrate the importance of addressing the challenges posed by more diverse and complex semi-structured environments, we propose a novel Hybrid Multi-Scale Fusion Network (HMFN). Specifically, to detect pedestrians in densely populated and occluded scenarios, our method effectively captures and fuses multi-scale features using a meticulously designed hybrid framework that integrates sparse and vanilla convolutions. Extensive experiments on PFSD demonstrate that HMFN attains improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over existing methods, thereby underscoring its efficacy in addressing the challenges of 3D pedestrian detection in complex semi-structured environments. Coding and benchmark are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibum Kim, Kanghoon Yoon, Yeonjun In, Jaehyeong Jeon, Jinyoung Moon, Donghyun Kim, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) studies are trained in a fully supervised manner, which requires all frames in a video to be annotated, thereby incurring high annotation cost compared to Image Scene Graph Generation (ImgSGG). Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting a weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses image captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1) Temporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions include temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time related details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human actions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying duration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video Scene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily available video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two key modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action Duration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically, TCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order based on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence with appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our approach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply applying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a further benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show that the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of action classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our framework practical in reality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matvey Skripkin, Elizaveta Goncharova, Dmitrii Tarasov, Andrey Kuznetsov</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) integrate visual and textual information by coupling a vision encoder with a large language model through the specific adapter. While existing approaches commonly rely on a single pre-trained vision encoder, there is a great variability of specialized encoders that can boost model's performance in distinct domains. In this work, we propose MOVE (Mixture of Vision Encoders) a simple yet effective approach to leverage multiple pre-trained encoders for specialized multimodal tasks. MOVE automatically routes inputs to the most appropriate encoder among candidates such as Unichat, InternViT, and Texify, thereby enhancing performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including ChartQA, MMBench, and MMMU. Experimental results demonstrate that MOVE achieves competitive accuracy without incurring the complexities of image slicing for high-resolution images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchen Wei, Zhihong Tan, Yaosi Hu, Changwen Chen, Zhenzhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable performance in video understanding tasks and can even process videos longer than one hour. However, despite their ability to handle long inputs, generating outputs with corresponding levels of richness remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the issue of long outputs in LMMs using video captioning as a proxy task, and we find that open-source LMMs struggle to consistently generate outputs exceeding about 300 words. Through controlled experiments, we find that the scarcity of paired examples with long-captions during training is the primary factor limiting the model's output length. However, manually annotating long-caption examples is time-consuming and expensive. To address this, we propose the LongCaption-Agent, a framework that synthesizes long caption data by aggregating multi-level descriptions. Using LongCaption-Agent, we curated a new long-caption dataset, LongCaption-10K. We also develop LongCaption-Bench, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the quality of long captions generated by LMMs. By incorporating LongCaption-10K into training, we enable LMMs to generate captions exceeding 1,000 words, while maintaining high output quality. In LongCaption-Bench, our 8B parameter model achieved state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing larger proprietary models. We will release the dataset and code after publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Narges Semiromizadeh, Omid Nejati Manzari, Shahriar B. Shokouhi, Sattar Mirzakuchaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is a crucial component of the Intelligent Transport System, garnering significant attention in recent years. VMMR has been widely utilized for detecting suspicious vehicles, monitoring urban traffic, and autonomous driving systems. The complexity of VMMR arises from the subtle visual distinctions among vehicle models and the wide variety of classes produced by manufacturers. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a prominent type of deep learning model, have been extensively employed in various computer vision tasks, including VMMR, yielding remarkable results. As VMMR is a fine-grained classification problem, it primarily faces inter-class similarity and intra-class variation challenges. In this study, we implement an attention module to address these challenges and enhance the model's focus on critical areas containing distinguishing features. This module, which does not increase the parameters of the original model, generates three-dimensional (3-D) attention weights to refine the feature map. Our proposed model integrates the attention module into two different locations within the middle section of a convolutional model, where the feature maps from these sections offer sufficient information about the input frames without being overly detailed or overly coarse. The performance of our proposed model, along with state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional and transformer-based models, was evaluated using the Stanford Cars dataset. Our proposed model achieved the highest accuracy, 90.69\%, among the compared models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengcheng Yu, Haoran Xu, Canming Xia, Guang Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based occupancy networks provide an end-to-end solution for reconstructing the surrounding environment using semantic occupied voxels derived from multi-view images. This technique relies on effectively learning the correlation between pixel-level visual information and voxels. Despite recent advancements, occupancy results still suffer from limited accuracy due to occlusions and sparse visual cues. To address this, we propose a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation (LEAP)} method, which significantly enhances the performance of existing occupancy networks with minimal computational overhead. LEAP can be seamlessly integrated into various baseline networks, enabling a plug-and-play application. LEAP operates in three stages: 1) it tokenizes information from recent baseline and motion features into a shared, compact latent space; 2) it establishes full correlation through a tri-stream fusion architecture; 3) it generates occupancy results that strengthen the baseline's output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, outperforming the latest baseline models. The source code and several demos are available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Koch, Marian Schl\"uter, J\"org Kr\"uger</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MVIP, a novel dataset for multi-modal and multi-view application-oriented industrial part recognition. Here we are the first to combine a calibrated RGBD multi-view dataset with additional object context such as physical properties, natural language, and super-classes. The current portfolio of available datasets offers a wide range of representations to design and benchmark related methods. In contrast to existing classification challenges, industrial recognition applications offer controlled multi-modal environments but at the same time have different problems than traditional 2D/3D classification challenges. Frequently, industrial applications must deal with a small amount or increased number of training data, visually similar parts, and varying object sizes, while requiring a robust near 100% top 5 accuracy under cost and time constraints. Current methods tackle such challenges individually, but direct adoption of these methods within industrial applications is complex and requires further research. Our main goal with MVIP is to study and push transferability of various state-of-the-art methods within related downstream tasks towards an efficient deployment of industrial classifiers. Additionally, we intend to push with MVIP research regarding several modality fusion topics, (automated) synthetic data generation, and complex data sampling -- combined in a single application-oriented benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gengyuan Zhang, Mingcong Ding, Tong Liu, Yao Zhang, Volker Tresp</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in understanding videos holistically, yet their ability to process streaming videos-videos are treated as a sequence of visual events-remains underexplored. Intuitively, leveraging past events as memory can enrich contextual and temporal understanding of the current event. In this paper, we show that leveraging memories as contexts helps MLLMs better understand video events. However, because such memories rely on predictions of preceding events, they may contain misinformation, leading to confabulation and degraded performance. To address this, we propose a confabulation-aware memory modification method that mitigates confabulated memory for memory-enhanced event understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremie Ochin, Guillaume Devineau, Bogdan Stanciulescu, Sotiris Manitsaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Soccer analytics rely on two data sources: the player positions on the pitch and the sequences of events they perform. With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Dehui Wang, Zhiteng Li, Zheng Chen, Yong Guo, Wenbo Li, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-bit model quantization for image super-resolution (SR) is a longstanding task that is renowned for its surprising compression and acceleration ability. However, accuracy degradation is inevitable when compressing the full-precision (FP) model to ultra-low bit widths (2~4 bits). Experimentally, we observe that the degradation of quantization is mainly attributed to the quantization of activation instead of model weights. In numerical analysis, the condition number of weights could measure how much the output value can change for a small change in the input argument, inherently reflecting the quantization error. Therefore, we propose CondiQuant, a condition number based low-bit post-training quantization for image super-resolution. Specifically, we formulate the quantization error as the condition number of weight metrics. By decoupling the representation ability and the quantization sensitivity, we design an efficient proximal gradient descent algorithm to iteratively minimize the condition number and maintain the output still. With comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CondiQuant outperforms existing state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods in accuracy without computation overhead and gains the theoretically optimal compression ratio in model parameters.

<p>Abstract: The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is an essential tool to capture the complex interaction of light and matter. Recently, several works have employed neural methods for BRDF modeling, following various strategies, ranging from utilizing existing parametric models to purely neural parametrizations. While all methods yield impressive results, a comprehensive comparison of the different approaches is missing in the literature. In this work, we present a thorough evaluation of several approaches, including results for qualitative and quantitative reconstruction quality and an analysis of reciprocity and energy conservation. Moreover, we propose two extensions that can be added to existing approaches: A novel additive combination strategy for neural BRDFs that split the reflectance into a diffuse and a specular part, and an input mapping that ensures reciprocity exactly by construction, while previous approaches only ensure it by soft constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alistair Weld, Luke Dixon, Alfie Roddan, Giulio Anichini, Sophie Camp, Stamatia Giannarou</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: An investigation of the challenge of annotating discrete segmentations of brain tumours in ultrasound, with a focus on the issue of aleatoric uncertainty along the tumour margin, particularly for diffuse tumours. A segmentation protocol and method is proposed that incorporates this margin-related uncertainty while minimising the interobserver variance through reduced subjectivity, thereby diminishing annotator epistemic uncertainty. Approach: A sparse confidence method for annotation is proposed, based on a protocol designed using computer vision and radiology theory. Results: Output annotations using the proposed method are compared with the corresponding professional discrete annotation variance between the observers. A linear relationship was measured within the tumour margin region, with a Pearson correlation of 0.8. The downstream application was explored, comparing training using confidence annotations as soft labels with using the best discrete annotations as hard labels. In all evaluation folds, the Brier score was superior for the soft-label trained network. Conclusion: A formal framework was constructed to demonstrate the infeasibility of discrete annotation of brain tumours in B-mode ultrasound. Subsequently, a method for sparse confidence-based annotation is proposed and evaluated. Keywords: Brain tumours, ultrasound, confidence, annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangyong Yu, Changyong Shu, Dawei Yang, Zichen Yu, Xing Hu, Yan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: PETR-based methods have dominated benchmarks in 3D perception and are increasingly becoming a key component in modern autonomous driving systems. However, their quantization performance significantly degrades when INT8 inference is required, with a degradation of 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. To address this issue, we propose a quantization-aware position embedding transformation for multi-view 3D object detection, termed Q-PETR. Q-PETR offers a quantizationfriendly and deployment-friendly architecture while preserving the original performance of PETR. It substantially narrows the accuracy gap between INT8 and FP32 inference for PETR-series methods. Without bells and whistles, our approach reduces the mAP and NDS drop to within 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Furthermore, our method exceeds the performance of the original PETR in terms of floating-point precision. Extensive experiments across a variety of PETR-series models demonstrate its broad generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Sun, Yeqiang Qian, Chunxiang Wang, Ming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety and reliability are crucial for the public acceptance of autonomous driving. To ensure accurate and reliable environmental perception, intelligent vehicles must exhibit accuracy and robustness in various environments. Millimeter-wave radar, known for its high penetration capability, can operate effectively in adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. Traditional 3D millimeter-wave radars can only provide range, Doppler, and azimuth information for objects. Although the recent emergence of 4D millimeter-wave radars has added elevation resolution, the radar point clouds remain sparse due to Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) operations. In contrast, cameras offer rich semantic details but are sensitive to lighting and weather conditions. Hence, this paper leverages these two highly complementary and cost-effective sensors, 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera. By integrating 4D radar spectra with depth-aware camera images and employing attention mechanisms, we fuse texture-rich images with depth-rich radar data in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective, enhancing 3D object detection. Additionally, we propose using GAN-based networks to generate depth images from radar spectra in the absence of depth sensors, further improving detection accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: This project explores the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Transformers, to the task of vehicle speed estimation using video data. Traditional methods of speed estimation, such as radar and manual systems, are often constrained by high costs, limited coverage, and potential disruptions. In contrast, leveraging existing surveillance infrastructure and cutting-edge neural network architectures presents a non-intrusive, scalable solution. Our approach utilizes LSTM and GRU to effectively manage long-term dependencies within the temporal sequence of video frames, while Transformers are employed to harness their self-attention mechanisms, enabling the processing of entire sequences in parallel and focusing on the most informative segments of the data. This study demonstrates that both LSTM and GRU outperform basic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) due to their advanced gating mechanisms. Furthermore, increasing the sequence length of input data consistently improves model accuracy, highlighting the importance of contextual information in dynamic environments. Transformers, in particular, show exceptional adaptability and robustness across varied sequence lengths and complexities, making them highly suitable for real-time applications in diverse traffic conditions. The findings suggest that integrating these sophisticated neural network models can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated speed detection systems, thus promising to revolutionize traffic management and road safety.</p>

While existing VLM benchmarks provide general insights into model capabilities, their heterogeneous designs and limited focus on a few imaging domains pose significant challenges for both cross-domain performance comparison and targeted domain-specific evaluation. To address this, we propose three key contributions: (1) a framework for the resource-efficient creation of domain-specific VLM benchmarks enabled by task augmentation for creating multiple diverse tasks from a single existing task, (2) the release of new VLM benchmarks for seven domains, created according to the same homogeneous protocol and including 162,946 thoroughly human-validated answers, and (3) an extensive benchmarking of 22 state-of-the-art VLMs on a total of 37,171 tasks, revealing performance variances across domains and tasks, thereby supporting the need for tailored VLM benchmarks. Adoption of our methodology will pave the way for the resource-efficient domain-specific selection of models and guide future research efforts toward addressing core open questions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing photorealistic virtual worlds has applications across various fields, but it often requires the extensive labor of highly trained professionals to operate conventional 3D modeling software. To democratize this process, we introduce WorldCraft, a system where large language model (LLM) agents leverage procedural generation to create indoor and outdoor scenes populated with objects, allowing users to control individual object attributes and the scene layout using intuitive natural language commands. In our framework, a coordinator agent manages the overall process and works with two specialized LLM agents to complete the scene creation: ForgeIt, which integrates an ever-growing manual through auto-verification to enable precise customization of individual objects, and ArrangeIt, which formulates hierarchical optimization problems to achieve a layout that balances ergonomic and aesthetic considerations. Additionally, our pipeline incorporates a trajectory control agent, allowing users to animate the scene and operate the camera through natural language interactions. Our system is also compatible with off-the-shelf deep 3D generators to enrich scene assets. Through evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the versatility of WorldCraft, ranging from single-object customization to intricate, large-scale interior and exterior scene designs. This system empowers non-professionals to bring their creative visions to life.</p>

<p>Abstract: Person identification is important for smart buildings to provide personalized services such as health monitoring, activity tracking, and personnel management. However, previous person identification relies on pre-collected data from everyone, which is impractical in many buildings and public facilities in which visitors are typically expected. This calls for a continual person identification system that gradually learns people's identities on the fly. Existing studies use cameras to achieve this goal, but they require direct line-of-sight and also have raised privacy concerns in public. Other modalities such as wearables and pressure mats are limited by the requirement of device-carrying or dense deployment. Thus, prior studies introduced footstep-induced structural vibration sensing, which is non-intrusive and perceived as more privacy-friendly. However, this approach has a significant challenge: the high variability of vibration data due to structural heterogeneity and human gait variations, which makes online person identification algorithms perform poorly. In this paper, we characterize the variability in footstep-induced structural vibration data for accurate online person identification. To achieve this, we quantify and decompose different sources of variability and then design a feature transformation function to reduce the variability within each person's data to make different people's data more separable. We evaluate our approach through field experiments with 20 people. The results show a 70% variability reduction and a 90% accuracy for online person identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Yu, Chong Cheng, Yifan Zhou, Xiaojun Yang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM, as it can produce high-fidelity novel views. However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqian Ni, Sicong Du, Zhenghua Hou, Chenming Wu, Sheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To evaluate end-to-end autonomous driving systems, a simulation environment based on Novel View Synthesis (NVS) techniques is essential, which synthesizes photo-realistic images and point clouds from previously recorded sequences under new vehicle poses, particularly in cross-lane scenarios. Therefore, the development of a multi-lane dataset and benchmark is necessary. While recent synthetic scene-based NVS datasets have been prepared for cross-lane benchmarking, they still lack the realism of captured images and point clouds. To further assess the performance of existing methods based on NeRF and 3DGS, we present the first multi-lane dataset registering parallel scans specifically for novel driving view synthesis dataset derived from real-world scans, comprising 25 groups of associated sequences, including 16,000 front-view images, 64,000 surround-view images, and 16,000 LiDAR frames. All frames are labeled to differentiate moving objects from static elements. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches in various testing scenarios at different lanes and distances. Additionally, our method provides the solution for solving and assessing the quality of multi-sensor poses for multi-modal data alignment for curating such a dataset in real-world. We plan to continually add new sequences to test the generalization of existing methods across different scenarios. The dataset is released publicly at the project page: https://nizqleo.github.io/paralane-dataset/.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the potential of large-scale generative video models for autonomous driving, introducing an open-source auto-regressive video model (VaViM) and its companion video-action model (VaVAM) to investigate how video pre-training transfers to real-world driving. VaViM is a simple auto-regressive video model that predicts frames using spatio-temporal token sequences. We show that it captures the semantics and dynamics of driving scenes. VaVAM, the video-action model, leverages the learned representations of VaViM to generate driving trajectories through imitation learning. Together, the models form a complete perception-to-action pipeline. We evaluate our models in open- and closed-loop driving scenarios, revealing that video-based pre-training holds promise for autonomous driving. Key insights include the semantic richness of the learned representations, the benefits of scaling for video synthesis, and the complex relationship between model size, data, and safety metrics in closed-loop evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanqi Zhan, Yuanpei Liu, Kai Han, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective in this paper is to improve the performance of text-to-image retrieval. To this end, we introduce a new framework that can boost the performance of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, so that they can be used for text-to-image re-ranking. The approach, Enhanced Language-Image Pre-training (ELIP), uses the text query to predict a set of visual prompts to condition the ViT image encoding. ELIP can easily be applied to the commonly used CLIP/SigLIP and the state-of-the-art BLIP-2 architectures. To train the architecture with limited computing resources, we develop a 'student friendly' best practice involving global hard sample mining, and selection and curation of a large-scale dataset. On the evaluation side, we set up two new out-of-distribution benchmarks, Occluded COCO and ImageNet-R, to assess the zero-shot generalisation of the models to different domains. Benefiting from the novel architecture and data curation, experiments show our enhanced network significantly boosts CLIP/SigLIP performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art BLIP-2 model on text-to-image retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyue Liang, Taihui Li, Ju Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Image watermarks have been considered a promising technique to help detect AI-generated content, which can be used to protect copyright or prevent fake image abuse. In this work, we present a black-box method for removing invisible image watermarks, without the need of any dataset of watermarked images or any knowledge about the watermark system. Our approach is simple to implement: given a single watermarked image, we regress it by deep image prior (DIP). We show that from the intermediate steps of DIP one can reliably find an evasion image that can remove invisible watermarks while preserving high image quality. Due to its unique working mechanism and practical effectiveness, we advocate including DIP as a baseline invasion method for benchmarking the robustness of watermarking systems. Finally, by showing the limited ability of DIP and other existing black-box methods in evading training-based visible watermarks, we discuss the positive implications on the practical use of training-based visible watermarks to prevent misinformation abuse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasun Roy, Saumik Bhattacharya, Subhankar Ghosh, Umapada Pal, Michael Blumenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural guidance in an image-to-image translation allows intricate control over the shapes of synthesized images. Generating high-quality realistic images from user-specified rough hand-drawn sketches is one such task that aims to impose a structural constraint on the conditional generation process. While the premise is intriguing for numerous use cases of content creation and academic research, the problem becomes fundamentally challenging due to substantial ambiguities in freehand sketches. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between shape consistency and realistic generation contributes to additional complexity in the process. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally utilize conditional GANs or GAN inversions, often requiring application-specific data and optimization objectives. The recent introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieves a generational leap for low-level visual attributes in general image synthesis. However, directly retraining a large-scale diffusion model on a domain-specific subtask is often extremely difficult due to demanding computation costs and insufficient data. In this paper, we introduce a technique for sketch-to-image translation by exploiting the feature generalization capabilities of a large-scale diffusion model without retraining. In particular, we use a learnable lightweight mapping network to achieve latent feature translation from source to target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in qualitative and quantitative benchmarks, allowing high-resolution realistic image synthesis from rough hand-drawn sketches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hemant Kumar Aggarwal, Antony Jerald, Phaneendra K. Yalavarthy, Rajesh Langoju, Bipul Das</p>
<p>Abstract: In X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, the choice of reconstruction kernel is crucial as it significantly impacts the quality of clinical images. Different kernels influence spatial resolution, image noise, and contrast in various ways. Clinical applications involving lung imaging often require images reconstructed with both soft and sharp kernels. The reconstruction of images with different kernels requires raw sinogram data and storing images for all kernels increases processing time and storage requirements. The Display Field-of-View (DFOV) adds complexity to kernel synthesis, as data acquired at different DFOVs exhibit varying levels of sharpness and details. This work introduces an efficient, DFOV-agnostic solution for image-based kernel synthesis using model-based deep learning. The proposed method explicitly integrates CT kernel and DFOV characteristics into the forward model. Experimental results on clinical data, along with quantitative analysis of the estimated modulation transfer function using wire phantom data, clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in real-time. Additionally, a comparative study with a direct learning network, that lacks forward model information, shows that the proposed method is more robust to DFOV variations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Until now, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, lung diseases, especially diseases such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have become an urgent global health issue. In order to mitigate the goal problem, early detection and accurate diagnosis of these conditions are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. To further research and reduce the error rate of hospital diagnoses, this comprehensive study explored the potential of computer-aided design (CAD) systems, especially utilizing advanced deep learning models such as U-Net. And compared with the literature content of other authors, this study explores the capabilities of U-Net in detail, and enhances the ability to simulate CAD systems through the VGG16 algorithm. An extensive dataset consisting of lung CT images and corresponding segmentation masks, curated collaboratively by multiple academic institutions, serves as the basis for empirical validation. In this paper, the efficiency of U-Net model is evaluated rigorously and precisely under multiple hardware configurations, such as single CPU, single GPU, distributed GPU and federated learning, and the effectiveness and development of the method in the segmentation task of lung disease are demonstrated. Empirical results clearly affirm the robust performance of the U-Net model, most effectively utilizing four GPUs for distributed learning, and these results highlight the potential of U-Net-based CAD systems for accurate and timely lung disease detection and diagnosis huge potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kejie Chen, Xiaochun Yang, Jing Na, Wenbo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used to study vascular structures and micro-circulation dynamics in the retina and choroid. OCTA has been widely used in clinics for diagnosing ocular disease and monitoring its progression, because OCTA is safer and faster than dye-based angiography while retaining the ability to characterize micro-scale structures. However, OCTA data contains many inherent noises from the devices and acquisition protocols and suffers from various types of artifacts, which impairs diagnostic accuracy and repeatability. Deep learning (DL) based imaging analysis models are able to automatically detect and remove artifacts and noises, and enhance the quality of image data. It is also a powerful tool for segmentation and identification of normal and pathological structures in the images. Thus, the value of OCTA imaging can be significantly enhanced by the DL-based approaches for interpreting and performing measurements and predictions on the OCTA data. In this study, we reviewed literature on the DL models for OCTA images in the latest five years. In particular, we focused on discussing the current problems in the OCTA data and the corresponding design principles of the DL models. We also reviewed the state-of-art DL models for 3D volumetric reconstruction of the vascular networks and pathological structures such as the edema and distorted optic disc. In addition, the publicly available dataset of OCTA images are summarized at the end of this review. Overall, this review can provide valuable insights for engineers to develop novel DL models by utilizing the characteristics of OCTA signals and images. The pros and cons of each DL methods and their applications discussed in this review can be helpful to assist technicians and clinicians to use proper DL models for fundamental research and disease screening.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research studies the impact of high-quality training datasets on the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in detecting strong gravitational lenses. We stress the importance of data diversity and representativeness, demonstrating how variations in sample populations influence CNN performance. In addition to the quality of training data, our results highlight the effectiveness of various techniques, such as data augmentation and ensemble learning, in reducing false positives while maintaining model completeness at an acceptable level. This enhances the robustness of gravitational lens detection models and advancing capabilities in this field. Our experiments, employing variations of DenseNet and EfficientNet, achieved a best false positive rate (FP rate) of $10^{-4}$, while successfully identifying over 88 per cent of genuine gravitational lenses in the test dataset. This represents an 11-fold reduction in the FP rate compared to the original training dataset. Notably, this substantial enhancement in the FP rate is accompanied by only a 2.3 per cent decrease in the number of true positive samples. Validated on the KiDS dataset, our findings offer insights applicable to ongoing missions, like Euclid.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayman A. Ameen, Thomas Richter, Andr\'e Kaup</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image compression models often require separate models for each quality level, making them resource-intensive in terms of both training and storage. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes latent variables from pre-existing trained models (such as the Stable Diffusion Variational Autoencoder) for perceptual image compression. Our method eliminates the need for distinct models dedicated to different quality levels. We employ overfitted learnable functions to compress the latent representation from the target model at any desired quality level. These overfitted functions operate in the latent space, ensuring low computational complexity, around $25.5$ MAC/pixel for a forward pass on images with dimensions $(1363 \times 2048)$ pixels. This approach efficiently utilizes resources during both training and decoding. Our method achieves comparable perceptual quality to state-of-the-art learned image compression models while being both model-agnostic and resolution-agnostic. This opens up new possibilities for the development of innovative image compression methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In order to make a pinpoint landing on the Moon, the spacecraft's navigation system must be accurate. To achieve the desired accuracy, navigational drift caused by the inertial sensors must be corrected. One way to correct this drift is to use absolute navigation solutions. In this study, a terrain absolute navigation method to estimate the spacecraft's position and attitude is proposed. This algorithm uses the position of the craters below the spacecraft for estimation. Craters seen by the camera onboard the spacecraft are detected and identified using a crater database known beforehand. In order to focus on estimation algorithms, image processing and crater matching steps are skipped. The accuracy of the algorithm and the effect of the crater number used for estimation are inspected by performing simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nastaran Darabi, Devashri Naik, Sina Tayebati, Dinithi Jayasuriya, Ranganath Krishnan, Amit Ranjan Trivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inherit adversarial vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are further exacerbated by their multimodal nature. Existing defenses, including adversarial training, input transformations, and heuristic detection, are computationally expensive, architecture-dependent, and fragile against adaptive attacks. We introduce EigenShield, an inference-time defense leveraging Random Matrix Theory to quantify adversarial disruptions in high-dimensional VLM representations. Unlike prior methods that rely on empirical heuristics, EigenShield employs the spiked covariance model to detect structured spectral deviations. Using a Robustness-based Nonconformity Score (RbNS) and quantile-based thresholding, it separates causal eigenvectors, which encode semantic information, from correlational eigenvectors that are susceptible to adversarial artifacts. By projecting embeddings onto the causal subspace, EigenShield filters adversarial noise without modifying model parameters or requiring adversarial training. This architecture-independent, attack-agnostic approach significantly reduces the attack success rate, establishing spectral analysis as a principled alternative to conventional defenses. Our results demonstrate that EigenShield consistently outperforms all existing defenses, including adversarial training, UNIGUARD, and CIDER.</p>

<p>Abstract: For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization accuracy, the lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we replace the traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in sampling frequency with mmWave radar within the ground platform setup, and introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system designed for drone landings. To fully leverage the \textit{temporal consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these modalities, we propose two innovative modules, \textit{consistency-instructed collaborative tracking} and \textit{graph-informed adaptive joint optimization}, for accurate drone measurement extraction and efficient sensor fusion. Extensive real-world experiments in landing scenarios from a leading drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and latency.</p>

Our evaluation results show that even state-of-the-art LMM (like OpenAI-o1) can correct their results through human feedback less than 50%.

<p>Abstract: This work introduces the design, implementation, and validation of a virtual reality (VR) experience aimed at promoting the inclusion of individuals with dyslexia in university settings. Unlike traditional awareness methods, this immersive approach offers a novel way to foster empathy by allowing participants to experience firsthand the challenges faced by students with dyslexia. Specifically, the experience raises awareness by exposing non-dyslexic individuals to the difficulties commonly encountered by dyslexic students. In the virtual environment, participants explore a virtual campus with multiple buildings, navigating between them while completing tasks and simultaneously encountering barriers that simulate some of the challenges faced by individuals with dyslexia. These barriers include reading signs with shifting letters, following directional arrows that may point incorrectly, and dealing with a lack of assistance. The campus is a comprehensive model featuring both indoor and outdoor spaces and supporting various modes of locomotion. To validate the experience, more than 30 non-dyslexic participants from the university environment, mainly professors and students, evaluated it through ad hoc satisfaction surveys. The results indicated heightened awareness of the barriers encountered by students with dyslexia, with participants deeming the experience a valuable tool for increasing visibility and fostering understanding of dyslexic students.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Zhuo, Mohamad Najafi, Hazem Zein, Amine Nait-Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a specialized pipeline designed to classify the concentration state of an individual student during online learning sessions by training a custom-tailored machine learning model. Detailed protocols for acquiring and preprocessing EEG data are outlined, along with the extraction of fifty statistical features from five EEG signal bands: alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma. Following feature extraction, a thorough feature selection process was conducted to optimize the data inputs for a personalized analysis. The study also explores the benefits of hyperparameter fine-tuning to enhance the classification accuracy of the student's concentration state. EEG signals were captured from the student using a Muse headband (Gen 2), equipped with five electrodes (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10, and a reference electrode NZ), during engagement with educational content on computer-based e-learning platforms. Employing a random forest model customized to the student's data, we achieved remarkable classification performance, with test accuracies of 97.6% in the computer-based learning setting and 98% in the virtual reality setting. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in delivering personalized insights into student concentration during online educational activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Sheng, Zilin Huang, Yansong Qu, Yue Leng, Sruthi Bhavanam, Sikai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling rare but potentially catastrophic safety-critical scenarios. While existing research has explored generating safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing, there is limited work on effectively incorporating these scenarios into policy learning to enhance safety. Furthermore, developing training curricula that adapt to an AV's evolving behavioral patterns and performance bottlenecks remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose CurricuVLM, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable personalized curriculum learning for autonomous driving agents. Our approach uniquely exploits VLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities to analyze agent behavior, identify performance weaknesses, and dynamically generate tailored training scenarios for curriculum adaptation. Through comprehensive analysis of unsafe driving situations with narrative descriptions, CurricuVLM performs in-depth reasoning to evaluate the AV's capabilities and identify critical behavioral patterns. The framework then synthesizes customized training scenarios targeting these identified limitations, enabling effective and personalized curriculum learning. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset show that CurricuVLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across both regular and safety-critical scenarios, achieving superior performance in terms of navigation success, driving efficiency, and safety metrics. Further analysis reveals that CurricuVLM serves as a general approach that can be integrated with various RL algorithms to enhance autonomous driving systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ach Khozaimi, Isnani Darti, Syaiful Anam, Wuryansari Muharini Kusumawinahyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pap smear image quality is crucial for cervical cancer detection. This study introduces an optimized hybrid approach that combines the Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) filter with contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to enhance Pap smear image quality. The PMD filter reduces the image noise, whereas CLAHE improves the image contrast. The hybrid method was optimized using spider monkey optimization (SMO PMD-CLAHE). BRISQUE and CEIQ are the new objective functions for the PMD filter and CLAHE optimization, respectively. The simulations were conducted using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The results indicate that SMO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the PMD filter and CLAHE. The proposed method achieved an average effective measure of enhancement (EME) of 5.45, root mean square (RMS) contrast of 60.45, Michelson's contrast (MC) of 0.995, and entropy of 6.80. This approach offers a new perspective for improving Pap smear image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Jiang, Hui Yuan, Shuai Li, Huanqiang Zeng, Sam Kwong</p>
<p>Abstract: The learned image compression (LIC) methods have already surpassed traditional techniques in compressing natural scene (NS) images. However, directly applying these methods to screen content (SC) images, which possess distinct characteristics such as sharp edges, repetitive patterns, embedded text and graphics, yields suboptimal results. This paper addresses three key challenges in SC image compression: learning compact latent features, adapting quantization step sizes, and the lack of large SC datasets. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel compression method that employs a multi-frequency two-stage octave residual block (MToRB) for feature extraction, a cascaded triple-scale feature fusion residual block (CTSFRB) for multi-scale feature integration and a multi-frequency context interaction module (MFCIM) to reduce inter-frequency correlations. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive quantization module that learns scaled uniform noise for each frequency component, enabling flexible control over quantization granularity. Furthermore, we construct a large SC image compression dataset (SDU-SCICD10K), which includes over 10,000 images spanning basic SC images, computer-rendered images, and mixed NS and SC images from both PC and mobile platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves SC image compression performance, outperforming traditional standards and state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM).</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial task in computer vision aimed to enhance the visual fidelity of images captured under low-illumination conditions. Conventional methods frequently struggle to mitigate pervasive shortcomings such as noise, over-exposure, and color distortion thereby precipitating a pronounced degradation in image quality. To address these challenges, we propose LUMINA-Net an advanced deep learning framework designed specifically by integrating multi-stage illumination and reflectance modules. First, the illumination module intelligently adjusts brightness and contrast levels while meticulously preserving intricate textural details. Second, the reflectance module incorporates a noise reduction mechanism that leverages spatial attention and channel-wise feature refinement to mitigate noise contamination. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments conducted on LOL and SICE datasets using PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS metrics, surpassing state-of-the-art methodologies and showcasing its efficacy in low-light image enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Jiang, Hui Yuan, Shuai Li, Raouf Hamzaoui, Xu Wang, Junyan Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression (LIC) methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, obtaining a more compact latent representation and reducing the impact of quantization errors remain key challenges in the field of LIC. To address these challenges, we propose a feature extraction module, a feature refinement module, and a feature enhancement module. Our feature extraction module shuffles the pixels in the image, splits the resulting image into sub-images, and extracts coarse features from the sub-images. Our feature refinement module stacks the coarse features and uses an attention refinement block composed of concatenated three-dimensional convolution residual blocks to learn more compact latent features by exploiting correlations across channels, within sub-images (intra-sub-image correlations), and across sub-images (inter-sub-image correlations). Our feature enhancement module reduces information loss in the decoded features following quantization. We also propose a quantization error compensation module that mitigates the quantization mismatch between training and testing. Our four modules can be readily integrated into state-of-the-art LIC methods. Experiments show that combining our modules with Tiny-LIC outperforms existing LIC methods and image compression standards in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) on the Kodak dataset and the CLIC dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Jiang, Yannick Lemar\'echal, Jos\'ee Bafaro, Jessica Abi-Rjeile, Philippe Joubert, Philippe Despr\'es, Venkata Manem</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a dice coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8\% and 18.6\% improvements in DICE and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hinako Asaoka, Kazue Kudo</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. While the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is suitable for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum-era hardware, its learning process relies heavily on classical computation. Future large-scale, gate-based quantum computers could unlock the full potential of quantum effects in machine learning. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) structures on classification performance. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy, and we provide an analysis of their effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning, a departure from hybrid approaches such as QCNN.</p>

Furthermore, we also introduce BharatBench, a comprehensive framework for evaluating VLMs across various Indian languages, ultimately contributing to more diverse and effective AI systems. Our model achieves SOTA results for benchmarks across low resource languages while retaining its efficiency in English.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgii Kolokolnikov, Marie-Lena Schmalhofer, Lennart Well, Said Farschtschi, Victor-Felix Mautner, Inka Ristow, Rene Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of neurofibromas (NFs), which exhibit significant variability in size, morphology, and anatomical location. Accurate and automated segmentation of these tumors in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is crucial to assess tumor burden and monitor disease progression. In this study, we present and analyze a fully automated pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed T2-weighted WB-MRI, consisting of three stages: anatomy segmentation, NF segmentation, and tumor candidate classification. In the first stage, we use the MRSegmentator model to generate an anatomy segmentation mask, extended with a high-risk zone for NFs. This mask is concatenated with the input image as anatomical context information for NF segmentation. The second stage employs an ensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets to produce an NF segmentation confidence mask. In the final stage, tumor candidates are extracted from the confidence mask and classified based on radiomic features, distinguishing tumors from non-tumor regions and reducing false positives. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three test sets representing different conditions: in-domain data (test set 1), varying imaging protocols and field strength (test set 2), and low tumor burden cases (test set 3). Experimental results show a 68% improvement in per-scan Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), a 21% increase in per-tumor DSC, and a two-fold improvement in F1 score for tumor detection in high tumor burden cases by integrating anatomy information. The method is integrated into the 3D Slicer platform for practical clinical use, with the code publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufeng Diao, Yichi Zhang, Changyang She, Philip Guodong Zhao, Emma Liying Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the receiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Raina</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which estimate the full posterior distribution over model parameters, are well-known for their role in uncertainty quantification and its promising application in out-of-distribution detection (OoD). Amongst other uncertainty measures, BNNs provide a state-of-the art estimation of predictive entropy (total uncertainty) which can be decomposed as the sum of mutual information and expected entropy. In the context of OoD detection the estimation of predictive uncertainty in the form of the predictive entropy score confounds aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, the latter being hypothesized to be high for OoD points. Despite these justifications, the mutual information score has been shown to perform worse than predictive entropy. Taking inspiration from Bayesian variational autoencoder (BVAE) literature, this work proposes to measure the disagreement between a corrected version of the pre-softmax quantities, otherwise known as logits, as an estimate of epistemic uncertainty for Bayesian NNs under mean field variational inference. The three proposed epistemic uncertainty scores demonstrate marked improvements over mutual information on a range of OoD experiments, with equal performance otherwise. Moreover, the epistemic uncertainty scores perform on par with the Bayesian benchmark predictive entropy on a range of MNIST and CIFAR10 experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yang, Linfeng Zhao, Mingyu Ding, Gedas Bertasius, Daniel Szafir</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotics has long sought to develop visual-servoing robots capable of completing previously unseen long-horizon tasks. Hierarchical approaches offer a pathway for achieving this goal by executing skill combinations arranged by a task planner, with each visuomotor skill pre-trained using a specific imitation learning (IL) algorithm. However, even in simple long-horizon tasks like skill chaining, hierarchical approaches often struggle due to a problem we identify as Observation Space Shift (OSS), where the sequential execution of preceding skills causes shifts in the observation space, disrupting the performance of subsequent individually trained skill policies. To validate OSS and evaluate its impact on long-horizon tasks, we introduce BOSS (a Benchmark for Observation Space Shift). BOSS comprises three distinct challenges: "Single Predicate Shift", "Accumulated Predicate Shift", and "Skill Chaining", each designed to assess a different aspect of OSS's negative effect. We evaluated several recent popular IL algorithms on BOSS, including three Behavioral Cloning methods and the Visual Language Action model OpenVLA. Even on the simplest challenge, we observed average performance drops of 67%, 35%, 34%, and 54%, respectively, when comparing skill performance with and without OSS. Additionally, we investigate a potential solution to OSS that scales up the training data for each skill with a larger and more visually diverse set of demonstrations, with our results showing it is not sufficient to resolve OSS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Xu, Weili Nie, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders their practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation, which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current state-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renjie Wei, Zechun Liu, Yuchen Fan, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks for image super-resolution (SR) have demonstrated superior performance. However, the large memory and computation consumption hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binary neural networks (BNNs), which quantize the floating point weights and activations to 1-bit can significantly reduce the cost. Although BNNs for image classification have made great progress these days, existing BNNs for SR still suffer from a large performance gap between the FP SR networks. To this end, we observe the activation distribution in SR networks and find much larger pixel-to-pixel, channel-to-channel, layer-to-layer, and image-to-image variation in the activation distribution than image classification networks. However, existing BNNs for SR fail to capture these variations that contain rich information for image reconstruction, leading to inferior performance. To address this problem, we propose SCALES, a binarization method for SR networks that consists of the layer-wise scaling factor, the spatial re-scaling method, and the channel-wise re-scaling method, capturing the layer-wise, pixel-wise, and channel-wise variations efficiently in an input-dependent manner. We evaluate our method across different network architectures and datasets. For CNN-based SR networks, our binarization method SCALES outperforms the prior art method by 0.2dB with fewer parameters and operations. With SCALES, we achieve the first accurate binary Transformer-based SR network, improving PSNR by more than 1dB compared to the baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingda Yin, Jiangran Lyu, Yang Wang, Haoran Liu, He Wang, Baoquan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the 3DoF rotation from a single RGB image is an important yet challenging problem. As a popular approach, probabilistic rotation modeling additionally carries prediction uncertainty information, compared to single-prediction rotation regression. For modeling probabilistic distribution over SO(3), it is natural to use Gaussian-like Bingham distribution and matrix Fisher, however they are shown to be sensitive to outlier predictions, e.g. $180^\circ$ error and thus are unlikely to converge with optimal performance. In this paper, we draw inspiration from multivariate Laplace distribution and propose a novel rotation Laplace distribution on SO(3). Our rotation Laplace distribution is robust to the disturbance of outliers and enforces much gradient to the low-error region that it can improve. In addition, we show that our method also exhibits robustness to small noises and thus tolerates imperfect annotations. With this benefit, we demonstrate its advantages in semi-supervised rotation regression, where the pseudo labels are noisy. To further capture the multi-modal rotation solution space for symmetric objects, we extend our distribution to rotation Laplace mixture model and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our extensive experiments show that our proposed distribution and the mixture model achieve state-of-the-art performance in all the rotation regression experiments over both probabilistic and non-probabilistic baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongda Liu, Yunlong Wang, Min Ren, Junxing Hu, Zhengquan Luo, Guangqi Hou, Zhenan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has recently made significant progress. However, data imbalance is still a great challenge in real-world scenarios. The performance of current action recognition algorithms declines sharply when training data suffers from heavy class imbalance. The imbalanced data actually degrades the representations learned by these methods and becomes the bottleneck for action recognition. How to learn unbiased representations from imbalanced action data is the key to long-tailed action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel balanced representation learning method to address the long-tailed problem in action recognition. Firstly, a spatial-temporal action exploration strategy is presented to expand the sample space effectively, generating more valuable samples in a rebalanced manner. Secondly, we design a detached action-aware learning schedule to further mitigate the bias in the representation space. The schedule detaches the representation learning of tail classes from training and proposes an action-aware loss to impose more effective constraints. Additionally, a skip-modal representation is proposed to provide complementary structural information. The proposed method is validated on four skeleton datasets, NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA, and Kinetics. It not only achieves consistently large improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also demonstrates a superior generalization capacity through extensive experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Xue, Nenglun Chen, Jun Liu, Wenyun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot 3D part segmentation is a challenging and fundamental task. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, ZeroPS, which achieves high-quality knowledge transfer from 2D pretrained foundation models (FMs), SAM and GLIP, to 3D object point clouds. We aim to explore the natural relationship between multi-view correspondence and the FMs' prompt mechanism and build bridges on it. In ZeroPS, the relationship manifests as follows: 1) lifting 2D to 3D by leveraging co-viewed regions and SAM's prompt mechanism, 2) relating 1D classes to 3D parts by leveraging 2D-3D view projection and GLIP's prompt mechanism, and 3) enhancing prediction performance by leveraging multi-view observations. Extensive evaluations on the PartNetE and AKBSeg benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroPS significantly outperforms the SOTA method across zero-shot unlabeled and instance segmentation tasks. ZeroPS does not require additional training or fine-tuning for the FMs. ZeroPS applies to both simulated and real-world data. It is hardly affected by domain shift.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Xu, Cuiling Lan, Wenxuan Xie, Xuejin Chen, Yan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Our experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dezhao Luo, Shaogang Gong, Jiabo Huang, Hailin Jin, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video moment retrieval (VMR) aims to locate the most likely video moment(s) corresponding to a text query in untrimmed videos. Training of existing methods is limited by the lack of diverse and generalisable VMR datasets, hindering their ability to generalise moment-text associations to queries containing novel semantic concepts (unseen both visually and textually in a training source domain). For model generalisation to novel semantics, existing methods rely heavily on assuming to have access to both video and text sentence pairs from a target domain in addition to the source domain pair-wise training data. This is neither practical nor scalable. In this work, we introduce a more generalisable approach by assuming only text sentences describing new semantics are available in model training without having seen any videos from a target domain. To that end, we propose a Fine-grained Video Editing framework, termed FVE, that explores generative video diffusion to facilitate fine-grained video editing from the seen source concepts to the unseen target sentences consisting of new concepts. This enables generative hypotheses of unseen video moments corresponding to the novel concepts in the target domain. This fine-grained generative video diffusion retains the original video structure and subject specifics from the source domain while introducing semantic distinctions of unseen novel vocabularies in the target domain. A critical challenge is how to enable this generative fine-grained diffusion process to be meaningful in optimising VMR, more than just synthesising visually pleasing videos. We solve this problem by introducing a hybrid selection mechanism that integrates three quantitative metrics to selectively incorporate synthetic video moments (novel video hypotheses) as enlarged additions to the original source training data, whilst minimising potential ...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yurui Chen, Junge Zhang, Ziyang Xie, Wenye Li, Feihu Zhang, Jiachen Lu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving simulation system plays a crucial role in enhancing self-driving data and simulating complex and rare traffic scenarios, ensuring navigation safety. However, traditional simulation systems, which often heavily rely on manual modeling and 2D image editing, struggled with scaling to extensive scenes and generating realistic simulation data. In this study, we present S-NeRF++, an innovative autonomous driving simulation system based on neural reconstruction. Trained on widely-used self-driving datasets such as nuScenes and Waymo, S-NeRF++ can generate a large number of realistic street scenes and foreground objects with high rendering quality as well as offering considerable flexibility in manipulation and simulation. Specifically, S-NeRF++ is an enhanced neural radiance field for synthesizing large-scale scenes and moving vehicles, with improved scene parameterization and camera pose learning. The system effectively utilizes noisy and sparse LiDAR data to refine training and address depth outliers, ensuring high-quality reconstruction and novel-view rendering. It also provides a diverse foreground asset bank by reconstructing and generating different foreground vehicles to support comprehensive scenario creation.Moreover, we have developed an advanced foreground-background fusion pipeline that skillfully integrates illumination and shadow effects, further enhancing the realism of our simulations. With the high-quality simulated data provided by our S-NeRF++, we found the perception methods enjoy performance boosts on several autonomous driving downstream tasks, further demonstrating our proposed simulator's effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Alkin, Lukas Miklautz, Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MIM (Masked Image Modeling)-Refiner, a contrastive learning boost for pre-trained MIM models. MIM-Refiner is motivated by the insight that strong representations within MIM models generally reside in intermediate layers. Accordingly, MIM-Refiner leverages multiple contrastive heads that are connected to different intermediate layers. In each head, a modified nearest neighbor objective constructs semantic clusters that capture semantic information which improves performance on downstream tasks, including off-the-shelf and fine-tuning settings.
  The refinement process is short and simple - yet highly effective. Within a few epochs, we refine the features of MIM models from subpar to state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf features. Refining a ViT-H, pre-trained with data2vec 2.0 on ImageNet-1K, sets a new state-of-the-art in linear probing (84.7%) and low-shot classification among models that are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. MIM-Refiner efficiently combines the advantages of MIM and ID objectives and compares favorably against previous state-of-the-art SSL models on a variety of benchmarks such as low-shot classification, long-tailed classification, clustering and semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Luo, Junlong Du, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Diffusion Models has dramatically improved image generation quality, making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and generated images. This development, while impressive, also raises significant privacy and security concerns. In response to this, we propose a novel Latent REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error (LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1% average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators. LaRE also surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction cost, delivering an impressive speed enhancement of 8 times. Code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayoub Karine, Thibault Napol\'eon, Maher Jridi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new knowledge distillation method tailored for image semantic segmentation, termed Intra- and Inter-Class Knowledge Distillation (I2CKD). The focus of this method is on capturing and transferring knowledge between the intermediate layers of teacher (cumbersome model) and student (compact model). For knowledge extraction, we exploit class prototypes derived from feature maps. To facilitate knowledge transfer, we employ a triplet loss in order to minimize intra-class variances and maximize inter-class variances between teacher and student prototypes. Consequently, I2CKD enables the student to better mimic the feature representation of the teacher for each class, thereby enhancing the segmentation performance of the compact network. Extensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and CamVid, using various teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel "auto-agglomerative" 3D fracture assembly method, PuzzleFusion++, resembling how humans solve challenging spatial puzzles. Starting from individual fragments, the approach 1) aligns and merges fragments into larger groups akin to agglomerative clustering and 2) repeats the process iteratively in completing the assembly akin to auto-regressive methods. Concretely, a diffusion model denoises the 6-DoF alignment parameters of the fragments simultaneously, and a transformer model verifies and merges pairwise alignments into larger ones, whose process repeats iteratively. Extensive experiments on the Breaking Bad dataset show that PuzzleFusion++ outperforms all other state-of-the-art techniques by significant margins across all metrics, in particular by over 10% in part accuracy and 50% in Chamfer distance.

<p>Abstract: Transformers are widely used as generic backbones in computer vision, despite initially introduced for natural language processing. Recently, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been extended to a scalable and performant architecture - the xLSTM - which overcomes long-standing LSTM limitations via exponential gating and parallelizable matrix memory structure. In this report, we introduce Vision-LSTM (ViL), an adaption of the xLSTM building blocks to computer vision. ViL comprises a stack of xLSTM blocks where odd blocks process the sequence of patch tokens from top to bottom while even blocks go from bottom to top. Experiments show that ViL holds promise to be further deployed as new generic backbone for computer vision architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in breast cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) faces challenges due to limited expert-labeled segmentations. To address this, we present a multicenter dataset of 1506 pre-treatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases, including expert annotations of primary tumors and non-mass-enhanced regions. The dataset integrates imaging data from four collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), where only 163 cases with expert segmentations were initially available. To facilitate the annotation process, a deep learning model was trained to produce preliminary segmentations for the remaining cases. These were subsequently corrected and verified by 16 breast cancer experts (averaging 9 years of experience), creating a fully annotated dataset. Additionally, the dataset includes 49 harmonized clinical and demographic variables, as well as pre-trained weights for a baseline nnU-Net model trained on the annotated data. This resource addresses a critical gap in publicly available breast cancer datasets, enabling the development, validation, and benchmarking of advanced deep learning models, thus driving progress in breast cancer diagnostics, treatment response prediction, and personalized care.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted the extension to the multimodal domain developing image-text Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and then video-text models. In this work, we investigate the challenge of contextual and temporal comprehension in video-language models by exploring the task of temporal localization in videos. To address this problem, prior works have developed complex task-specific architectures, novel modules to embed time into MLLMs, or leveraged additional input signals such as video transcripts to best encode contextual and temporal information. Interestingly, we find that most of these efforts are surpassed by a much simpler design. We introduce Chrono, a universal sequence blueprint that can be applied to an image-text pretrained MLLM. Through extensive ablations across different MLLM architectures, finetuning and zero-shot settings, and different datasets, we achieve a new SOTA in moment retrieval on the most widely used benchmarks Charades-STA, QVHighlights, ActivityNet Captions, and grounded video question answering on NeXT-GQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Gimeno-G\'omez, Carlos-D. Mart\'inez-Hinarejos</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) have led to unprecedented achievements in the field, improving the robustness of this type of system in adverse, noisy environments. In most cases, this task has been addressed through the design of models composed of two independent encoders, each dedicated to a specific modality. However, while recent works have explored unified audio-visual encoders, determining the optimal cross-modal architecture remains an ongoing challenge. Furthermore, such approaches often rely on models comprising vast amounts of parameters and high computational cost training processes. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing a novel audio-visual framework. Our proposed method constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to harness the flexibility and interpretability offered by encoder architectures, such as the Branchformer, in the design of parameter-efficient AVSR systems. To be more precise, the proposed framework consists of two steps: first, estimating audio- and video-only systems, and then designing a tailored audio-visual unified encoder based on the layer-level branch scores provided by the modality-specific models. Extensive experiments on English and Spanish AVSR benchmarks covering multiple data conditions and scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method. Even when trained on a moderate scale of data, our models achieve competitive word error rates (WER) of approximately 2.5\% for English and surpass existing approaches for Spanish, establishing a new benchmark with an average WER of around 9.1\%. These results reflect how our tailored AVSR system is able to reach state-of-the-art recognition rates while significantly reducing the model complexity w.r.t. the prevalent approach in the field.

<p>Abstract: With the development of eXtended Reality (XR), photo capturing and display technology based on head-mounted displays (HMDs) have experienced significant advancements and gained considerable attention. Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. The assessment for the Quality of Experience (QoE) of XR content is important to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images and the corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) under three display modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Based on our ESIQAD, we propose a novel mamba2-based multi-stage feature fusion model, termed ESIQAnet, which predicts the perceptual quality of egocentric spatial images under the three display modes. Specifically, we first extract features from multiple visual state space duality (VSSD) blocks, then apply cross attention to fuse binocular view information and use transposed attention to further refine the features. The multi-stage features are finally concatenated and fed into a quality regression network to predict the quality score. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ESIQAnet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art IQA models on the ESIQAD under all three display modes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Yang, Nan Song, Wei Li, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang, Philip H. S. Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing top-performance autonomous driving systems typically rely on the multi-modal fusion strategy for reliable scene understanding. This design is however fundamentally restricted due to overlooking the modality-specific strengths and finally hampering the model performance. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a novel modality interaction strategy that allows individual per-modality representations to be learned and maintained throughout, enabling their unique characteristics to be exploited during the whole perception pipeline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we design DeepInteraction++, a multi-modal interaction framework characterized by a multi-modal representational interaction encoder and a multi-modal predictive interaction decoder. Specifically, the encoder is implemented as a dual-stream Transformer with specialized attention operation for information exchange and integration between separate modality-specific representations. Our multi-modal representational learning incorporates both object-centric, precise sampling-based feature alignment and global dense information spreading, essential for the more challenging planning task. The decoder is designed to iteratively refine the predictions by alternately aggregating information from separate representations in a unified modality-agnostic manner, realizing multi-modal predictive interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on both 3D object detection and end-to-end autonomous driving tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjee Lee, Youngsik Yun, Jeongmin Bae, Seoha Kim, Youngjung Uh</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the 3D semantics of a scene is a fundamental problem for various scenarios such as embodied agents. While NeRFs and 3DGS excel at novel-view synthesis, previous methods for understanding their semantics have been limited to incomplete 3D understanding: their segmentation results are rendered as 2D masks that do not represent the entire 3D space. To address this limitation, we redefine the problem to segment the 3D volume and propose the following methods for better 3D understanding. We directly supervise the 3D points to train the language embedding field, unlike previous methods that anchor supervision at 2D pixels. We transfer the learned language field to 3DGS, achieving the first real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy. Lastly, we introduce a 3D querying and evaluation protocol for assessing the reconstructed geometry and semantics together. Code, checkpoints, and annotations are available at the project page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Tang, Meng Cao, Jinfa Huang, Ruyang Liu, Peng Jin, Ge Li, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to align and associate relevant video content with corresponding natural language queries. Most existing TVR methods are based on large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, due to the inherent plain structure of CLIP, few TVR methods explore the multi-scale representations which offer richer contextual information for a more thorough understanding. To this end, we propose MUSE, a multi-scale mamba with linear computational complexity for efficient cross-resolution modeling. Specifically, the multi-scale representations are generated by applying a feature pyramid on the last single-scale feature map. Then, we employ the Mamba structure as an efficient multi-scale learner to jointly learn scale-wise representations. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to investigate different model structures and designs. Extensive results on three popular benchmarks have validated the superiority of MUSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Yang, Jing Tan, Mengchen Zhang, Tong Wu, Yixuan Li, Gordon Wetzstein, Ziwei Liu, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D immersive scene generation is a challenging yet critical task in computer vision and graphics. A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Layerpano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. Layerpano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) We introduce a new panorama dataset Upright360, comprising 9k high-quality and upright panorama images, and finetune the advanced Flux model on Upright360 for high-quality, upright and consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that Layerpano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Obschonka, Christian Fisch, Tharindu Fernando, Clinton Fookes</p>
<p>Abstract: Occupational outcomes like entrepreneurship are generally considered personal information that individuals should have the autonomy to disclose. With the advancing capability of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer private details from widely available human-centric data (e.g., social media), it is crucial to investigate whether AI can accurately extract private occupational information from such data. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks can classify individuals as entrepreneurs with high accuracy based on facial images sourced from Crunchbase, a premier source for entrepreneurship data. Utilizing a dataset comprising facial images of 40,728 individuals, including both entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a contrastive learning approach based on pairs of facial images (one entrepreneur and one non-entrepreneur per pair). While human experts (n=650) and trained participants (n=133) were unable to classify entrepreneurs with accuracy above chance levels (>50%), our AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 79.51%. Several robustness tests indicate that this high level of accuracy is maintained under various conditions. These results indicate privacy risks for entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaobing Zheng, Yilun Xu, Weihai Chen, Shiqian Wu, Sen Zhang, Zhengguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to saturated regions of inputting low dynamic range (LDR) images and large intensity changes among the LDR images caused by different exposures, it is challenging to produce an information enriched panoramic LDR image without visual artifacts for a high dynamic range (HDR) scene through stitching multiple geometrically synchronized LDR images with different exposures and pairwise overlapping fields of views (OFOVs). Fortunately, the stitching of such images is innately a perfect scenario for the fusion of a physics-driven approach and a data-driven approach due to their OFOVs. Based on this new insight, a novel neural augmentation based panoramic HDR stitching algorithm is proposed in this paper. The physics-driven approach is built up using the OFOVs. Different exposed images of each view are initially generated by using the physics-driven approach, are then refined by a data-driven approach, and are finally used to produce panoramic LDR images with different exposures. All the panoramic LDR images with different exposures are combined together via a multi-scale exposure fusion algorithm to produce the final panoramic LDR image. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing panoramic stitching algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Gadirov, Jos B. T. M. Roerdink, Steffen Frey</p>
<p>Abstract: We present FLINT (learning-based FLow estimation and temporal INTerpolation), a novel deep learning-based approach to estimate flow fields for 2D+time and 3D+time scientific ensemble data. FLINT can flexibly handle different types of scenarios with (1) a flow field being partially available for some members (e.g., omitted due to space constraints) or (2) no flow field being available at all (e.g., because it could not be acquired during an experiment). The design of our architecture allows to flexibly cater to both cases simply by adapting our modular loss functions, effectively treating the different scenarios as flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised problems, respectively (with respect to the presence or absence of ground-truth flow). To the best of our knowledge, FLINT is the first approach to perform flow estimation from scientific ensembles, generating a corresponding flow field for each discrete timestep, even in the absence of original flow information. Additionally, FLINT produces high-quality temporal interpolants between scalar fields. FLINT employs several neural blocks, each featuring several convolutional and deconvolutional layers. We demonstrate performance and accuracy for different usage scenarios with scientific ensembles from both simulations and experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Sun, Jaesung Choe, Charles Loop, Wei-Chiu Ma, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on adaptive sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to adaptively and explicitly allocate sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details with $65536^3$ grid resolution while achieving high rendering frame rates. Second, we customize a rasterizer for efficient adaptive sparse voxels rendering. We render voxels in the correct depth order by using ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, which avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel model by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our voxel representation is seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing techniques such as Volume Fusion, Voxel Pooling, and Marching Cubes, enabling a wide range of future extensions and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yu, Song Xia, Xun Lin, Wenhan Yang, Shijian Lu, Yap-peng Tan, Alex Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), responsible for assessing the quality of a single input image without using any reference, plays a critical role in evaluating and optimizing computer vision systems, e.g., low-light enhancement. Recent research indicates that NR-IQA models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can significantly alter predicted scores with visually imperceptible perturbations. Despite revealing vulnerabilities, these attack methods have limitations, including high computational demands, untargeted manipulation, limited practical utility in white-box scenarios, and reduced effectiveness in black-box scenarios. To address these challenges, we shift our focus to another significant threat and present a novel poisoning-based backdoor attack against NR-IQA (BAIQA), allowing the attacker to manipulate the IQA model's output to any desired target value by simply adjusting a scaling coefficient $\alpha$ for the trigger. We propose to inject the trigger in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to improve the local invariance of the trigger for countering trigger diminishment in NR-IQA models due to widely adopted data augmentations. Furthermore, the universal adversarial perturbations (UAP) in the DCT space are designed as the trigger, to increase IQA model susceptibility to manipulation and improve attack effectiveness. In addition to the heuristic method for poison-label BAIQA (P-BAIQA), we explore the design of clean-label BAIQA (C-BAIQA), focusing on $\alpha$ sampling and image data refinement, driven by theoretical insights we reveal. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and various NR-IQA models demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks. Code can be found at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/BAIQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Zhong, Bin Chen, Hao Fang, Xulin Gu, Shu-Tao Xia, En-Hui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to minimize the time and memory consumption needed for training deep neural networks on large datasets, by creating a smaller synthetic dataset that has similar performance to that of the full real dataset. However, current dataset distillation methods often result in synthetic datasets that are excessively difficult for networks to learn from, due to the compression of a substantial amount of information from the original data through metrics measuring feature similarity, e,g., distribution matching (DM). In this work, we introduce conditional mutual information (CMI) to assess the class-aware complexity of a dataset and propose a novel method by minimizing CMI. Specifically, we minimize the distillation loss while constraining the class-aware complexity of the synthetic dataset by minimizing its empirical CMI from the feature space of pre-trained networks, simultaneously. Conducting on a thorough set of experiments, we show that our method can serve as a general regularization method to existing DD methods and improve the performance and training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Xu, Jiangang Yang, Wenhui Shi, Siyuan Ding, Luqing Luo, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train on a single source domain for robust performance across a variety of unseen target domains by taking advantage of an object detector. Existing S-DGOD approaches often rely on data augmentation strategies, including a composition of visual transformations, to enhance the detector's generalization ability. However, the absence of real-world prior knowledge hinders data augmentation from contributing to the diversity of training data distributions. To address this issue, we propose PhysAug, a novel physical model-based non-ideal imaging condition data augmentation method, to enhance the adaptability of the S-DGOD tasks. Drawing upon the principles of atmospheric optics, we develop a universal perturbation model that serves as the foundation for our proposed PhysAug. Given that visual perturbations typically arise from the interaction of light with atmospheric particles, the image frequency spectrum is harnessed to simulate real-world variations during training. This approach fosters the detector to learn domain-invariant representations, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize across various settings. Without altering the network architecture or loss function, our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art across various S-DGOD datasets. In particular, it achieves a substantial improvement of $7.3\%$ and $7.2\%$ over the baseline on DWD and Cityscape-C, highlighting its enhanced generalizability in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Wei Li, Didi Zhu, Hangjie Yuan, Wendi Zheng, Dan Zhang, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation provides a generalized configuration for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Like, SGD and Adam are commonly used for weight updates in continual learning and continual pre-training. In practice, permission to access gradient information is not always granted (the gradient ban), such as black-box APIs, hardware limitations, and non-differentiable systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark ZeroFlow to evaluate gradient-free optimization algorithms for overcoming forgetting. This benchmark examines a suite of forward pass methods across multiple methods, forgetting scenarios, and datasets. We find that forward passes alone are enough to overcome forgetting. Our findings reveal new optimization principles that highlight the potential of forward-pass in mitigating forgetting, managing task conflicts, and reducing memory demands, alongside novel enhancements that further mitigate forgetting with just one forward pass. This work provides essential insights and tools for advancing forward pass methods to overcome forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunming He, Rihan Zhang, Fengyang Xiao, Chengyu Fang, Longxiang Tang, Yulun Zhang, Linghe Kong, Deng-Ping Fan, Kai Li, Sina Farsiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing concealed object segmentation (COS) methods frequently utilize reversible strategies to address uncertain regions. However, these approaches are typically restricted to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To address this, we propose the Reversible Unfolding Network (RUN), which applies reversible strategies across both mask and RGB domains through a theoretically grounded framework, enabling accurate segmentation. RUN first formulates a novel COS model by incorporating an extra residual sparsity constraint to minimize segmentation uncertainties. The iterative optimization steps of the proposed model are then unfolded into a multistage network, with each step corresponding to a stage. Each stage of RUN consists of two reversible modules: the Segmentation-Oriented Foreground Separation (SOFS) module and the Reconstruction-Oriented Background Extraction (ROBE) module. SOFS applies the reversible strategy at the mask level and introduces Reversible State Space to capture non-local information. ROBE extends this to the RGB domain, employing a reconstruction network to address conflicting foreground and background regions identified as distortion-prone areas, which arise from their separate estimation by independent modules. As the stages progress, RUN gradually facilitates reversible modeling of foreground and background in both the mask and RGB domains, directing the network's attention to uncertain regions and mitigating false-positive and false-negative results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of RUN and highlight the potential of unfolding-based frameworks for COS and other high-level vision tasks. We will release the code and models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with visual perception capabilities, enabling them to process and interpret visual information. A major challenge compromising their reliability is object hallucination that LVMs may generate plausible but factually inaccurate information. We propose a novel visual adversarial perturbation (VAP) method to mitigate this hallucination issue. VAP alleviates LVM hallucination by applying strategically optimized visual noise without altering the base model. Our approach formulates hallucination suppression as an optimization problem, leveraging adversarial strategies to generate beneficial visual perturbations that enhance the model's factual grounding and reduce parametric knowledge bias. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently reduces object hallucinations across 8 state-of-the-art LVMs, validating its efficacy across diverse evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efforts to connect LiDAR data with text, such as LidarCLIP, have primarily focused on embedding 3D point clouds into CLIP text-image space. However, these approaches rely on 3D point clouds, which present challenges in encoding efficiency and neural network processing. With the advent of advanced LiDAR sensors like Ouster OS1, which, in addition to 3D point clouds, produce fixed resolution depth, signal, and ambient panoramic 2D images, new opportunities emerge for LiDAR based tasks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to connect LiDAR data with text by leveraging 2D imagery generated by the OS1 sensor instead of 3D point clouds. Using the Florence 2 large model in a zero-shot setting, we perform image captioning and object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Florence 2 generates more informative captions and achieves superior performance in object detection tasks compared to existing methods like CLIP. By combining advanced LiDAR sensor data with a large pre-trained model, our approach provides a robust and accurate solution for challenging detection scenarios, including real-time applications requiring high accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous 3D human creation methods have made significant progress in synthesizing view-consistent and temporally aligned results from sparse-view images or monocular videos. However, it remains challenging to produce perpetually realistic, view-consistent, and temporally coherent human avatars from a single image, as limited information is available in the single-view input setting. Motivated by the success of 2D character animation, we propose HumanGif, a single-view human diffusion model with generative prior. Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models to complement the missing information. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople and DNA-Rendering datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of MLLM-based GUI agents, compared to smartphones, the PC scenario not only features a more complex interactive environment, but also involves more intricate intra- and inter-app workflows. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: The Diffusion Transformer plays a pivotal role in advancing text-to-image and text-to-video generation, owing primarily to its inherent scalability. However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Li, Keyuan Zhou, Tong Liu, Yu Wang, Mingqiao Zhuang, Huan-ang Gao, Bu Jin, Hao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic accidents present complex challenges for autonomous driving, often featuring unpredictable scenarios that hinder accurate system interpretation and responses. Nonetheless, prevailing methodologies fall short in elucidating the causes of accidents and proposing preventive measures due to the paucity of training data specific to accident scenarios. In this work, we introduce AVD2 (Accident Video Diffusion for Accident Video Description), a novel framework that enhances accident scene understanding by generating accident videos that aligned with detailed natural language descriptions and reasoning, resulting in the contributed EMM-AU (Enhanced Multi-Modal Accident Video Understanding) dataset. Empirical results reveal that the integration of the EMM-AU dataset establishes state-of-the-art performance across both automated metrics and human evaluations, markedly advancing the domains of accident analysis and prevention.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Gao, Qi Jiang, Shaohua Gao, Lei Sun, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, joint design approaches that simultaneously optimize optical systems and downstream algorithms through data-driven learning have demonstrated superior performance over traditional separate design approaches. However, current joint design approaches heavily rely on the manual identification of initial lenses, posing challenges and limitations, particularly for compound lens systems with multiple potential starting points. In this work, we present Quasi-Global Search Optics (QGSO) to automatically design compound lens based computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution in all search results. Extensive experimental results illustrate that QGSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global search ability, which automatically provides compound lens based computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to existing paradigms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago Novello, Diana Aldana, Andre Araujo, Luiz Velho</p>
<p>Abstract: Sinusoidal neural networks have been shown effective as implicit neural representations (INRs) of low-dimensional signals, due to their smoothness and high representation capacity. However, initializing and training them remain empirical tasks which lack on deeper understanding to guide the learning process. To fill this gap, our work introduces a theoretical framework that explains the capacity property of sinusoidal networks and offers robust control mechanisms for initialization and training. Our analysis is based on a novel amplitude-phase expansion of the sinusoidal multilayer perceptron, showing how its layer compositions produce a large number of new frequencies expressed as integer combinations of the input frequencies. This relationship can be directly used to initialize the input neurons, as a form of spectral sampling, and to bound the network's spectrum while training. Our method, referred to as TUNER (TUNing sinusoidal nEtwoRks), greatly improves the stability and convergence of sinusoidal INR training, leading to detailed reconstructions, while preventing overfitting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Jiang, Jian Li, Hanqiu Deng, Yong Liu, Bin-Bin Gao, Yifeng Zhou, Jialin Li, Chengjie Wang, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of industrial inspection, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have a high potential to renew the paradigms in practical applications due to their robust language capabilities and generalization abilities. However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Fu, Ruobing Xie, Jiazhen Liu, Bangxiang Lan, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hinder their practical applications. To address this, we propose a Magnifier Prompt (MagPrompt), a simple yet effective method to tackle hallucinations in MLLMs via extremely simple instructions. MagPrompt is based on the following two key principles, which guide the design of various effective prompts, demonstrating robustness: (1) MLLMs should focus more on the image. (2) When there are conflicts between the image and the model's inner knowledge, MLLMs should prioritize the image. MagPrompt is training-free and can be applied to open-source and closed-source models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini-pro. It performs well across many datasets and its effectiveness is comparable or even better than more complex methods like VCD. Furthermore, our prompt design principles and experimental analyses provide valuable insights into multimodal hallucination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Wu, Qingpeng Kong, Zihang Jiang, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), serves as a ``microscope'' for anatomical structures and routinely mitigates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio scans by compromising temporal or spatial resolution. However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18936">Adaptive Prompt: Unlocking the Power of Visual Prompt Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Le, Anh Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Chau Nguyen, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has recently emerged as a powerful method for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks. By introducing learnable prompt tokens as task-specific instructions, VPT effectively guides pre-trained transformer models with minimal overhead. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VPT remains an active area of research. Building on recent insights into the connection between mixture of experts and prompt-based approaches, we identify a key limitation in VPT: the restricted functional expressiveness in prompt formulation. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT), a new generation of prompts that redefines prompts as adaptive functions of the input. Our theoretical analysis shows that this simple yet intuitive approach achieves optimal sample efficiency. Empirical results on VTAB-1K and FGVC further demonstrate VAPT's effectiveness, with performance gains of 7.34% and 1.04% over fully fine-tuning baselines, respectively. Notably, VAPT also surpasses VPT by a substantial margin while using fewer parameters. These results highlight both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and pave the way for future research to explore the potential of adaptive prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Kim, Minwoo Jung, Chiyun Noh, Sangwoo Jung, Hyunho Song, Wooseong Yang, Hyesu Jang, Ayoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, radars have been widely featured in robotics for their robustness in challenging weather conditions. Two commonly used radar types are spinning radars and phased-array radars, each offering distinct sensor characteristics. Existing datasets typically feature only a single type of radar, leading to the development of algorithms limited to that specific kind. In this work, we highlight that combining different radar types offers complementary advantages, which can be leveraged through a heterogeneous radar dataset. Moreover, this new dataset fosters research in multi-session and multi-robot scenarios where robots are equipped with different types of radars. In this context, we introduce the HeRCULES dataset, a comprehensive, multi-modal dataset with heterogeneous radars, FMCW LiDAR, IMU, GPS, and cameras. This is the first dataset to integrate 4D radar and spinning radar alongside FMCW LiDAR, offering unparalleled localization, mapping, and place recognition capabilities. The dataset covers diverse weather and lighting conditions and a range of urban traffic scenarios, enabling a comprehensive analysis across various environments. The sequence paths with multiple revisits and ground truth pose for each sensor enhance its suitability for place recognition research. We expect the HeRCULES dataset to facilitate odometry, mapping, place recognition, and sensor fusion research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luohong Wu, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Matthias Seibold, Giuseppe Loggia, Lisa Reissner, Jonas Hein, Silvan Beeler, Arnd Vieh\"ofer, Stephan Wirth, Lilian Calvet, Philipp F\"urnstahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed.
  We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score.
  We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p < 0.001). The model trained on UltraBones100k consistently outperforms manual labeling in all metrics, particularly in low-intensity regions (320% improvement in completeness at a distance threshold of 0.5 mm).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Tang, Anxing Xiao, Yuhong Deng, Tianrun Hu, Wenlong Dong, Hanbo Zhang, David Hsu, Hong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning tool use from a single human demonstration video offers a highly intuitive and efficient approach to robot teaching. While humans can effortlessly generalize a demonstrated tool manipulation skill to diverse tools that support the same function (e.g., pouring with a mug versus a teapot), current one-shot imitation learning (OSIL) methods struggle to achieve this. A key challenge lies in establishing functional correspondences between demonstration and test tools, considering significant geometric variations among tools with the same function (i.e., intra-function variations). To address this challenge, we propose FUNCTO (Function-Centric OSIL for Tool Manipulation), an OSIL method that establishes function-centric correspondences with a 3D functional keypoint representation, enabling robots to generalize tool manipulation skills from a single human demonstration video to novel tools with the same function despite significant intra-function variations. With this formulation, we factorize FUNCTO into three stages: (1) functional keypoint extraction, (2) function-centric correspondence establishment, and (3) functional keypoint-based action planning. We evaluate FUNCTO against exiting modular OSIL methods and end-to-end behavioral cloning methods through real-robot experiments on diverse tool manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of FUNCTO when generalizing to novel tools with intra-function geometric variations. More details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/functo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyi Zhou, Yichen Zhu, Minjie Zhu, Junjie Wen, Ning Liu, Zhiyuan Xu, Weibin Meng, Ran Cheng, Yaxin Peng, Chaomin Shen, Feifei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans possess a unified cognitive ability to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by mimicking biological neural principles, establishing them as a promising approach to mitigate the increasing energy demands of large-scale neural models. However, fully harnessing the capabilities of SNNs remains challenging due to their discrete signal processing and temporal dynamics. ANN-SNN conversion has emerged as a practical approach, enabling SNNs to achieve competitive performance on complex machine learning tasks. In this work, we identify a phenomenon in the ANN-SNN conversion framework, termed temporal misalignment, in which random spike rearrangement across SNN layers leads to performance improvements. Based on this observation, we introduce biologically plausible two-phase probabilistic (TPP) spiking neurons, further enhancing the conversion process. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method both theoretically and empirically through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet across a variety of architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), particularly Vision Transformers (ViT) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked significant advances in the field of medical image analysis. These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current humanoid robot control frameworks, which primarily rely on reactive mechanisms and lack autonomous interaction capabilities due to data scarcity. We propose Humanoid-VLA, a novel framework that integrates language understanding, egocentric scene perception, and motion control, enabling universal humanoid control. Humanoid-VLA begins with language-motion pre-alignment using non-egocentric human motion datasets paired with textual descriptions, allowing the model to learn universal motion patterns and action semantics. We then incorporate egocentric visual context through a parameter efficient video-conditioned fine-tuning, enabling context-aware motion generation. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised data augmentation strategy that automatically generates pseudoannotations directly derived from motion data. This process converts raw motion sequences into informative question-answer pairs, facilitating the effective use of large-scale unlabeled video data. Built upon whole-body control architectures, extensive experiments show that Humanoid-VLA achieves object interaction and environment exploration tasks with enhanced contextual awareness, demonstrating a more human-like capacity for adaptive and intelligent engagement.</p>
