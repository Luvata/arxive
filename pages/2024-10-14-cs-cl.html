<p><b>Authors:</b> William Thorne, Ambrose Robinson, Bohua Peng, Chenghua Lin, Diana Maynard</p>
<p>Abstract: As the cultural heritage sector increasingly adopts technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide more personalised search experiences and enable conversations with collections data, the demand for specialised evaluation datasets has grown. While end-to-end system testing is essential, it's equally important to assess individual components. We target the final, answering task, which is well-suited to Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). Although existing MRC datasets address general domains, they lack the specificity needed for cultural heritage information. Unfortunately, the manual creation of such datasets is prohibitively expensive for most heritage institutions. This paper presents a cost-effective approach for generating domain-specific MRC datasets with increased difficulty using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from synthetic preference data. Our method leverages the performance of existing question-answering models on a subset of SQuAD to create a difficulty metric, assuming that more challenging questions are answered correctly less frequently. This research contributes: (1) A methodology for increasing question difficulty using PPO and synthetic data; (2) Empirical evidence of the method's effectiveness, including human evaluation; (3) An in-depth error analysis and study of emergent phenomena; and (4) An open-source codebase and set of three llama-2-chat adapters for reproducibility and adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Li, Jiaxin Zhang, Chao Yan, Kamalika Das, Sricharan Kumar, Murat Kantarcioglu, Bradley A. Malin</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) are known to suffer from hallucinations and misinformation. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) that retrieves verifiable information from an external knowledge corpus to complement the parametric knowledge in LMs provides a tangible solution to these problems. However, the generation quality of RAG is highly dependent on the relevance between a user's query and the retrieved documents. Inaccurate responses may be generated when the query is outside of the scope of knowledge represented in the external knowledge corpus or if the information in the corpus is out-of-date. In this work, we establish a statistical framework that assesses how well a query can be answered by an RAG system by capturing the relevance of knowledge. We introduce an online testing procedure that employs goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests to inspect the relevance of each user query to detect out-of-knowledge queries with low knowledge relevance. Additionally, we develop an offline testing framework that examines a collection of user queries, aiming to detect significant shifts in the query distribution which indicates the knowledge corpus is no longer sufficiently capable of supporting the interests of the users. We demonstrate the capabilities of these strategies through a systematic evaluation on eight question-answering (QA) datasets, the results of which indicate that the new testing framework is an efficient solution to enhance the reliability of existing RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benno Weck, Frederic Font</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines textual, user-written search queries within the context of sound search engines, encompassing various applications such as foley, sound effects, and general audio retrieval. Current research inadequately addresses real-world user needs and behaviours in designing text-based audio retrieval systems. To bridge this gap, we analysed search queries from two sources: a custom survey and Freesound website query logs. The survey was designed to collect queries for an unrestricted, hypothetical sound search engine, resulting in a dataset that captures user intentions without the constraints of existing systems. This dataset is also made available for sharing with the research community. In contrast, the Freesound query logs encompass approximately 9 million search requests, providing a comprehensive view of real-world usage patterns. Our findings indicate that survey queries are generally longer than Freesound queries, suggesting users prefer detailed queries when not limited by system constraints. Both datasets predominantly feature keyword-based queries, with few survey participants using full sentences. Key factors influencing survey queries include the primary sound source, intended usage, perceived location, and the number of sound sources. These insights are crucial for developing user-centred, effective text-based audio retrieval systems, enhancing our understanding of user behaviour in sound search contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krithika Ramesh, Nupoor Gandhi, Pulkit Madaan, Lisa Bauer, Charith Peris, Anjalie Field</p>
<p>Abstract: The difficulty of anonymizing text data hinders the development and deployment of NLP in high-stakes domains that involve private data, such as healthcare and social services. Poorly anonymized sensitive data cannot be easily shared with annotators or external researchers, nor can it be used to train public models. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using synthetic data generated from differentially private language models in place of real data to facilitate the development of NLP in these domains without compromising privacy. In contrast to prior work, we generate synthetic data for real high-stakes domains, and we propose and conduct use-inspired evaluations to assess data quality. Our results show that prior simplistic evaluations have failed to highlight utility, privacy, and fairness issues in the synthetic data. Overall, our work underscores the need for further improvements to synthetic data generation for it to be a viable way to enable privacy-preserving data sharing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tirthankar Mittra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates how children learn numbers using the framework of reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on the impact of language instructions. The motivation for using reinforcement learning stems from its parallels with psychological learning theories in controlled environments. By using state of the art deep reinforcement learning models, we simulate and analyze the effects of various forms of language instructions on number acquisition. Our findings indicate that certain linguistic structures more effectively improve numerical comprehension in RL agents. Additionally, our model predicts optimal sequences for presenting numbers to RL agents which enhance their speed of learning. This research provides valuable insights into the interplay between language and numerical cognition, with implications for both educational strategies and the development of artificial intelligence systems designed to support early childhood learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael C. Stern, Jason A. Shaw</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqiang Wang, Jiageng Wu, Yuqi Wang, Wei Wang, Jie Yang, Jon Johnson, Nishanth Sastry, Suparna De</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media is recognized as an important source for deriving insights into public opinion dynamics and social impacts due to the vast textual data generated daily and the 'unconstrained' behavior of people interacting on these platforms. However, such analyses prove challenging due to the semantic shift phenomenon, where word meanings evolve over time. This paper proposes an unsupervised dynamic word embedding method to capture longitudinal semantic shifts in social media data without predefined anchor words. The method leverages word co-occurrence statistics and dynamic updating to adapt embeddings over time, addressing the challenges of data sparseness, imbalanced distributions, and synergistic semantic effects. Evaluated on a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset, the method reveals semantic evolution patterns of vaccine- and symptom-related entities across different pandemic stages, and their potential correlations with real-world statistics. Our key contributions include the dynamic embedding technique, empirical analysis of COVID-19 semantic shifts, and discussions on enhancing semantic shift modeling for computational social science research. This study enables capturing longitudinal semantic dynamics on social media to understand public discourse and collective phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Gauthier-Caron, Shamane Siriwardhana, Elliot Stein, Malikeh Ehghaghi, Charles Goddard, Mark McQuade, Jacob Solawetz, Maxime Labonne</p>
<p>Abstract: By merging models, AI systems can combine the distinct strengths of separate language models, achieving a balance between multiple capabilities without requiring substantial retraining. However, the integration process can be intricate due to differences in training methods and fine-tuning, typically necessitating specialized knowledge and repeated refinement. This paper explores model merging techniques across a spectrum of complexity, examining where automated methods like evolutionary strategies stand compared to hyperparameter-driven approaches such as DARE, TIES-Merging and simpler methods like Model Soups. In addition, we introduce Differentiable Adaptive Merging (DAM), an efficient, adaptive merging approach as an alternative to evolutionary merging that optimizes model integration through scaling coefficients, minimizing computational demands. Our findings reveal that even simple averaging methods, like Model Soups, perform competitively when model similarity is high, underscoring each technique's unique strengths and limitations. We open-sourced DAM, including the implementation code and experiment pipeline, on GitHub: https://github.com/arcee-ai/DAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Pokrywka, Jeremi I. Kaczmarek, Edward J. Gorzela\'nczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of suicide risk in social media is a critical task with potential life-saving implications. This paper presents a study on leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing solutions for identifying suicide risk in social media posts as a submission for the "IEEE BigData 2024 Cup: Detection of Suicide Risk on Social Media" conducted by the kubapok team. We experimented with the following configurations of transformer-based models: fine-tuned DeBERTa, GPT-4o with CoT and few-shot prompting, and fine-tuned GPT-4o. The task setup was to classify social media posts into four categories: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt. Our findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned GPT-4o model outperforms two other configurations, achieving high accuracy in identifying suicide risk. Notably, our model achieved second place in the competition. By demonstrating that straightforward, general-purpose models can achieve state-of-the-art results, we propose that these models, combined with minimal tuning, may have the potential to be effective solutions for automated suicide risk detection on social media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximus Powers, Hua Wei, Umang Mavani, Harshitha Reddy Jonala, Ansh Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of bias in natural language processing (NLP) is a critical challenge, particularly with the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in various domains. This paper introduces GUS-Net, an innovative approach to bias detection that focuses on three key types of biases: (G)eneralizations, (U)nfairness, and (S)tereotypes. GUS-Net leverages generative AI and automated agents to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset, enabling robust multi-label token classification. Our methodology enhances traditional bias detection methods by incorporating the contextual encodings of pre-trained models, resulting in improved accuracy and depth in identifying biased entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GUS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and Hamming Loss. The findings highlight GUS-Net's effectiveness in capturing a wide range of biases across diverse contexts, making it a valuable tool for social bias detection in text. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts in NLP to address implicit bias, providing a pathway for future research and applications in various fields.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxwell Horton, Qingqing Cao, Chenfan Sun, Yanzi Jin, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Moin Nabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Rogulsky, Nicholas Popovic, Michael F\"arber</p>
<p>Abstract: Relation extraction is crucial for constructing knowledge graphs, with large high-quality datasets serving as the foundation for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating models. Generative data augmentation (GDA) is a common approach to expand such datasets. However, this approach often introduces hallucinations, such as spurious facts, whose impact on relation extraction remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effects of hallucinations on the performance of relation extraction on the document and sentence levels. Our empirical study reveals that hallucinations considerably compromise the ability of models to extract relations from text, with recall reductions between 19.1% and 39.2%. We identify that relevant hallucinations impair the model's performance, while irrelevant hallucinations have a minimal impact. Additionally, we develop methods for the detection of hallucinations to improve data quality and model performance. Our approaches successfully classify texts as either 'hallucinated' or 'clean,' achieving high F1-scores of 83.8% and 92.2%. These methods not only assist in removing hallucinations but also help in estimating their prevalence within datasets, which is crucial for selecting high-quality data. Overall, our work confirms the profound impact of relevant hallucinations on the effectiveness of relation extraction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sitao Cheng, Liangming Pan, Xunjian Yin, Xinyi Wang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge during pre-training (parametric knowledge, or PK) and can further be enhanced by incorporating contextual knowledge (CK). Can LLMs effectively integrate their internal PK with external CK to solve complex problems? In this paper, we investigate the dynamic interaction between PK and CK, categorizing their relationships into four types: Supportive, Complementary, Conflicting, and Irrelevant. To support this investigation, we introduce ECHOQA, a benchmark spanning scientific, factual, and commonsense knowledge. Our results show that LLMs tend to suppress their PK when contextual information is available, even when it is complementary or irrelevant. While tailored instructions can encourage LLMs to rely more on their PK, they still struggle to fully leverage it. These findings reveal a key vulnerability in LLMs, raising concerns about their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for medical applications but often lack specialized clinical knowledge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows customization with domain-specific information, making it suitable for healthcare. This study evaluates the accuracy, consistency, and safety of RAG models in determining fitness for surgery and providing preoperative instructions. We developed LLM-RAG models using 35 local and 23 international preoperative guidelines and tested them against human-generated responses. A total of 3,682 responses were evaluated. Clinical documents were processed using Llamaindex, and 10 LLMs, including GPT3.5, GPT4, and Claude-3, were assessed. Fourteen clinical scenarios were analyzed, focusing on seven aspects of preoperative instructions. Established guidelines and expert judgment were used to determine correct responses, with human-generated answers serving as comparisons. The LLM-RAG models generated responses within 20 seconds, significantly faster than clinicians (10 minutes). The GPT4 LLM-RAG model achieved the highest accuracy (96.4% vs. 86.6%, p=0.016), with no hallucinations and producing correct instructions comparable to clinicians. Results were consistent across both local and international guidelines. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-RAG models for preoperative healthcare tasks, highlighting their efficiency, scalability, and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a new dynamic vocabulary for language models. It can involve arbitrary text spans during generation. These text spans act as basic generation bricks, akin to tokens in the traditional static vocabularies. We show that, the ability to generate multi-tokens atomically improve both generation quality and efficiency (compared to the standard language model, the MAUVE metric is increased by 25%, the latency is decreased by 20%). The dynamic vocabulary can be deployed in a plug-and-play way, thus is attractive for various downstream applications. For example, we demonstrate that dynamic vocabulary can be applied to different domains in a training-free manner. It also helps to generate reliable citations in question answering tasks (substantially enhancing citation results without compromising answer accuracy).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08521">Improving Legal Entity Recognition Using a Hybrid Transformer Model and Semantic Filtering Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Duraimurugan Rajamanickam</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal Entity Recognition (LER) is critical in automating legal workflows such as contract analysis, compliance monitoring, and litigation support. Existing approaches, including rule-based systems and classical machine learning models, struggle with the complexity of legal documents and domain specificity, particularly in handling ambiguities and nested entity structures. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model that enhances the accuracy and precision of Legal-BERT, a transformer model fine-tuned for legal text processing, by introducing a semantic similarity-based filtering mechanism. We evaluate the model on a dataset of 15,000 annotated legal documents, achieving an F1 score of 93.4%, demonstrating significant improvements in precision and recall over previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyi Chen, Binxuan Huang, Yifan Gao, Zhengyang Wang, Jingfeng Yang, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance after the critical "emergent phase". In preliminary experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. This motivates FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training, specifically blending general corpora with code data to accurately represent the common necessity. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08545">Humanity in AI: Detecting the Personality of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Baohua Zhan, Yongyi Huang, Wenyao Cui, Huaping Zhang, Jianyun Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Questionnaires are a common method for detecting the personality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their reliability is often compromised by two main issues: hallucinations (where LLMs produce inaccurate or irrelevant responses) and the sensitivity of responses to the order of the presented options. To address these issues, we propose combining text mining with questionnaires method. Text mining can extract psychological features from the LLMs' responses without being affected by the order of options. Furthermore, because this method does not rely on specific answers, it reduces the influence of hallucinations. By normalizing the scores from both methods and calculating the root mean square error, our experiment results confirm the effectiveness of this approach. To further investigate the origins of personality traits in LLMs, we conduct experiments on both pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and GPT, as well as conversational models (ChatLLMs), such as ChatGPT. The results show that LLMs do contain certain personalities, for example, ChatGPT and ChatGLM exhibit the personality traits of 'Conscientiousness'. Additionally, we find that the personalities of LLMs are derived from their pre-trained data. The instruction data used to train ChatLLMs can enhance the generation of data containing personalities and expose their hidden personality. We compare the results with the human average personality score, and we find that the personality of FLAN-T5 in PLMs and ChatGPT in ChatLLMs is more similar to that of a human, with score differences of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively.</p>

This research addresses this issue by leveraging embedding and clustering techniques to analyze the similarity between COAs based on cited legal articles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, Asif Mahmud, Md. Shohanur Islam Sobuj, Prakash Bhat, Md Kowsher, Niloofar Yousefi, Ozlem Ozmen Garibay</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant popularity in recent years for specialized tasks using prompts due to their low computational cost. Standard methods like prefix tuning utilize special, modifiable tokens that lack semantic meaning and require extensive training for best performance, often falling short. In this context, we propose a novel method called Semantic Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) for prompt and prefix tuning that employs meaningful words instead of random tokens. This method involves using a fixed LLM to understand and process the semantic content of the prompt through zero-shot capabilities. Following this, it integrates the processed prompt with the input text to improve the model's performance on particular tasks. Our experimental results show that SK-Tuning exhibits faster training times, fewer parameters, and superior performance on tasks such as text classification and understanding compared to other tuning methods. This approach offers a promising method for optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in processing language tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is pivotal for harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications. While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of tasks, including reasoning, natural language understanding, domain-specific knowledge, and industrial applications, demonstrate StraGo's superior performance. It establishes a new state-of-the-art in prompt optimization, showcasing its ability to deliver stable and effective prompt improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Christmann, Svitlana Vakulenko, Ionut Teodor Sorodoc, Bill Byrne, Adri\`a de Gispert</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) aims at generating in-depth answers to end-user questions, providing relevant information beyond the direct answer. However, existing retrievers are typically optimized towards information that directly targets the question, missing out on such contextual information. Furthermore, there is a lack of training data for relevant context. To this end, we propose and compare different weak supervision techniques to optimize retrieval for contextual information. Experiments demonstrate improvements on the end-to-end QA performance on ASQA, a dataset for long-form question answering. Importantly, as more contextual information is retrieved, we improve the relevant page recall for LFQA by 14.7% and the groundedness of generated long-form answers by 12.5%. Finally, we show that long-form answers often anticipate likely follow-up questions, via experiments on a conversational QA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhun Lee, Jun-gyu Jin, Younghyun Cho, Eunhyeok Park</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth in the use of fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs), optimizing fine-tuning while keeping inference efficient has become highly important. However, this is a challenging task as it requires improvements in all aspects, including inference speed, fine-tuning speed, memory consumption, and, most importantly, model quality. Previous studies have attempted to achieve this by combining quantization with fine-tuning, but they have failed to enhance all four aspects simultaneously. In this study, we propose a new lightweight technique called Quantization for Efficient Fine-Tuning (QEFT). QEFT accelerates both inference and fine-tuning, is supported by robust theoretical foundations, offers high flexibility, and maintains good hardware compatibility. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that QEFT matches the quality and versatility of full-precision parameter-efficient fine-tuning, while using fewer resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nizar Habash, Hanada Taha-Thomure, Khalid N. Elmadani, Zeina Zeino, Abdallah Abushmaes</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the foundational framework and initial findings of the Balanced Arabic Readability Evaluation Corpus (BAREC) project, designed to address the need for comprehensive Arabic language resources aligned with diverse readability levels. Inspired by the Taha/Arabi21 readability reference, BAREC aims to provide a standardized reference for assessing sentence-level Arabic text readability across 19 distinct levels, ranging in targets from kindergarten to postgraduate comprehension. Our ultimate goal with BAREC is to create a comprehensive and balanced corpus that represents a wide range of genres, topics, and regional variations through a multifaceted approach combining manual annotation with AI-driven tools. This paper focuses on our meticulous annotation guidelines, demonstrated through the analysis of 10,631 sentences/phrases (113,651 words). The average pairwise inter-annotator agreement, measured by Quadratic Weighted Kappa, is 79.9%, reflecting a high level of substantial agreement. We also report competitive results for benchmarking automatic readability assessment. We will make the BAREC corpus and guidelines openly accessible to support Arabic language research and education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is very important to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our adoption of a minimal search strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anvesh Rao Vijjini, Rakesh R. Menon, Jiayi Fu, Shashank Srivastava, Snigdha Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Abstract: While much research has explored enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the last few years, there is a gap in understanding the alignment of these models with social values and norms. We introduce the task of judging social acceptance. Social acceptance requires models to judge and rationalize the acceptability of people's actions in social situations. For example, is it socially acceptable for a neighbor to ask others in the community to keep their pets indoors at night? We find that LLMs' understanding of social acceptance is often misaligned with human consensus. To alleviate this, we introduce SocialGaze, a multi-step prompting framework, in which a language model verbalizes a social situation from multiple perspectives before forming a judgment. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialGaze approach improves the alignment with human judgments by up to 11 F1 points with the GPT-3.5 model. We also identify biases and correlations in LLMs in assigning blame that is related to features such as the gender (males are significantly more likely to be judged unfairly) and age (LLMs are more aligned with humans for older narrators).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Hong, Che Jiang, Biqing Qi, Fandong Meng, Mo Yu, Bowen Zhou, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Length extrapolation algorithms based on Rotary position embedding (RoPE) have shown promising results in extending the context length of language models. However, understanding how position embedding can capture longer-range contextual information remains elusive. Based on the intuition that different dimensions correspond to different frequency of changes in RoPE encoding, we conducted a dimension-level analysis to investigate the correlation between a hidden dimension of an attention head and its contribution to capturing long-distance dependencies. Using our correlation metric, we identified a particular type of attention heads, which we named Positional Heads, from various length-extrapolated models. These heads exhibit a strong focus on long-range information interaction and play a pivotal role in long input processing, as evidence by our ablation. We further demonstrate the correlation between the efficiency of length extrapolation and the extension of the high-dimensional attention allocation of these heads. The identification of Positional Heads provides insights for future research in long-text comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thapelo Sindane, Vukosi Marivate</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of N-gram models and Large Pre-trained Multilingual models for Language Identification (LID) across 11 South African languages. For N-gram models, this study shows that effective data size selection remains crucial for establishing effective frequency distributions of the target languages, that efficiently model each language, thus, improving language ranking. For pre-trained multilingual models, we conduct extensive experiments covering a diverse set of massively pre-trained multilingual (PLM) models -- mBERT, RemBERT, XLM-r, and Afri-centric multilingual models -- AfriBERTa, Afro-XLMr, AfroLM, and Serengeti. We further compare these models with available large-scale Language Identification tools: Compact Language Detector v3 (CLD V3), AfroLID, GlotLID, and OpenLID to highlight the importance of focused-based LID. From these, we show that Serengeti is a superior model across models: N-grams to Transformers on average. Moreover, we propose a lightweight BERT-based LID model (za_BERT_lid) trained with NHCLT + Vukzenzele corpus, which performs on par with our best-performing Afri-centric models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeeun Kim, Young Rok Choi, Eunkyung Choi, Jinhwan Choi, Hai Jin Park, Wonseok Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the legal domain, with GPT-4 even passing the Uniform Bar Exam in the U.S. However their efficacy remains limited for non-standardized tasks and tasks in languages other than English. This underscores the need for careful evaluation of LLMs within each legal system before application. Here, we introduce KBL, a benchmark for assessing the Korean legal language understanding of LLMs, consisting of (1) 7 legal knowledge tasks (510 examples), (2) 4 legal reasoning tasks (288 examples), and (3) the Korean bar exam (4 domains, 53 tasks, 2,510 examples). First two datasets were developed in close collaboration with lawyers to evaluate LLMs in practical scenarios in a certified manner. Furthermore, considering legal practitioners' frequent use of extensive legal documents for research, we assess LLMs in both a closed book setting, where they rely solely on internal knowledge, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setting, using a corpus of Korean statutes and precedents. The results indicate substantial room and opportunities for improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: In high-stakes domains like legal question-answering, the accuracy and trustworthiness of generative AI systems are of paramount importance. This work presents a comprehensive benchmark of various methods to assess the groundedness of AI-generated responses, aiming to significantly enhance their reliability. Our experiments include similarity-based metrics and natural language inference models to evaluate whether responses are well-founded in the given contexts. We also explore different prompting strategies for large language models to improve the detection of ungrounded responses. We validated the effectiveness of these methods using a newly created grounding classification corpus, designed specifically for legal queries and corresponding responses from retrieval-augmented prompting, focusing on their alignment with source material. Our results indicate potential in groundedness classification of generated responses, with the best method achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.8. Additionally, we evaluated the methods in terms of their latency to determine their suitability for real-world applications, as this step typically follows the generation process. This capability is essential for processes that may trigger additional manual verification or automated response regeneration. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of various detection methods to improve the trustworthiness of generative AI in legal settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08766">Integrating Supertag Features into Neural Discontinuous Constituent Parsing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Mielczarek</p>
<p>Abstract: Syntactic parsing is essential in natural-language processing, with constituent structure being one widely used description of syntax. Traditional views of constituency demand that constituents consist of adjacent words, but this poses challenges in analysing syntax with non-local dependencies, common in languages like German. Therefore, in a number of treebanks like NeGra and TIGER for German and DPTB for English, long-range dependencies are represented by crossing edges. Various grammar formalisms have been used to describe discontinuous trees - often with high time complexities for parsing. Transition-based parsing aims at reducing this factor by eliminating the need for an explicit grammar. Instead, neural networks are trained to produce trees given raw text input using supervised learning on large annotated corpora. An elegant proposal for a stack-free transition-based parser developed by Coavoux and Cohen (2019) successfully allows for the derivation of any discontinuous constituent tree over a sentence in worst-case quadratic time.
  The purpose of this work is to explore the introduction of supertag information into transition-based discontinuous constituent parsing. In lexicalised grammar formalisms like CCG (Steedman, 1989) informative categories are assigned to the words in a sentence and act as the building blocks for composing the sentence's syntax. These supertags indicate a word's structural role and syntactic relationship with surrounding items. The study examines incorporating supertag information by using a dedicated supertagger as additional input for a neural parser (pipeline) and by jointly training a neural model for both parsing and supertagging (multi-task). In addition to CCG, several other frameworks (LTAG-spinal, LCFRS) and sequence labelling tasks (chunking, dependency parsing) will be compared in terms of their suitability as auxiliary tasks for parsing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational approaches to predicting mental health conditions in social media have been substantially explored in the past years. Multiple surveys have been published on this topic, providing the community with comprehensive accounts of the research in this area. Among all mental health conditions, depression is the most widely studied due to its worldwide prevalence. The COVID-19 global pandemic, starting in early 2020, has had a great impact on mental health worldwide. Harsh measures employed by governments to slow the spread of the virus (e.g., lockdowns) and the subsequent economic downturn experienced in many countries have significantly impacted people's lives and mental health. Studies have shown a substantial increase of above 50% in the rate of depression in the population. In this context, we present a survey on natural language processing (NLP) approaches to modeling depression in social media, providing the reader with a post-COVID-19 outlook. This survey contributes to the understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on modeling depression in social media. We outline how state-of-the-art approaches and new datasets have been used in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we also discuss ethical issues in collecting and processing mental health data, considering fairness, accountability, and ethics.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the data preparation pipeline developed for the OpenGPT-X project, a large-scale initiative aimed at creating open and high-performance multilingual large language models (LLMs). The project goal is to deliver models that cover all major European languages, with a particular focus on real-world applications within the European Union. We explain all data processing steps, starting with the data selection and requirement definition to the preparation of the final datasets for model training. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these categories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing minimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication. This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and alignment with European data regulations. Finally, we share key insights and challenges faced during the project, offering recommendations for future endeavors in large-scale multilingual data preparation for LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruobing Wang, Daren Zha, Shi Yu, Qingfei Zhao, Yuxuan Chen, Yixuan Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates issues of the factual errors and hallucinated outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-domain question-answering tasks (OpenQA) via introducing external knowledge. For complex QA, however, existing RAG methods use LLMs to actively predict retrieval timing and directly use the retrieved information for generation, regardless of whether the retrieval timing accurately reflects the actual information needs, or sufficiently considers prior retrieved knowledge, which may result in insufficient information gathering and interaction, yielding low-quality answers. To address these, we propose a generic RAG approach called Adaptive Note-Enhanced RAG (Adaptive-Note) for complex QA tasks, which includes the iterative information collector, adaptive memory reviewer, and task-oriented generator, while following a new Retriever-and-Memory paradigm. Specifically, Adaptive-Note introduces an overarching view of knowledge growth, iteratively gathering new information in the form of notes and updating them into the existing optimal knowledge structure, enhancing high-quality knowledge interactions. In addition, we employ an adaptive, note-based stop-exploration strategy to decide "what to retrieve and when to stop" to encourage sufficient knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments on five complex QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aulia Adila, Dessi Lestari, Ayu Purwarianti, Dipta Tanaya, Kurniawati Azizah, Sakriani Sakti</p>
<p>Abstract: An ideal speech recognition model has the capability to transcribe speech accurately under various characteristics of speech signals, such as speaking style (read and spontaneous), speech context (formal and informal), and background noise conditions (clean and moderate). Building such a model requires a significant amount of training data with diverse speech characteristics. Currently, Indonesian data is dominated by read, formal, and clean speech, leading to a scarcity of Indonesian data with other speech variabilities. To develop Indonesian automatic speech recognition (ASR), we present our research on state-of-the-art speech recognition models, namely Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) and Whisper, as well as compiling a dataset comprising Indonesian speech with variabilities to facilitate our study. We further investigate the models' predictive ability to transcribe Indonesian speech data across different variability groups. The best results were achieved by the Whisper fine-tuned model across datasets with various characteristics, as indicated by the decrease in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER). Moreover, we found that speaking style variability affected model performance the most.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiutian Zhao, Ke Wang, Wei Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite large language models' (LLMs) recent advancements, their bias and hallucination issues persist, and their ability to offer consistent preferential rankings remains underexplored. This study investigates the capacity of LLMs to provide consistent ordinal preferences, a crucial aspect in scenarios with dense decision space or lacking absolute answers. We introduce a formalization of consistency based on order theory, outlining criteria such as transitivity, asymmetry, reversibility, and independence from irrelevant alternatives. Our diagnostic experiments on selected state-of-the-art LLMs reveal their inability to meet these criteria, indicating a strong positional bias and poor transitivity, with preferences easily swayed by irrelevant alternatives. These findings highlight a significant inconsistency in LLM-generated preferential rankings, underscoring the need for further research to address these limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingqiang Gao, Lukas Fischer, Alexa Lintner, Sarah Ebling</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) function as acoustic commentaries designed to assist blind persons and persons with visual impairments in accessing digital media content on television and in movies, among other settings. As an accessibility service typically provided by trained AD professionals, the generation of ADs demands significant human effort, making the process both time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have allowed for getting a step closer to automatic AD generation. This paper reviews the technologies pertinent to AD generation in the era of LLMs and VLMs: we discuss how state-of-the-art NLP and CV technologies can be applied to generate ADs and identify essential research directions for the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Qi, Zhiyang Xu, Rulin Shao, Yang Chen, Jing Di, Yu Cheng, Qifan Wang, Lifu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) still exhibit inferior performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, primarily due to the challenge of accurately encoding all the associations between visual objects and scenes to their corresponding entities and background knowledge. While retrieval augmentation methods offer an efficient way to integrate external knowledge, extending them to vision-language domain presents unique challenges in (1) precisely retrieving relevant information from external sources due to the inherent discrepancy within the multimodal queries, and (2) being resilient to the irrelevant, extraneous and noisy information contained in the retrieved multimodal knowledge snippets. In this work, we introduce RORA-VLM, a novel and robust retrieval augmentation framework specifically tailored for VLMs, with two key innovations: (1) a 2-stage retrieval process with image-anchored textual-query expansion to synergistically combine the visual and textual information in the query and retrieve the most relevant multimodal knowledge snippets; and (2) a robust retrieval augmentation method that strengthens the resilience of VLMs against irrelevant information in the retrieved multimodal knowledge by injecting adversarial noises into the retrieval-augmented training process, and filters out extraneous visual information, such as unrelated entities presented in images, via a query-oriented visual token refinement strategy. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods on three widely adopted benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that with a minimal amount of training instance, RORA-VLM enables the base model to achieve significant performance improvement and constantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented VLMs on all benchmarks while also exhibiting a novel zero-shot domain transfer capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Argumentative stance classification plays a key role in identifying authors' viewpoints on specific topics. However, generating diverse pairs of argumentative sentences across various domains is challenging. Existing benchmarks often come from a single domain or focus on a limited set of topics. Additionally, manual annotation for accurate labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging platform rules, readily available expert-curated content, and large language models to bypass the need for human annotation. Our approach produces a multidomain benchmark comprising 4,498 topical claims and 30,961 arguments from three sources, spanning 21 domains. We benchmark the dataset in fully supervised, zero-shot, and few-shot settings, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of different methodologies. We release the dataset and code in this study at hidden for anonymity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual Event Detection (CED) poses a formidable challenge due to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, where learning new tasks (with new coming event types) hampers performance on previous ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Lifelong Event Detection via Optimal Transport (LEDOT), that leverages optimal transport principles to align the optimization of our classification module with the intrinsic nature of each class, as defined by their pre-trained language modeling. Our method integrates replay sets, prototype latent representations, and an innovative Optimal Transport component. Extensive experiments on MAVEN and ACE datasets demonstrate LEDOT's superior performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The results underscore LEDOT as a pioneering solution in continual event detection, offering a more effective and nuanced approach to addressing catastrophic forgetting in evolving environments.</p>

However, evaluating LLM performance in a consistent and meaningful way across multiple European languages remains challenging, especially due to the scarcity of multilingual benchmarks. We introduce a cross-lingual evaluation approach tailored for European languages. We employ translated versions of five widely-used benchmarks to assess the capabilities of 40 LLMs across 21 European languages. Our contributions include examining the effectiveness of translated benchmarks, assessing the impact of different translation services, and offering a multilingual evaluation framework for LLMs that includes newly created datasets: EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC, EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Yang, Junhong Wu, Chen Wang, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08968">Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Zhang, Ahmed Elgohary, Ahmed Magooda, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.
  We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts.
  We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Yi Ho, Siyuan Liang, Sen Zhang, Yibing Zhan, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a major obstacle, particularly in high-stakes applications where factual accuracy is critical. While representation editing and reading methods have made strides in reducing hallucinations, their heavy reliance on specialised tools and training on in-domain samples, makes them difficult to scale and prone to overfitting. This limits their accuracy gains and generalizability to diverse datasets. This paper presents a lightweight method, Norm Voting (NoVo), which harnesses the untapped potential of attention head norms to dramatically enhance factual accuracy in zero-shot multiple-choice questions (MCQs). NoVo begins by automatically selecting truth-correlated head norms with an efficient, inference-only algorithm using only 30 random samples, allowing NoVo to effortlessly scale to diverse datasets. Afterwards, selected head norms are employed in a simple voting algorithm, which yields significant gains in prediction accuracy. On TruthfulQA MC1, NoVo surpasses the current state-of-the-art and all previous methods by an astounding margin -- at least 19 accuracy points. NoVo demonstrates exceptional generalization to 20 diverse datasets, with significant gains in over 90\% of them, far exceeding all current representation editing and reading methods. NoVo also reveals promising gains to finetuning strategies and building textual adversarial defence. NoVo's effectiveness with head norms opens new frontiers in LLM interpretability, robustness and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G. V. Bency Sherin, A. Abijesh Euphrine, A. Lenora Moreen, L. Arun Jose</p>
<p>Abstract: UniGlyph is a constructed language (conlang) designed to create a universal transliteration system using a script derived from seven-segment characters. The goal of UniGlyph is to facilitate cross-language communication by offering a flexible and consistent script that can represent a wide range of phonetic sounds. This paper explores the design of UniGlyph, detailing its script structure, phonetic mapping, and transliteration rules. The system addresses imperfections in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and traditional character sets by providing a compact, versatile method to represent phonetic diversity across languages. With pitch and length markers, UniGlyph ensures accurate phonetic representation while maintaining a small character set. Applications of UniGlyph include artificial intelligence integrations, such as natural language processing and multilingual speech recognition, enhancing communication across different languages. Future expansions are discussed, including the addition of animal phonetic sounds, where unique scripts are assigned to different species, broadening the scope of UniGlyph beyond human communication. This study presents the challenges and solutions in developing such a universal script, demonstrating the potential of UniGlyph to bridge linguistic gaps in cross-language communication, educational phonetics, and AI-driven applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Metaphors are everywhere. They appear extensively across all domains of natural language, from the most sophisticated poetry to seemingly dry academic prose. A significant body of research in the cognitive science of language argues for the existence of conceptual metaphors, the systematic structuring of one domain of experience in the language of another. Conceptual metaphors are not simply rhetorical flourishes but are crucial evidence of the role of analogical reasoning in human cognition. In this paper, we ask whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accurately identify and explain the presence of such conceptual metaphors in natural language data. Using a novel prompting technique based on metaphor annotation guidelines, we demonstrate that LLMs are a promising tool for large-scale computational research on conceptual metaphors. Further, we show that LLMs are able to apply procedural guidelines designed for human annotators, displaying a surprising depth of linguistic knowledge.</p>

On our LLM-elicited NLI datasets, BERT-based hypothesis-only classifiers achieve between 86-96% accuracy, indicating these datasets contain hypothesis-only artifacts. We also find frequent "give-aways" in LLM-generated hypotheses, e.g. the phrase "swimming in a pool" appears in more than 10,000 contradictions generated by GPT-4. Our analysis provides empirical evidence that well-attested biases in NLI can persist in LLM-generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yang, Zhaochen Yu, Tianjun Zhang, Minkai Xu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Bin Cui, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA have shown significant improvements in various reasoning tasks. However, smaller models such as Llama-3-8B and DeepSeekMath-Base still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning because they fail to effectively identify and correct reasoning errors. Recent reflection-based methods aim to address these issues by enabling self-reflection and self-correction, but they still face challenges in independently detecting errors in their reasoning steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose SuperCorrect, a novel two-stage framework that uses a large teacher model to supervise and correct both the reasoning and reflection processes of a smaller student model. In the first stage, we extract hierarchical high-level and detailed thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model in eliciting more fine-grained reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce cross-model collaborative direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the self-correction abilities of the student model by following the teacher's correction traces during training. This cross-model DPO approach teaches the student model to effectively locate and resolve erroneous thoughts with error-driven insights from the teacher model, breaking the bottleneck of its thoughts and acquiring new skills and knowledge to tackle challenging problems. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate our superiority over previous methods. Notably, our SuperCorrect-7B model significantly surpasses powerful DeepSeekMath-7B by 7.8%/5.3% and Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 15.1%/6.3% on MATH/GSM8K benchmarks, achieving new SOTA performance among all 7B models.

<p>Abstract: The glyphic writing system of Chinese incorporates information-rich visual features in each character, such as radicals that provide hints about meaning or pronunciation. However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language understanding tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojae Lee, Junho Kim, SangKeun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable performances across various complex tasks by leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD's effectiveness across various models and complex reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Wong, Yury Orlovskiy, Michael Luo, Sanjit A. Seshia, Joseph E. Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose \method{}, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Wang, Haoqin Tu, Jieru Mei, Bingchen Zhao, Yisen Wang, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreaking attacks, focusing specifically on the optimization-based Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) strategy. We first observe a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of the models. For instance, attacks tend to be less effective when models pay more attention to system prompts designed to ensure LLM safety alignment. Building on this discovery, we introduce an enhanced method that manipulates models' attention scores to facilitate LLM jailbreaking, which we term AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG shows consistent improvements in attack efficacy across diverse LLMs, achieving an average increase of ~7% in the Llama-2 series and ~10% in the Gemma series. Our strategy also demonstrates robust attack transferability against both unseen harmful goals and black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, we note our attention-score visualization is more interpretable, allowing us to gain better insights into how our targeted attention manipulation facilitates more effective jailbreaking. We release the code at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AttnGCG-attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Liu, Chao Shang, Ling Liu, Nikolaos Pappas, Jie Ma, Neha Anna John, Srikanth Doss, Lluis Marquez, Miguel Ballesteros, Yassine Benajiba</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Nguyen, Corinne Fredouille, Alain Ghio, Mathieu Balaguer, Virginie Woisard</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of SSL and ASR technologies, the Wav2Vec2 ASR-based model has been fine-tuned for automated speech disorder quality assessment tasks, yielding impressive results and setting a new baseline for Head and Neck Cancer speech contexts. This demonstrates that the ASR dimension from Wav2Vec2 closely aligns with assessment dimensions. Despite its effectiveness, this system remains a black box with no clear interpretation of the connection between the model ASR dimension and clinical assessments. This paper presents the first analysis of this baseline model for speech quality assessment, focusing on intelligibility and severity tasks. We conduct a layer-wise analysis to identify key layers and compare different SSL and ASR Wav2Vec2 models based on pre-trained data. Additionally, post-hoc XAI methods, including Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and visualization techniques, are used to track model evolution and visualize embeddings for enhanced interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoteng Yin, Rongzhe Wei, Eli Chien, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs offer unique insights into relationships and interactions between entities, complementing data modalities like text, images, and videos. By incorporating relational information from graph data, AI models can extend their capabilities beyond traditional tasks. However, relational data in sensitive domains such as finance and healthcare often contain private information, making privacy preservation crucial. Existing privacy-preserving methods, such as DP-SGD, which rely on gradient decoupling assumptions, are not well-suited for relational learning due to the inherent dependencies between coupled training samples. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving relational learning pipeline that decouples dependencies in sampled relations during training, ensuring differential privacy through a tailored application of DP-SGD. We apply this method to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on sensitive graph data, and tackle the associated computational complexities. Our approach is evaluated on LLMs of varying sizes (e.g., BERT, Llama2) using real-world relational data from four text-attributed graphs. The results demonstrate significant improvements in relational learning tasks, all while maintaining robust privacy guarantees during training. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and computational efficiency, offering insights into the practical deployment of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinuo Ren, Tesi Xiao, Michael Shavlovsky, Lexing Ying, Holakou Rahmanian</p>
<p>Abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e. fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose the HyperDPO framework, a hypernetwork-based approach that extends the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By substituting the Bradley-Terry-Luce model in DPO with the Plackett-Luce model, our framework is capable of handling a wide range of MOFT tasks that involve listwise ranking datasets. Compared with previous approaches, HyperDPO enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front of auxiliary objectives, and offers flexible post-training control over trade-offs. Additionally, we propose a novel Hyper Prompt Tuning design, that conveys continuous weight across objectives to transformer-based models without altering their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the HyperDPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantina Christakopoulou, Shibl Mourad, Maja Matari\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents of all kinds to interact with users through natural conversation. Consequently, agents now have two jobs: conversing and planning/reasoning. Their conversational responses must be informed by all available information, and their actions must help to achieve goals. This dichotomy between conversing with the user and doing multi-step reasoning and planning can be seen as analogous to the human systems of "thinking fast and slow" as introduced by Kahneman. Our approach is comprised of a "Talker" agent (System 1) that is fast and intuitive, and tasked with synthesizing the conversational response; and a "Reasoner" agent (System 2) that is slower, more deliberative, and more logical, and is tasked with multi-step reasoning and planning, calling tools, performing actions in the world, and thereby producing the new agent state. We describe the new Talker-Reasoner architecture and discuss its advantages, including modularity and decreased latency. We ground the discussion in the context of a sleep coaching agent, in order to demonstrate real-world relevance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushang Karia, Daniel Bramblett, Daksh Dobhal, Siddharth Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents $\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L, a novel benchmark for scaling Large Language Model (LLM) assessment in formal tasks with clear notions of correctness, such as truth maintenance in translation and logical reasoning. $\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on $\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijnan Nath, Changsoo Jung, Ethan Seefried, Nikhil Krishnaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward modeling of human preferences is one of the cornerstones of building usable generative large language models (LLMs). While traditional RLHF-based alignment methods explicitly maximize the expected rewards from a separate reward model, more recent supervised alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) circumvent this phase to avoid problems including model drift and reward overfitting. Although popular due to its simplicity, DPO and similar direct alignment methods can still lead to degenerate policies, and rely heavily on the Bradley-Terry-based preference formulation to model reward differences between pairs of candidate outputs. This formulation is challenged by non-deterministic or noisy preference labels, for example human scoring of two candidate outputs is of low confidence. In this paper, we introduce DRDO (Direct Reward Distillation and policy-Optimization), a supervised knowledge distillation-based preference alignment method that simultaneously models rewards and preferences to avoid such degeneracy. DRDO directly mimics rewards assigned by an oracle while learning human preferences from a novel preference likelihood formulation. Our experimental results on the Ultrafeedback and TL;DR datasets demonstrate that policies trained using DRDO surpass previous methods such as DPO and e-DPO in terms of expected rewards and are more robust, on average, to noisy preference signals as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunji Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Simyung Chang, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: A text encoder within Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP plays a crucial role in translating textual input into an embedding space shared with images, thereby facilitating the interpretative analysis of vision tasks through natural language. Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 7 proprietary and 6 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs the best with only 52.6% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashu He, Mingyu Derek Ma, Jinxuan Fan, Dan Roth, Wei Wang, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing retrieval-based reasoning approaches for large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on the density and quality of the non-parametric knowledge source to provide domain knowledge and explicit reasoning chain. However, inclusive knowledge sources are expensive and sometimes infeasible to build for scientific or corner domains. To tackle the challenges, we introduce Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning framework that integrates the parametric and non-parametric memories to enhance both knowledge retrieval and faithful reasoning processes on very sparse knowledge graphs. By leveraging the external structured knowledge to inspire LLM to model the interconnections among relevant concepts, our method facilitates a more logical and step-wise reasoning approach akin to experts' problem-solving, rather than gold answer retrieval. Specifically, the framework prompts LLMs to decompose the query into crucial concepts and attributes, construct entity groups with relevant entities, and build an augmented reasoning chain by probing potential relationships among node pairs across these entity groups. Our method incorporates both factual and extrapolated linkages to enable comprehensive understanding and response generation. Extensive experiments on reasoning-intense benchmarks on biomedical and commonsense QA demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, GIVE enables GPT3.5-turbo to outperform advanced models like GPT4 without any additional training cost, thereby underscoring the efficacy of integrating structured information and internal reasoning ability of LLMs for tackling specialized tasks with limited external resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Liu, Guiran Liu, Binrong Zhu, Yuanshuai Luo, Linxiao Wu, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This research addresses privacy protection in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by introducing a novel algorithm based on differential privacy, aimed at safeguarding user data in common applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. With the widespread application of NLP technology, the security and privacy protection of user data have become important issues that need to be solved urgently. This paper proposes a new privacy protection algorithm designed to effectively prevent the leakage of user sensitive information. By introducing a differential privacy mechanism, our model ensures the accuracy and reliability of data analysis results while adding random noise. This method not only reduces the risk caused by data leakage but also achieves effective processing of data while protecting user privacy. Compared to traditional privacy methods like data anonymization and homomorphic encryption, our approach offers significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability while maintaining high accuracy in data analysis. The proposed algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated through performance metrics such as accuracy (0.89), precision (0.85), and recall (0.88), outperforming other methods in balancing privacy and utility. As privacy protection regulations become increasingly stringent, enterprises and developers must take effective measures to deal with privacy risks. Our research provides an important reference for the application of privacy protection technology in the field of NLP, emphasizing the need to achieve a balance between technological innovation and user privacy. In the future, with the continuous advancement of technology, privacy protection will become a core element of data-driven applications and promote the healthy development of the entire industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Unai Ruiz-Gonzalez, Alain Andres, Pedro G. Bascoy, Javier Del Ser</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse reward environments in reinforcement learning (RL) pose significant challenges for exploration, often leading to inefficient or incomplete learning processes. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a teacher-student RL framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as "teachers" to guide the agent's learning process by decomposing complex tasks into subgoals. Due to their inherent capability to understand RL environments based on a textual description of structure and purpose, LLMs can provide subgoals to accomplish the task defined for the environment in a similar fashion to how a human would do. In doing so, three types of subgoals are proposed: positional targets relative to the agent, object representations, and language-based instructions generated directly by the LLM. More importantly, we show that it is possible to query the LLM only during the training phase, enabling agents to operate within the environment without any LLM intervention. We assess the performance of this proposed framework by evaluating three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen) eliciting subgoals across various procedurally generated environment of the MiniGrid benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that this curriculum-based approach accelerates learning and enhances exploration in complex tasks, achieving up to 30 to 200 times faster convergence in training steps compared to recent baselines designed for sparse reward environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on conspiracy theories and related content online has traditionally focused on textual data. To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. Our research contributes to this field by exploring the potential of multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. Our work uses the BERTopic topic modeling approach in combination with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data. We analyze a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories and other deceptive content. We explore the potentials and challenges of this approach for studying a medium-sized corpus of user-generated, text-image online content. We offer insights into the dominant topics across modalities, different text and image genres discovered during the analysis, quantitative inter-modal topic analyses, and a qualitative case study of textual, visual, and multimodal narrative strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference learning is a central component for aligning current LLMs, but this process can be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. To address this concern, we introduce PoisonBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' susceptibility to data poisoning during preference learning. Data poisoning attacks can manipulate large language model responses to include hidden malicious content or biases, potentially causing the model to generate harmful or unintended outputs while appearing to function normally. We deploy two distinct attack types across eight realistic scenarios, assessing 21 widely-used models. Our findings reveal concerning trends: (1) Scaling up parameter size does not inherently enhance resilience against poisoning attacks; (2) There exists a log-linear relationship between the effects of the attack and the data poison ratio; (3) The effect of data poisoning can generalize to extrapolated triggers that are not included in the poisoned data. These results expose weaknesses in current preference learning techniques, highlighting the urgent need for more robust defenses against malicious models and data manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In times of crisis, the prompt and precise classification of disaster-related information shared on social media platforms is crucial for effective disaster response and public safety. During such critical events, individuals use social media to communicate, sharing multimodal textual and visual content. However, due to the significant influx of unfiltered and diverse data, humanitarian organizations face challenges in leveraging this information efficiently. Existing methods for classifying disaster-related content often fail to model users' credibility, emotional context, and social interaction information, which are essential for accurate classification. To address this gap, we propose CrisisSpot, a method that utilizes a Graph-based Neural Network to capture complex relationships between textual and visual modalities, as well as Social Context Features to incorporate user-centric and content-centric information. We also introduce Inverted Dual Embedded Attention (IDEA), which captures both harmonious and contrasting patterns within the data to enhance multimodal interactions and provide richer insights. Additionally, we present TSEqD (Turkey-Syria Earthquake Dataset), a large annotated dataset for a single disaster event, containing 10,352 samples. Through extensive experiments, CrisisSpot demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an average F1-score gain of 9.45% and 5.01% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available CrisisMMD dataset and the TSEqD dataset, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Ni, Yu Wang, Lu Cheng, Erik Blasch, Tyler Derr</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been successfully coupled with Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate their hallucinations and enhance their reasoning capability, such as in KG-based retrieval-augmented frameworks. However, current KG-LLM frameworks lack rigorous uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliable deployment in high-stakes applications. Directly incorporating uncertainty quantification into KG-LLM frameworks presents challenges due to their complex architectures and the intricate interactions between the knowledge graph and language model components. To address this gap, we propose a new trustworthy KG-LLM framework, Uncertainty Aware Knowledge-Graph Reasoning (UAG), which incorporates uncertainty quantification into the KG-LLM framework. We design an uncertainty-aware multi-step reasoning framework that leverages conformal prediction to provide a theoretical guarantee on the prediction set. To manage the error rate of the multi-step process, we additionally introduce an error rate control module to adjust the error rate within the individual components. Extensive experiments show that our proposed UAG can achieve any pre-defined coverage rate while reducing the prediction set/interval size by 40% on average over the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Galim, Wonjun Kang, Yuchen Zeng, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2024), have emerged as powerful tools for language modeling, offering high performance with efficient inference and linear scaling in sequence length. However, the application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to SSM-based models remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to systematically study two key questions: (i) How do existing PEFT methods perform on SSM-based models? (ii) Which modules are most effective for fine-tuning? We conduct an empirical benchmark of four basic PEFT methods on SSM-based models. Our findings reveal that prompt-based methods (e.g., prefix-tuning) are no longer effective, an empirical result further supported by theoretical analysis. In contrast, LoRA remains effective for SSM-based models. We further investigate the optimal application of LoRA within these models, demonstrating both theoretically and experimentally that applying LoRA to linear projection matrices without modifying SSM modules yields the best results, as LoRA is not effective at tuning SSM modules. To further improve performance, we introduce LoRA with Selective Dimension tuning (SDLoRA), which selectively updates certain channels and states on SSM modules while applying LoRA to linear projection matrices. Extensive experimental results show that this approach outperforms standard LoRA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents. We publicly release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Yin, Chuqiao Shi, Yimo Han, Yi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ptychography is an advanced computational imaging technique in X-ray and electron microscopy. It has been widely adopted across scientific research fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well as in industrial applications such as semiconductor characterization. In practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters. Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the "Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot" (PEAR), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B. PEAR also supports various automation levels and is designed to work with customized local knowledge bases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across different research environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of inflammatory or misleading "fake" news content has become increasingly common in recent years. Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. We release our code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi'ou Zheng, Xiaodan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning has been a central topic in artificial intelligence from the beginning. The recent progress made on distributed representation and neural networks continues to improve the state-of-the-art performance of natural language inference. However, it remains an open question whether the models perform real reasoning to reach their conclusions or rely on spurious correlations. Adversarial attacks have proven to be an important tool to help evaluate the Achilles' heel of the victim models. In this study, we explore the fundamental problem of developing attack models based on logic formalism. We propose NatLogAttack to perform systematic attacks centring around natural logic, a classical logic formalism that is traceable back to Aristotle's syllogism and has been closely developed for natural language inference. The proposed framework renders both label-preserving and label-flipping attacks. We show that compared to the existing attack models, NatLogAttack generates better adversarial examples with fewer visits to the victim models. The victim models are found to be more vulnerable under the label-flipping setting. NatLogAttack provides a tool to probe the existing and future NLI models' capacity from a key viewpoint and we hope more logic-based attacks will be further explored for understanding the desired property of reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zecheng Tang, Keyan Zhou, Juntao Li, Yuyang Ding, Pinzheng Wang, Bowen Yan, Rejie Hua, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text detoxification aims to minimize the risk of language models producing toxic content. Existing detoxification methods of directly constraining the model output or further training the model on the non-toxic corpus fail to achieve a decent balance between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality. This issue stems from the neglect of constrain imposed by the context since language models are designed to generate output that closely matches the context while detoxification methods endeavor to ensure the safety of the output even if it semantically deviates from the context. In view of this, we introduce a Context-aware Model self-Detoxification~(CMD) framework that pays attention to both the context and the detoxification process, i.e., first detoxifying the context and then making the language model generate along the safe context. Specifically, CMD framework involves two phases: utilizing language models to synthesize data and applying these data for training. We also introduce a toxic contrastive loss that encourages the model generation away from the negative toxic samples. Experiments on various LLMs have verified the effectiveness of our MSD framework, which can yield the best performance compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew M. Bean, Karolina Korgul, Felix Krones, Robert McCraith, Adam Mahdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid improvement on medical benchmarks, but their unreliability remains a persistent challenge for safe real-world uses. To design for the use LLMs as a category, rather than for specific models, requires developing an understanding of shared strengths and weaknesses which appear across models. To address this challenge, we benchmark a range of top LLMs and identify consistent patterns across models. We test $16$ well-known LLMs on $874$ newly collected questions from Polish medical licensing exams. For each question, we score each model on the top-1 accuracy and the distribution of probabilities assigned. We then compare these results with factors such as question difficulty for humans, question length, and the scores of the other models. LLM accuracies were positively correlated pairwise ($0.39$ to $0.58$). Model performance was also correlated with human performance ($0.09$ to $0.13$), but negatively correlated to the difference between the question-level accuracy of top-scoring and bottom-scoring humans ($-0.09$ to $-0.14$). The top output probability and question length were positive and negative predictors of accuracy respectively (p$< 0.05$). The top scoring LLM, GPT-4o Turbo, scored $84\%$, with Claude Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3/3.1 between $74\%$ and $79\%$. We found evidence of similarities between models in which questions they answer correctly, as well as similarities with human test takers. Larger models typically performed better, but differences in training, architecture, and data were also highly impactful. Model accuracy was positively correlated with confidence, but negatively correlated with question length. We find similar results with older models, and argue that these patterns are likely to persist across future models using similar training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study compares the performance of (1) fine-tuned language models and (2) large language models on the task of check-worthy claim detection. For the purpose of the comparison we composed a multilingual and multi-topical dataset comprising texts of various sources and styles. Building on this, we performed a benchmark analysis to determine the most general multilingual and multi-topical claim detector.
  We chose three state-of-the-art models in the check-worthy claim detection task and fine-tuned them. Furthermore, we selected four state-of-the-art large language models without any fine-tuning. We made modifications to the models to adapt them for multilingual settings and through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we assessed the performance of all the models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score in in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Our results demonstrate that despite the technological progress in the area of natural language processing, the models fine-tuned for the task of check-worthy claim detection still outperform the zero-shot approaches in cross-domain settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra Chronopoulou, Jonas Pfeiffer, Joshua Maynez, Xinyi Wang, Sebastian Ruder, Priyanka Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using labeled task data can significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on the downstream task. However, there are 7000 languages in the world and many of these languages lack labeled data for real-world language generation tasks. In this paper, we propose to improve zero-shot cross-lingual transfer by composing language or task specialized parameters. Our method composes language and task PEFT modules via element-wise arithmetic operations to leverage unlabeled data and English labeled data. We extend our approach to cases where labeled data from more languages is available and propose to arithmetically compose PEFT modules trained on languages related to the target. Empirical results on summarization demonstrate that our method is an effective strategy that obtains consistent gains using minimal training of PEFT modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recent research indicates that moderately-sized LLMs often outperform larger ones after task-specific fine-tuning. This study focuses on adapting LLMs for document-level machine translation (DocMT) for specific language pairs. We first investigate the impact of prompt strategies on translation performance and then conduct extensive experiments using two fine-tuning methods, three LLM backbones, and 18 translation tasks across nine language pairs. Our results show that specialized models can sometimes surpass GPT-4 in translation performance but still face issues like off-target translation due to error propagation in decoding. We provide an in-depth analysis of these LLMs tailored for DocMT, examining translation errors, discourse phenomena, strategies for training and inference, the data efficiency of parallel documents, recent test set evaluations, and zero-shot crosslingual transfer. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLM-based DocMT models and provide a foundation for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The distractor generation task focuses on generating incorrect but plausible options for objective questions such as fill-in-the-blank and multiple-choice questions. This task is widely utilized in educational settings across various domains and subjects. The effectiveness of these questions in assessments relies on the quality of the distractors, as they challenge examinees to select the correct answer from a set of misleading options. The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has transitioned the task from traditional methods to the use of neural networks and pre-trained language models. This shift has established new benchmarks and expanded the use of advanced deep learning methods in generating distractors. This survey explores distractor generation tasks, datasets, methods, and current evaluation metrics for English objective questions, covering both text-based and multi-modal domains. It also evaluates existing AI models and benchmarks and discusses potential future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans, particularly in reasoning tasks. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more "familiar" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the "familiarity" and our conclusion reveals that this "familiarity" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Approaches to improving multilingual language understanding often struggle with significant performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages. While there are efforts to align the languages in a single latent space to mitigate such gaps, how different input-level representations influence such gaps has not been investigated, particularly with phonemic inputs. We hypothesize that the performance gaps are affected by representation discrepancies between these languages, and revisit the use of phonemic representations as a means to mitigate these discrepancies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, we present experiments on three representative cross-lingual tasks on 12 languages in total. The results show that phonemic representations exhibit higher similarities between languages compared to orthographic representations, and it consistently outperforms grapheme-based baseline model on languages that are relatively low-resourced. We present quantitative evidence from three cross-lingual tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, and it is further justified by a theoretical analysis of the cross-lingual performance gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the "3H" (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introducing diverse data and alignment goals, we surpass baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the alignment tax and achieving improvements in multi-objective alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Toroghi, Willis Guo, Mohammad Mahdi Abdollah Pour, Scott Sanner</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods seek to answer Natural Language questions using the relational information stored in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., "In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.</p>

However, in this study, we discovered that many layers of LLMs exhibit high similarity, and some layers play a negligible role in network functionality. Based on this observation, we define a metric called Block Influence (BI) to gauge the significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments demonstrate that our method, which we call ShortGPT, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning. Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling further reduction in parameters and computation. The ability to achieve better results through simple layer removal, as opposed to more complex pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy in the model architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeel Sandeep Nachane, Ojas Gramopadhye, Prateek Chanda, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Kshitij Sharad Jadhav, Yatin Nandwani, Dinesh Raghu, Sachindra Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified version of the MedQA-USMLE dataset, named MEDQA-OPEN, which contains open-ended medical questions without options to mimic clinical scenarios, along with clinician-approved reasoned answers. Additionally, we implement a prompt driven by Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, CLINICR, to mirror the prospective process of incremental reasoning, reaching a correct response to medical questions. We empirically demonstrate how CLINICR outperforms the state-of-the-art 5-shot CoT-based prompt (Li\'evin et al., 2022). We also present an approach that mirrors real-life clinical practice by first exploring multiple differential diagnoses through MCQ-CLINICR and subsequently narrowing down to a final diagnosis using MCQ-ELIMINATIVE. Finally, emphasizing the importance of response verification in medical settings, we utilize a reward model mechanism, replacing the elimination process performed by MCQ-ELIMINATIVE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiyi Li, Yang Deng, Deng Cai, Hongyuan Lu, Liang Chen, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: As the typical retraining paradigm is unacceptably time- and resource-consuming, researchers are turning to model editing to find an effective way that supports both consecutive and batch scenarios to edit the model behavior directly. Despite all these practical expectations, existing model editing methods fail to realize all of them. Furthermore, the memory demands for such sequential model editing approaches tend to be prohibitive, frequently necessitating an external memory that grows incrementally over time. To cope with these challenges, we propose CoachHooK, a model editing method that simultaneously supports sequential and batch editing. CoachHooK is memory-friendly as it only needs a small amount of it to store several hook layers whose size remains unchanged over time. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other batch-supportive model editing methods under both single-round and consecutive batch editing scenarios. Extensive analyses of CoachHooK have been conducted to verify the stability of our method over a number of consecutive steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lydia Uhler, Verena Jordan, J\"urgen Buder, Markus Huff, Frank Papenmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligences, especially large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being used, necessitating transparency about their capabilities. While prior studies have shown addition biases in humans (Adams et al., 2021) and OpenAI's GPT-3 (Winter et al., 2023), this study extends the research by comparing human and GPT-4 problem-solving across both spatial and linguistic tasks, with variations in solution efficiency and valence of task instruction. Four preregistered experiments with 588 participants from the U.S. and 680 GPT-4 iterations revealed a stronger tendency towards additive transformations in GPT-4 than in humans. Human participants were less likely to use additive strategies when subtraction was relatively more efficient than when addition and subtraction were equally efficient. GPT-4 exhibited the opposite behavior, with a strong addition bias when subtraction was more efficient. In terms of valence of task instruction, GPT-4's use of additive strategies increased when instructed to "improve" (positive valence) rather than "edit" (neutral valence). These findings demonstrate that biases in human problem-solving are amplified in the outputs of GPT-4, and that LLM's solution strategies differ from human efficiency-based strategies. This highlights the evolving limitations of LLMs and the need for caution when using them in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A. Dennis, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language explanations represent a proxy for evaluating explanation-based and multi-step Natural Language Inference (NLI) models. However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that integrates TPs with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning, autoformalisation, and error correction mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs as well as to automatically enhance the quality of explanations of variable complexity in different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Ajwani, Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Frank Rudzicz, Zining Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of the black-box explanation setting and allow us to provide advice on the safe usage of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressing lengthy context is a critical but technically challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new method called UltraGist, which is distinguished for its high-quality compression of lengthy context due to the innovative design of the compression and learning algorithm. UltraGist brings forth the following important benefits. Firstly, it notably contributes to the flexibility of compression, as it can be effectively learned to support a broad range of context lengths and compression ratios. Secondly, it helps to produce fine-grained compression for the lengthy context, where each small segment of the context is progressively processed on top of a tailored cross-attention mechanism. Thirdly, it makes the training process sample-efficient and thus maximizes the use of training data. Finally, it facilitates the efficient running of compression for dynamic context, as the compression result can be progressively generated and hence incrementally updated. UltraGist is evaluated on a wide variety of tasks associated with lengthy context, such as document QA and summarization, few-shot learning, multi-session conversation, et al. Whilst the existing methods fail to handle these challenging scenarios, our approach is able to preserve a near-lossless compression performance throughout all the evaluations. Our data, model, and code have been released at \url{https://github.com/namespace-Pt/UltraGist}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Rahn, Pierluca D'Oro, Marc G. Bellemare</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. At the core of agentic behavior is the capacity for exploration, or the ability to actively gather information about the environment. But how do LLM agents explore, and how can we control their exploratory behaviors? To answer these questions, we take a representation-level perspective, and introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. Firstly, we demonstrate that EAST can effectively manipulate an LLM agent's exploration by directly affecting the high-level actions parsed from the outputs of the LLM, in contrast to token-level temperature sampling. Secondly, we reveal how applying this control modulates the uncertainty exhibited in the LLM's thoughts, guiding the agent towards more exploratory actions. Finally, we demonstrate that the steering vectors obtained by EAST generalize across task variants. In total, these results show that LLM agents explicitly encode uncertainty over their actions in their representation space. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of the functioning of LLM agents and to effective control of their decision-making behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aman Singh Thakur, Kartik Choudhary, Venkat Srinik Ramayapally, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, Dieuwke Hupkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to understand and reason about spatial relationships between objects in images is an important component of visual reasoning. This skill rests on the ability to recognize and localize objects of interest and determine their spatial relation. Early vision and language models (VLMs) have been shown to struggle to recognize spatial relations. We extend the previously released What'sUp dataset and propose a novel comprehensive evaluation for spatial relationship understanding that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of 27 different models. In addition to the VLMs evaluated in What'sUp, our extensive evaluation encompasses 3 classes of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that vary in their parameter sizes (ranging from 7B to 110B), training/instruction-tuning methods, and visual resolution to benchmark their performances and scrutinize the scaling laws in this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungbin Shin, Wonpyo Park, Jaeho Lee, Namhoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This work suggests fundamentally rethinking the current practice of pruning large language models (LLMs). The way it is done is by divide and conquer: split the model into submodels, sequentially prune them, and reconstruct predictions of the dense counterparts on small calibration data one at a time; the final model is obtained simply by putting the resulting sparse submodels together. While this approach enables pruning under memory constraints, it generates high reconstruction errors. In this work, we first present an array of reconstruction techniques that can significantly reduce this error by more than $90\%$. Unwittingly, however, we discover that minimizing reconstruction error is not always ideal and can overfit the given calibration data, resulting in rather increased language perplexity and poor performance at downstream tasks. We find out that a strategy of self-generating calibration data can mitigate this trade-off between reconstruction and generalization, suggesting new directions in the presence of both benefits and pitfalls of reconstruction for pruning LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangbin Feng, Weijia Shi, Yike Wang, Wenxuan Ding, Orevaoghene Ahia, Shuyue Stella Li, Vidhisha Balachandran, Sunayana Sitaram, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual LLMs often have knowledge disparities across languages, with larger gaps in under-resourced languages. Teaching LLMs to abstain in the face of knowledge gaps is thus a promising strategy to mitigate hallucinations in multilingual settings. However, previous studies on LLM abstention primarily focus on English; we find that directly applying existing solutions beyond English results in up to 20.5% performance gaps between high and low-resource languages, potentially due to LLMs' drop in calibration and reasoning beyond a few resource-rich languages. To this end, we propose strategies to enhance LLM abstention by learning from multilingual feedback, where LLMs self-reflect on proposed answers in one language by generating multiple feedback items in related languages: we show that this helps identifying the knowledge gaps across diverse languages, cultures, and communities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our multilingual feedback approach outperforms various strong baselines, achieving up to 9.2% improvement for low-resource languages across three black-box and open models on three datasets, featuring open-book, closed-book, and commonsense QA. Further analysis reveals that multilingual feedback is both an effective and a more equitable abstain strategy to serve diverse language speakers, and cultural factors have great impact on language selection and LLM abstention behavior, highlighting future directions for multilingual and multi-cultural reliable language modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: While existing alignment paradigms have been integral in developing large language models (LLMs), LLMs often learn an averaged human preference and struggle to model diverse preferences across cultures, demographics, and communities. We propose Modular Pluralism, a modular framework based on multi-LLM collaboration for pluralistic alignment: it "plugs into" a base LLM a pool of smaller but specialized community LMs, where models collaborate in distinct modes to flexibility support three modes of pluralism: Overton, steerable, and distributional. Modular Pluralism is uniquely compatible with black-box LLMs and offers the modular control of adding new community LMs for previously underrepresented communities. We evaluate Modular Pluralism with six tasks and four datasets featuring questions/instructions with value-laden and perspective-informed responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Modular Pluralism advances the three pluralism objectives across six black-box and open-source LLMs. Further analysis reveals that LLMs are generally faithful to the inputs from smaller community LLMs, allowing seamless patching by adding a new community LM to better cover previously underrepresented communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhuo Zhang, Heng Wang, Shangbin Feng, Zhaoxuan Tan, Xiaochuang Han, Tianxing He, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate great potential for problems with implicit graphical structures, while recent works seek to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs through specialized instruction tuning. The resulting 'graph LLMs' are evaluated with in-distribution settings only, thus it remains underexplored whether LLMs are learning generalizable graph reasoning skills or merely memorizing patterns in the synthetic training data. To this end, we propose the NLGift benchmark, an evaluation suite of LLM graph reasoning generalization: whether LLMs could go beyond semantic, numeric, structural, reasoning patterns in the synthetic training data and improve utility on real-world graph-based tasks. Extensive experiments with two LLMs across four graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that while generalization on simple patterns (semantic, numeric) is somewhat satisfactory, LLMs struggle to generalize across reasoning and real-world patterns, casting doubt on the benefit of synthetic graph tuning for real-world tasks with underlying network structures. We explore three strategies to improve LLM graph reasoning generalization, and we find that while post-training alignment is most promising for real-world tasks, empowering LLM graph reasoning to go beyond pattern memorization remains an open research question.</p>

<p>Abstract: Iterative preference learning, though yielding superior performances, requires online annotated preference labels. In this work, we study strategies to select worth-annotating response pairs for cost-efficient annotation while achieving competitive or even better performances compared with the random selection baseline for iterative preference learning. Built on assumptions regarding uncertainty and distribution shifts, we propose a comparative view to rank the implicit reward margins as predicted by DPO to select the response pairs that yield more benefits. Through extensive experiments, we show that annotating those response pairs with small margins is generally better than large or random, under both single- and multi-iteration scenarios. Besides, our empirical results suggest allocating more annotation budgets in the earlier iterations rather than later across multiple iterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on diverse data, including potentially copyrighted material. These models can memorize and generate content similar to their training data, posing potential concerns. Therefore, model creators are motivated to develop mitigation methods that prevent generating protected content.

We examine several strategies, including adding system prompts, decoding-time filtering interventions, and unlearning approaches. Our findings indicate that no tested method excels across all metrics, showing significant room for research in this unique problem setting and indicating potential unresolved challenges for live policy proposals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now generate and recognize poetry. But what do LLMs really know about poetry? We develop a task to evaluate how well LLMs recognize one aspect of English-language poetry--poetic form--which captures many different poetic features, including rhyme scheme, meter, and word or line repetition. By using a benchmark dataset of over 4.1k human expert-annotated poems, we show that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully identify both common and uncommon fixed poetic forms--such as sonnets, sestinas, and pantoums--with surprisingly high accuracy. However, performance varies significantly by poetic form; the models struggle to identify unfixed poetic forms, especially those based on topic or visual features. We additionally measure how many poems from our benchmark dataset are present in popular pretraining datasets or memorized by GPT-4, finding that pretraining presence and memorization may improve performance on this task, but results are inconclusive. We release a benchmark evaluation dataset with 1.4k public domain poems and form annotations, results of memorization experiments and data audits, and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanqi Cheng, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore multi-step reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). The problem is challenging, as reasoning data consisting of multiple steps of visual and language processing are barely available. To overcome the challenge, we first introduce a least-to-most visual reasoning paradigm, which interleaves steps of decomposing a question into sub-questions and invoking external tools for resolving sub-questions. Based on the paradigm, we further propose a novel data synthesis approach that can automatically create questions and multi-step reasoning paths for an image in a bottom-up manner. Our approach divides the complex synthesis task into a few simple sub-tasks, and (almost entirely) relies on open-sourced models to accomplish the sub-tasks. Therefore, the entire synthesis process is reproducible and cost-efficient, and the synthesized data is quality guaranteed. With the approach, we construct $50$k visual reasoning examples. Then, we develop a visual reasoner through supervised fine-tuning, which is capable of generally enhancing the reasoning abilities of a wide range of existing VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments indicate that the visual reasoner can consistently and significantly improve four VLMs on four VQA benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheridan Feucht, David Atkinson, Byron Wallace, David Bau</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b's tokenizer splits the word "northeastern" into the tokens ['_n', 'ort', 'he', 'astern'], none of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like "north" or "east." Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like "Neil Young" and multi-word expressions like "break a leg" cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced "erasure" effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to "read out" the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in computational linguistics include simulating the emergence of human-like languages with interacting neural network agents, starting from sets of random symbols. The recently introduced NeLLCom framework (Lian et al., 2023) allows agents to first learn an artificial language and then use it to communicate, with the aim of studying the emergence of specific linguistics properties. We extend this framework (NeLLCom-X) by introducing more realistic role-alternating agents and group communication in order to investigate the interplay between language learnability, communication pressures, and group size effects. We validate NeLLCom-X by replicating key findings from prior research simulating the emergence of a word-order/case-marking trade-off. Next, we investigate how interaction affects linguistic convergence and emergence of the trade-off. The novel framework facilitates future simulations of diverse linguistic aspects, emphasizing the importance of interaction and group dynamics in language evolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Khai Le-Duc, Bach Phan Tat, Duy Le, Long Vo-Dang, Truong-Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial for building trust among AI and users. Incorporating reasoning capabilities enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand emotions in context, handle nuanced language, and infer unstated sentiments. In this work, we introduce a new task -- Sentiment Reasoning -- for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model performance (1% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Xu, Xiuyuan Qi, Zhan Qin, Wenjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend the capacity of LLMs to understand multimodal information comprehensively, achieving remarkable performance in many vision-centric tasks. Despite that, recent studies have shown that these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which refer to an exploitative technique where malicious users can break the safety alignment of the target model and generate misleading and harmful answers. This potential threat is caused by both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLM and the larger attack scope introduced by vision input. To enhance the security of MLLMs against jailbreak attacks, researchers have developed various defense techniques. However, these methods either require modifications to the model's internal structure or demand significant computational resources during the inference phase. Multimodal information is a double-edged sword. While it increases the risk of attacks, it also provides additional data that can enhance safeguards. Inspired by this, we propose Cross-modality Information DEtectoR (CIDER), a plug-and-play jailbreaking detector designed to identify maliciously perturbed image inputs, utilizing the cross-modal similarity between harmful queries and adversarial images. CIDER is independent of the target MLLMs and requires less computation cost. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CIDER, as well as its transferability to both white-box and black-box MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangzhi Xiong, Qiao Jin, Xiao Wang, Minjia Zhang, Zhiyong Lu, Aidong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in solving medical questions. They can possess considerable medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a conventional RAG system and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs brought by i-MedRAG compared with conventional RAG on complex questions from clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all existing prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods on GPT-3.5, achieving an accuracy of 69.68% on the MedQA dataset. In addition, we characterize the scaling properties of i-MedRAG with different iterations of follow-up queries and different numbers of queries per iteration. Our case studies show that i-MedRAG can flexibly ask follow-up queries to form reasoning chains, providing an in-depth analysis of medical questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind study on incorporating follow-up queries into medical RAG. The implementation of i-MedRAG is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/MedRAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenwei Wan, Matthieu Labeau, Chlo\'e Clavel</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gracjan G\'oral, Emilia Wi\'snios, Piotr Sankowski, Pawe{\l} Budzianowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making under full alignment requires balancing between reasoning and faithfulness - a challenge for large language models (LLMs). This study explores whether LLMs prioritize following instructions over reasoning and truth when given "misleading" instructions, such as "Respond solely with A or B", even when neither option is correct. We introduce a new metric called "reflective judgment", which sheds new light on the relationship between the pre-training and post-training alignment schemes. In tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to domain-specific assessments, models like GPT-4o, o1-mini, or Claude 3 Opus adhered to instructions correctly but failed to reflect on the validity of the provided options. Contrary, models from the Llama 3.1 family (8B, 70B, 405B) or base Qwen2.5 (7B, 14B, 32B) families exhibit improved refusal rates with size, indicating a scaling effect. We also observed that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance reasoning, sometimes weakened the models' ability to reject incorrect instructions, leading them to follow flawed prompts uncritically. Finally, we have also conducted a parallel human study revealing similar patterns in human behavior and annotations. We highlight how popular RLHF datasets might disrupt either training or evaluation due to annotations exhibiting poor reflective judgement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erwan Le Merrer, Gilles Tredan</p>
<p>Abstract: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a statement; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maojia Song, Shang Hong Sim, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Hai Leong Chieu, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. The LLaMA-3 family, aligned using our method, significantly outperforms open-source LLMs of similar sizes on ASQA (up 14.0), QAMPARI (up 28.9), and ELI5 (up 13.7). We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trust-align}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Castillo-Bolado, Joseph Davidson, Finlay Gray, Marek Rosa</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a dynamic benchmarking system for conversational agents that evaluates their performance through a single, simulated, and lengthy user$\leftrightarrow$agent interaction. The interaction is a conversation between the user and agent, where multiple tasks are introduced and then undertaken concurrently. We context switch regularly to interleave the tasks, which constructs a realistic testing scenario in which we assess the Long-Term Memory, Continual Learning, and Information Integration capabilities of the agents. Results from both proprietary and open-source Large-Language Models show that LLMs in general perform well on single-task interactions, but they struggle on the same tasks when they are interleaved. Notably, short-context LLMs supplemented with an LTM system perform as well as or better than those with larger contexts. Our benchmark suggests that there are other challenges for LLMs responding to more natural interactions that contemporary benchmarks have heretofore not been able to capture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Miner, Yoshiki Takashima, Simeng Han, Ferhat Erata, Timos Antonopoulos, Ruzica Piskac, Scott J Shapiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are critical for measuring progress of math reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing widely-used benchmarks such as GSM8K have been rendered less useful as multiple cutting-edge LLMs achieve over 94% accuracy. While harder benchmarks have been proposed, their creation is often manual and expensive. We present Scheherazade, an automated approach for producing challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks by logically chaining mathematical reasoning problems. We propose two different chaining methods, forward chaining and backward chaining, which require reasoning forward and backward through the chain respectively. We apply Scheherazade on GSM8K to create GSM8K-Scheherazade and evaluate 3 frontier LLMs and OpenAI's o1-preview on it. We show that while frontier models' performance declines precipitously at only a few questions chained, a preliminary evaluation suggests o1-preview performance persists up to 5 questions chained backwards. In addition, while all other models perform worse when problems are chained backwards, o1-preview performs better on backward-chained benchmarks. We will release the dataset and code publicly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is the task of assigning labels to a text within a structured space organized as a hierarchy. Recent works treat HTC as a conventional multilabel classification problem, therefore evaluating it as such. We instead propose to evaluate models based on specifically designed hierarchical metrics and we demonstrate the intricacy of metric choice and prediction inference method. We introduce a new challenging dataset and we evaluate fairly, recent sophisticated models, comparing them with a range of simple but strong baselines, including a new theoretically motivated loss. Finally, we show that those baselines are very often competitive with the latest models. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the evaluation methodology when proposing new methods for HTC.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitian Gao, Boye Niu, Xuzheng He, Haotian Xu, Hongzhang Liu, Aiwei Liu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose SC-MCTS*: a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and speed. Our motivation comes from: 1. Previous MCTS LLM reasoning works often overlooked its biggest drawback--slower speed compared to CoT; 2. Previous research mainly used MCTS as a tool for LLM reasoning on various tasks with limited quantitative analysis or ablation studies of its components from reasoning interpretability perspective. 3. The reward model is the most crucial component in MCTS, however previous work has rarely conducted in-depth study or improvement of MCTS's reward models. Thus, we conducted extensive ablation studies and quantitative analysis on components of MCTS, revealing the impact of each component on the MCTS reasoning performance of LLMs. Building on this, (i) we designed a highly interpretable reward model based on the principle of contrastive decoding and (ii) achieved an average speed improvement of 51.9% per node using speculative decoding. Additionally, (iii) we improved UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation used in previous works, resulting in significant performance improvement. We outperformed o1-mini by an average of 17.4% on the Blocksworld multi-step reasoning dataset using Llama-3.1-70B with SC-MCTS*.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangwei Zhu, Dian Li, Jiajun Huang, Gang Liu, Hui Wang, Zhifang Sui</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development in the performance of large language models (LLMs) is accompanied by the escalation of model size, leading to the increasing cost of model training and inference. Previous research has discovered that certain layers in LLMs exhibit redundancy, and removing these layers brings only marginal loss in model performance. In this paper, we adopt the probing technique to explain the layer redundancy in LLMs and demonstrate that language models can be effectively pruned with probing classifiers. We propose chip-tuning, a simple and effective structured pruning framework specialized for classification problems. Chip-tuning attaches tiny probing classifiers named chips to different layers of LLMs, and trains chips with the backbone model frozen. After selecting a chip for classification, all layers subsequent to the attached layer could be removed with marginal performance loss. Experimental results on various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that chip-tuning significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and pruning ratio, achieving a pruning ratio of up to 50%. We also find that chip-tuning could be applied on multimodal models, and could be combined with model finetuning, proving its excellent compatibility.</p>

Second, examples in DA-Code are all based on real and diverse data, covering a wide range of complex data wrangling and analytics tasks. Third, to solve the tasks, the models must utilize complex data science programming languages, to perform intricate data processing and derive the answers. We set up the benchmark in a controllable and executable environment that aligns with real-world data analysis scenarios and is scalable. The annotators meticulously design the evaluation suite to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation. We develop the DA-Agent baseline.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, existing benchmarks like GSM8K or MATH are now being solved with high accuracy (e.g., OpenAI o1 achieves 94.8% on MATH dataset), indicating their inadequacy for truly challenging these models. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' mathematical reasoning at the Olympiad level. Unlike existing Olympiad-related benchmarks, our dataset focuses exclusively on mathematics and comprises a vast collection of 4428 competition-level problems with rigorous human annotation. These problems are meticulously categorized into over 33 sub-domains and span more than 10 distinct difficulty levels, enabling a holistic assessment of model performance in Olympiad-mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis based on this benchmark. Our experimental results show that even the most advanced models, OpenAI o1-mini and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with highly challenging Olympiad-level problems, with 60.54% and 52.55% accuracy, highlighting significant challenges in Olympiad-level mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongxiang Wang, Felix Xiaozhu Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern speech understanding (SU) runs a sophisticated pipeline: ingesting streaming voice input, the pipeline executes encoder-decoder based deep neural networks repeatedly; by doing so, the pipeline generates tentative outputs (called hypotheses), and periodically scores the hypotheses. This paper sets to accelerate SU on resource-constrained edge devices. It takes a hybrid approach: to speed up on-device execution; to offload inputs that are beyond the device's capacity. While the approach is well-known, we address SU's unique challenges with novel techniques: (1) late contextualization, which executes a model's attentive encoder in parallel to the input ingestion; (2) pilot inference, which mitigates the SU pipeline's temporal load imbalance; (3) autoregression offramps, which evaluate offloading decisions based on pilot inferences and hypotheses. Our techniques are compatible with existing speech models, pipelines, and frameworks; they can be applied independently or in combination. Our prototype, called PASU, is tested on Arm platforms with 6 - 8 cores: it delivers SOTA accuracy; it reduces the end-to-end latency by 2x and reduces the offloading needs by 2x.</p>

<p>Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling inference-time reasoning, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Zhang, Licong Lin, Yu Bai, Song Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often memorize sensitive, private, or copyrighted data during pre-training. LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model's utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse -- a drastic degradation of the model's utilities.
  In this paper, we propose Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired method that could efficiently and effectively unlearn a target dataset. We theoretically show that the progression toward catastrophic collapse by minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than GA. Through experiments on synthetic data and the benchmark TOFU dataset, we demonstrate that NPO-based methods achieve a better balance between unlearning the undesirable data and maintaining the model's utilities. We also observe that NPO-based methods generate more sensible outputs than GA-based methods, whose outputs are often gibberish. Remarkably, on TOFU, NPO-based methods are the first to achieve reasonable unlearning results in forgetting 50% (or more) of the training data, whereas existing methods already struggle with forgetting 10% of training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that offline methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment do not require a direct reward model, they remain susceptible to overoptimization. This issue arises when the trained model deviates excessively from the reference policy, leading to a decrease in sample quality. We propose a new paradigm of offline alignment methods, called Trust Region (including variants TR-DPO, TR-IPO, TR-KTO), which dynamically updates the reference policy throughout the training process. Our results show that TR alignment methods effectively mitigate overoptimization, enabling models to maintain strong performance even when substantially deviating from the initial reference policy. We demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches not only through toy examples that exhibit reduced overoptimization, but also through direct, side-by-side comparisons in specific tasks such as helpful and harmless dialogue, as well as summarization, where they surpass conventional methods. Additionally, we report significant improvements in general-purpose assistant setups with the Llama3 model on the AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of Trust Region methods over classical approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Bini, Karsten Roth, Zeynep Akata, Anna Khoreva</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) has become ubiquitous to adapt foundation models to downstream task requirements while retaining their generalization ability. However, the amount of additionally introduced parameters and compute for successful adaptation and hyperparameter searches can explode quickly, especially when deployed at scale to serve numerous individual requests. To ensure effective, parameter-efficient, and hyperparameter-robust adaptation, we propose the ETHER transformation family, which performs Efficient fineTuning via HypErplane Reflections. By design, ETHER transformations require a minimal number of parameters, are less likely to deteriorate model performance, and exhibit robustness to hyperparameter and learning rate choices. In particular, we introduce ETHER and its relaxation ETHER+, which match or outperform existing PEFT methods with significantly fewer parameters ($\sim$$10$-$100$ times lower than LoRA or OFT) across multiple image synthesis and natural language tasks without exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we investigate the recent emphasis on Hyperspherical Energy retention for adaptation and raise questions on its practical utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Hawkins, David Tivey</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying critical research within the growing body of academic work is an intrinsic aspect of conducting quality research. Systematic review processes used in evidence-based medicine formalise this as a procedure that must be followed in a research program. However, it comes with an increasing burden in terms of the time required to identify the important articles of research for a given topic. In this work, we develop a method for building a general-purpose filtering system that matches a research question, posed as a natural language description of the required content, against a candidate set of articles obtained via the application of broad search terms. Our results demonstrate that transformer models, pre-trained on biomedical literature, and then fine tuned for the specific task, offer a promising solution to this problem. The model can remove large volumes of irrelevant articles for most research questions. Furthermore, analysis of the specific research questions in our training data suggest natural avenues for further improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yapei Chang, Kalpesh Krishna, Amir Houmansadr, John Wieting, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The most effective techniques to detect LLM-generated text rely on inserting a detectable signature -- or watermark -- during the model's decoding process. Most existing watermarking methods require access to the underlying LLM's logits, which LLM API providers are loath to share due to fears of model distillation. As such, these watermarks must be implemented independently by each LLM provider. In this paper, we develop PostMark, a modular post-hoc watermarking procedure in which an input-dependent set of words (determined via a semantic embedding) is inserted into the text after the decoding process has completed. Critically, PostMark does not require logit access, which means it can be implemented by a third party. We also show that PostMark is more robust to paraphrasing attacks than existing watermarking methods: our experiments cover eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets. Finally, we evaluate the impact of PostMark on text quality using both automated and human assessments, highlighting the trade-off between quality and robustness to paraphrasing. We release our code, outputs, and annotations at https://github.com/lilakk/PostMark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vyas Raina, Mark Gales</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Kaushal, Tejas Vaidhya, Arnab Kumar Mondal, Tejas Pandey, Aaryan Bhagat, Irina Rish</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in GPU computational power has outpaced memory capacity and bandwidth growth, creating bottlenecks in Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the pretraining of low-bitwidth models specifically Ternary Language Models (TriLMs) as an alternative to traditional floating-point models (FloatLMs) and their post-training quantized versions (QuantLMs). We present Spectra LLM suite, the first open suite of LLMs spanning multiple bit-widths, including FloatLMs, QuantLMs, and TriLMs, ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TriLMs offer superior scaling behavior in terms of model size (in bits). Surprisingly, at scales exceeding one billion parameters, TriLMs consistently outperform their QuantLM and FloatLM counterparts for a given bit size across various benchmarks. Notably, the 3.9B parameter TriLM matches the performance of the FloatLM 3.9B across all benchmarks, despite having fewer bits than FloatLM 830M. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the feasibility and scalability of low-bitwidth language models, paving the way for the development of more efficient LLMs.
  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kento Nozawa, Takashi Masuko, Toru Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a large language model (LLM) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can be contextualized by providing keywords as prior information in text prompts. We adopt decoder-only architecture and use our in-house LLM, PLaMo-100B, pre-trained from scratch using datasets dominated by Japanese and English texts as the decoder. We adopt a pre-trained Whisper encoder as an audio encoder, and the audio embeddings from the audio encoder are projected to the text embedding space by an adapter layer and concatenated with text embeddings converted from text prompts to form inputs to the decoder. By providing keywords as prior information in the text prompts, we can contextualize our LLM-based ASR system without modifying the model architecture to transcribe ambiguous words in the input audio accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that providing keywords to the decoder can significantly improve the recognition performance of rare and ambiguous words.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the strong representational power of large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to provide semantic and phonetic refinements to address ASR errors. This work explores how LLM-based GER can enhance and expand the capabilities of Japanese language processing, presenting the first GER benchmark for Japanese ASR with 0.9-2.6k text utterances. We also introduce a new multi-pass augmented generative error correction (MPA GER) by integrating multiple system hypotheses on the input side with corrections from multiple LLMs on the output side and then merging them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the use of LLMs for Japanese GER, which involves second-pass language modeling on the output transcriptions generated by the ASR system (e.g., N-best hypotheses). Our experiments demonstrated performance improvement in the proposed methods of ASR quality and generalization both in SPREDS-U1-ja and CSJ data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Koleilat, Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images is essential for modern clinical diagnosis, disease research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezhou Wang, Yaxin Du, Zhuzhong Qian, Siheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Domain-specific Instruction Tuning (FedDIT) utilizes limited cross-client private data together with server-side public data for instruction augmentation, ultimately boosting model performance within specific domains. To date, the factors affecting FedDIT remain unclear, and existing instruction augmentation methods primarily focus on the centralized setting without considering distributed environments. Our experiments reveal that the cross-client domain coverage, rather than data heterogeneity, drives model performance in FedDIT. In response, we propose FedDCA, which optimizes domain coverage through greedy client center selection and retrieval-based augmentation. For client-side computational efficiency and system scalability, FedDCA$^*$, the variant of FedDCA, utilizes heterogeneous encoders with server-side feature alignment. Extensive experiments across four distinct domains (code, medical, financial, and mathematical) substantiate the effectiveness of both methods. Additionally, we investigate privacy preservation against memory extraction attacks utilizing various amounts of public data. Results show that there is no significant correlation between the volume of public data and the privacy-preserving capability. However, as the fine-tuning rounds increase, the risk of privacy leakage reduces or converges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tinghui Zhu, Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Zhengzhong Tu, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for capturing and reasoning over multimodal inputs. However, these models are prone to parametric knowledge conflicts, which arise from inconsistencies of represented knowledge between their vision and language components. In this paper, we formally define the problem of $\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a systematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a pipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing a persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless of the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with the inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the conflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a novel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits inferred from the less confident modality components based on answer confidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two prompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve promising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets. Specifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding improves an average accuracy of 2.24%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Rui Meng, Xinyi Yang, Semih Yavuz, Yingbo Zhou, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite their importance. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on Phi-3.5-V and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB.</p>

<p>Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimization (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we introduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the process. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning abilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO LLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised labels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmark among models of similar size. Upon acceptance, we will release the code, model checkpoints, and training and test data. Demos are available at \href{https://video-salmonn-2.github.io}{https://video-salmonn-2.github.io}.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Pixtral-12B, a 12--billion-parameter multimodal language model. Pixtral-12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \& Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral-12B is released under Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific data to boost downstream performance is a crucial step for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). However, previous studies have demonstrated that fine-tuning the models on several adversarial samples or even benign data can greatly comprise the model's pre-equipped alignment and safety capabilities. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel framework to enhance safety in LLM fine-tuning. SEAL learns a data ranker based on the bilevel optimization to up rank the safe and high-quality fine-tuning data and down rank the unsafe or low-quality ones. Models trained with SEAL demonstrate superior quality over multiple baselines, with 8.5% and 9.7% win rate increase compared to random selection respectively on Llama-3-8b-Instruct and Merlinite-7b models.
