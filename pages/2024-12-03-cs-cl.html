<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Amballa, Durga Sandeep Saluru, Gayathri Akkinapalli, Abhishek Sureddy, Akshay Kumar Sureddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and text generation. However, these models can inadvertently generate unsafe or biased responses when prompted with problematic inputs, raising significant ethical and practical concerns for real-world deployment. This research addresses the critical challenge of developing language models that generate both helpful and harmless content, navigating the delicate balance between model performance and safety. We demonstrate that incorporating safety-related instructions during the instruction-tuning of pre-trained models significantly reduces toxic responses to unsafe prompts without compromising performance on helpfulness datasets. We found Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to be particularly effective, outperforming both SIT and RAFT by leveraging both chosen and rejected responses for learning. Our approach increased safe responses from 40$\%$ to over 90$\%$ across various harmfulness benchmarks. In addition, we discuss a rigorous evaluation framework encompassing specialized metrics and diverse datasets for safety and helpfulness tasks ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model's capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00098">Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Scientific Text Classification: A Comparative Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam, G\'abor Kert\'esz</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of online textual content across diverse domains has necessitated advanced methods for automated text classification. Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have shown significant success in this area, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, general-purpose LLMs often struggle with domain-specific content, such as scientific texts, due to unique challenges like specialized vocabulary and imbalanced data. In this study, we fine-tune four state-of-the-art LLMs BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT on three datasets derived from the WoS-46985 dataset to evaluate their performance in scientific text classification. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific models, particularly SciBERT, consistently outperform general-purpose models in both abstract-based and keyword-based classification tasks. Additionally, we compare our achieved results with those reported in the literature for deep learning models, further highlighting the advantages of LLMs, especially when utilized in specific domains. The findings emphasize the importance of domain-specific adaptations for LLMs to enhance their effectiveness in specialized text classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Batuhan Sariturk, Rabia Bayraktar, Merve Elmas Erdem</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of online education platforms, there is a growing abundance of educational content across various domain. It can be difficult to navigate the numerous available resources to find the most suitable training, especially in domains that include many interconnected areas, such as ICT. In this study, we propose a domain-specific chatbot application that requires limited resources, utilizing versions of the Phi language model to help learners with educational content. In the proposed method, Phi-2 and Phi-3 models were fine-tuned using QLoRA. The data required for fine-tuning was obtained from the Huawei Talent Platform, where courses are available at different levels of expertise in the field of computer science. RAG system was used to support the model, which was fine-tuned by 500 Q&A pairs. Additionally, a total of 420 Q&A pairs of content were extracted from different formats such as JSON, PPT, and DOC to create a vector database to be used in the RAG system. By using the fine-tuned model and RAG approach together, chatbots with different competencies were obtained. The questions and answers asked to the generated chatbots were saved separately and evaluated using ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and BLEU metrics. The precision value of the Phi-2 model supported by RAG was 0.84 and the F1 score was 0.82. In addition to a total of 13 different evaluation metrics in 4 different categories, the answers of each model were compared with the created content and the most appropriate method was selected for real-life applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00166">To Ensemble or Not: Assessing Majority Voting Strategies for Phishing Detection with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fouad Trad, Ali Chehab</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly relies on the quality of the prompts they receive. However, even when processing identical prompts, LLMs can yield varying outcomes due to differences in their training processes. To leverage the collective intelligence of multiple LLMs and enhance their performance, this study investigates three majority voting strategies for text classification, focusing on phishing URL detection. The strategies are: (1) a prompt-based ensemble, which utilizes majority voting across the responses generated by a single LLM to various prompts; (2) a model-based ensemble, which entails aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to a single prompt; and (3) a hybrid ensemble, which combines the two methods by sending different prompts to multiple LLMs and then aggregating their responses. Our analysis shows that ensemble strategies are most suited in cases where individual components exhibit equivalent performance levels. However, when there is a significant discrepancy in individual performance, the effectiveness of the ensemble method may not exceed that of the highest-performing single LLM or prompt. In such instances, opting for ensemble techniques is not recommended.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmeng Hou, Lingyue Fu, Chenhao Meng, Hai Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) and Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) have gained significant attention in natural language processing. However, most existing methods are a pipelined framework, which extracts aspects/opinions and identifies their relations separately, leading to a drawback of error propagation and high time complexity. Towards this problem, we propose a transition-based pipeline to mitigate token-level bias and capture position-aware aspect-opinion relations. With the use of a fused dataset and contrastive learning optimization, our model learns robust action patterns and can optimize separate subtasks jointly, often with linear-time complexity. The results show that our model achieves the best performance on both the ASTE and AOPE tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by at least 6.98\% in the F1 measure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivory Yang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: The preservation and revitalization of endangered and extinct languages is a meaningful endeavor, conserving cultural heritage while enriching fields like linguistics and anthropology. However, these languages are typically low-resource, making their reconstruction labor-intensive and costly. This challenge is exemplified by N\"ushu, a rare script historically used by Yao women in China for self-expression within a patriarchal society. To address this challenge, we introduce N\"ushuRescue, an AI-driven framework designed to train large language models (LLMs) on endangered languages with minimal data. N\"ushuRescue automates evaluation and expands target corpora to accelerate linguistic revitalization. As a foundational component, we developed NCGold, a 500-sentence N\"ushu-Chinese parallel corpus, the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Leveraging GPT-4-Turbo, with no prior exposure to N\"ushu and only 35 short examples from NCGold, N\"ushuRescue achieved 48.69\% translation accuracy on 50 withheld sentences and generated NCSilver, a set of 98 newly translated modern Chinese sentences of varying lengths. A sample of both NCGold and NCSilver is included in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we developed FastText-based and Seq2Seq models to further support research on N\"ushu. N\"ushuRescue provides a versatile and scalable tool for the revitalization of endangered languages, minimizing the need for extensive human input.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00230">Clinical Document Corpora and Assorted Domain Proxies: A Survey of Diversity in Corpus Design, with Focus on German Text Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Udo Hahn</p>
<p>Abstract: We survey clinical document corpora, with focus on German textual data. Due to rigid data privacy legislation in Germany these resources, with only few exceptions, are stored in safe clinical data spaces and locked against clinic-external researchers. This situation stands in stark contrast with established workflows in the field of natural language processing where easy accessibility and reuse of data collections are common practice. Hence, alternative corpus designs have been examined to escape from this data poverty. Besides machine translation of English clinical datasets and the generation of synthetic corpora with fictitious clinical contents, several other types of domain proxies have come up as substitutes for authentic clinical documents. Common instances of close proxies are medical journal publications, clinical therapy guidelines, drug labels, etc., more distant proxies include online encyclopedic medical articles or medical contents from social media channels. After PRISM-conformant screening of 359 hits from four bibliographic systems, 75 relevant documents were finally selected for this review and 59 distinct corpora were determined. We identified 24 real clinical corpora (from 40 publications) out of which only 5 are publicly distributable. 2 translations of real corpora and 3 synthetic ones complement the set of clinical corpora. 14 corpora were categorized as close domain proxies, 16 as distant ones. There is a clear divide between the large number of non-accessible authentic clinical German-language corpora and their publicly accessible substitutes: translated or synthetic, close or more distant proxies. So on first sight, the data bottleneck seems broken. Intuitively yet, differences in genre-specific writing style, wording and medical domain expertise in this typological space are also obvious. This raises the question how valid alternative corpus designs really are.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00323">Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models: A Survey and Mitigation Experiments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasuaki Sumita, Koh Takeuchi, Hisashi Kashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora written by humans and demonstrate high performance on various tasks. However, as humans are susceptible to cognitive biases, which can result in irrational judgments, LLMs can also be influenced by these biases, leading to irrational decision-making. For example, changing the order of options in multiple-choice questions affects the performance of LLMs due to order bias. In our research, we first conducted an extensive survey of existing studies examining LLMs' cognitive biases and their mitigation. The mitigation techniques in LLMs have the disadvantage that they are limited in the type of biases they can apply or require lengthy inputs or outputs. We then examined the effectiveness of two mitigation methods for humans, SoPro and AwaRe, when applied to LLMs, inspired by studies in crowdsourcing. To test the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted experiments on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to evaluate the influence of six biases on the outputs before and after applying these methods. The results demonstrate that while SoPro has little effect, AwaRe enables LLMs to mitigate the effect of these biases and make more rational responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanu Kumar, Saish Mendke, Karody Lubna Abdul Rahman, Santosh Kurasa, Parag Agrawal, Sandipan Dandapat</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the capability of large language models (LLMs) by structuring their reasoning processes. However, existing methods face critical limitations: handcrafted demonstrations require extensive human expertise, while trigger phrases are prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose the Zero-shot Uncertainty-based Selection (ZEUS) method, a novel approach that improves CoT prompting by utilizing uncertainty estimates to select effective demonstrations without needing access to model parameters. Unlike traditional methods, ZEUS offers high sensitivity in distinguishing between helpful and ineffective questions, ensuring more precise and reliable selection. Our extensive evaluation shows that ZEUS consistently outperforms existing CoT strategies across four challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Kowsher, Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, Chun-Nam Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of self-attention lies in its ability to capture long-range dependencies and enhance context understanding, but it is limited by its computational complexity and challenges in handling sequential data with inherent directionality. This work introduces a shared weight self-attention-based BERT model that only learns one weight matrix for (Key, Value, and Query) representations instead of three individual matrices for each of them. Our shared weight attention reduces the training parameter size by more than half and training time by around one-tenth. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher prediction accuracy on small tasks of GLUE over the BERT baseline and in particular a generalization power on noisy and out-of-domain data. Experimental results indicate that our shared self-attention method achieves a parameter size reduction of 66.53% in the attention block. In the GLUE dataset, the shared weight self-attention-based BERT model demonstrates accuracy improvements of 0.38%, 5.81%, and 1.06% over the standard, symmetric, and pairwise attention-based BERT models, respectively. The model and source code are available at Anonymous.</p>

<p>Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is a task that typically requires large annotated datasets, which limits its applicability across domains with varying entity definitions. This paper addresses few-shot NER, aiming to transfer knowledge to new domains with minimal supervision. Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on limited annotated data, we propose a weakly supervised algorithm that combines small labeled datasets with large amounts of unlabeled data. Our method extends the k-means algorithm with label supervision, cluster size constraints and domain-specific discriminative subspace selection. This unified framework achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot NER on several English datasets.</p>

Fifteen non-native speakers of English were recruited as participants of the study. A center-embedding English sentence was presented to both the study participants and ChatGPT. The study findings unveil that human brain is still far ahead of Large Language Models, specifically ChatGPT, even in the case of non-native speakers of an L2, here English. The study concludes that human brain's ability to process and interpret natural language data is unique and that ChatGPT still lags behind this human unique ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang Duc Nguyen, Tung Nguyen, Duc Anh Nguyen, Linh Ngo Van, Sang Dinh, Thien Huu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncovering hidden topics from short texts is challenging for traditional and neural models due to data sparsity, which limits word co-occurrence patterns, and label sparsity, stemming from incomplete reconstruction targets. Although data aggregation offers a potential solution, existing neural topic models often overlook it due to time complexity, poor aggregation quality, and difficulty in inferring topic proportions for individual documents. In this paper, we propose a novel model, GloCOM (Global Clustering COntexts for Topic Models), which addresses these challenges by constructing aggregated global clustering contexts for short documents, leveraging text embeddings from pre-trained language models. GloCOM can infer both global topic distributions for clustering contexts and local distributions for individual short texts. Additionally, the model incorporates these global contexts to augment the reconstruction loss, effectively handling the label sparsity issue. Extensive experiments on short text datasets show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both topic quality and document representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have started a new era of superior information retrieval and content generation, with embedding models playing an important role in optimizing data representation efficiency and performance. While benchmarks like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) have standardized the evaluation of general domain embedding models, a gap remains in specialized fields such as chemistry, which require tailored approaches due to domain-specific challenges. This paper introduces a novel benchmark, the Chemical Text Embedding Benchmark (ChemTEB), designed specifically for the chemical sciences. ChemTEB addresses the unique linguistic and semantic complexities of chemical literature and data, offering a comprehensive suite of tasks on chemical domain data. Through the evaluation of 34 open-source and proprietary models using this benchmark, we illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies in processing and understanding chemical information. Our work aims to equip the research community with a standardized, domain-specific evaluation framework, promoting the development of more precise and efficient NLP models for chemistry-related applications. Furthermore, it provides insights into the performance of generic models in a domain-specific context. ChemTEB comes with open-source code and data, contributing further to its accessibility and utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: The TextClass Benchmark project is an ongoing, continuous benchmarking process that aims to provide a comprehensive, fair, and dynamic evaluation of LLMs and transformers for text classification tasks. This evaluation spans various domains and languages in social sciences disciplines engaged in NLP and text-as-data approach. The leaderboards present performance metrics and relative ranking using a tailored Elo rating system. With each leaderboard cycle, novel models are added, fixed test sets can be replaced for unseen, equivalent data to test generalisation power, ratings are updated, and a Meta-Elo leaderboard combines and weights domain-specific leaderboards. This article presents the rationale and motivation behind the project, explains the Elo rating system in detail, and estimates Meta-Elo across different classification tasks in social science disciplines. We also present a snapshot of the first cycle of classification tasks on incivility data in Chinese, English, German and Russian. This ongoing benchmarking process includes not only additional languages such as Arabic, Hindi, and Spanish but also a classification of policy agenda topics, misinformation, among others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as general evaluators along with the evident benefits of speed and cost. While their correlation against human annotators has been widely studied, consistency as evaluators is still understudied, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM evaluators. In this paper, we conduct extensive studies on the two aspects of consistency in LLM evaluations, Self-Consistency (SC) and Inter-scale Consistency (IC), on different scoring scales and criterion granularity with open-source and proprietary models. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that strong proprietary models are not necessarily consistent evaluators, highlighting the importance of considering consistency in assessing the capability of LLM evaluators.</p>

We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs with three prevalent learning frameworks across six diverse healthcare tasks and find significant challenges in applying LLMs to real-world healthcare tasks and persistent fairness issues across demographic groups. We also find that explicitly providing demographic information yields mixed results, while LLM's ability to infer such details raises concerns about biased health predictions. Utilizing LLMs as autonomous agents with access to up-to-date guidelines does not guarantee performance improvement. We believe these findings reveal the critical limitations of LLMs in healthcare fairness and the urgent need for specialized research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> {\L}ukasz Grzybowski, Jakub Pokrywka, Micha{\l} Ciesi\'o{\l}ka, Jeremi I. Kaczmarek, Marek Kubis</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling specialized tasks, including medical problem-solving. However, most studies predominantly focus on English-language contexts. This study introduces a novel benchmark dataset based on Polish medical licensing and specialization exams (LEK, LDEK, PES) taken by medical doctor candidates and practicing doctors pursuing specialization. The dataset was web-scraped from publicly available resources provided by the Medical Examination Center and the Chief Medical Chamber. It comprises over 24,000 exam questions, including a subset of parallel Polish-English corpora, where the English portion was professionally translated by the examination center for foreign candidates. By creating a structured benchmark from these existing exam questions, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including general-purpose, domain-specific, and Polish-specific models, and compare their performance against human medical students. Our analysis reveals that while models like GPT-4o achieve near-human performance, significant challenges persist in cross-lingual translation and domain-specific understanding. These findings underscore disparities in model performance across languages and medical specialties, highlighting the limitations and ethical considerations of deploying LLMs in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Abdallah, Jamshid Mozafari, Bhawna Piryani, Mohammed M. Abdelgwad, Adam Jatowt</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents DynRank, a novel framework for enhancing passage retrieval in open-domain question-answering systems through dynamic zero-shot question classification. Traditional approaches rely on static prompts and pre-defined templates, which may limit model adaptability across different questions and contexts. In contrast, DynRank introduces a dynamic prompting mechanism, leveraging a pre-trained question classification model that categorizes questions into fine-grained types. Based on these classifications, contextually relevant prompts are generated, enabling more effective passage retrieval. We integrate DynRank into existing retrieval frameworks and conduct extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zefang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Incident response (IR) is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, requiring rapid decision-making and coordinated efforts to address cyberattacks effectively. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents offers a novel approach to enhancing collaboration and efficiency in IR scenarios. This paper explores the application of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration using the Backdoors & Breaches framework, a tabletop game designed for cybersecurity training. We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making, improve adaptability, and streamline IR processes, paving the way for more effective and coordinated responses to cyber threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Huang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Agent could be endowed with different mechanisms for autonomous task accomplishment. Current agents typically rely on fixed mechanisms or a set of mechanisms activated in a predefined order, limiting their adaptation to varied potential task solution structures. To this end, this paper proposes \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}echanism \textbf{A}ctivation Learning with Self-Exploration (\textbf{ALAMA}), which focuses on optimizing mechanism activation adaptability without reliance on expert models. Initially, it builds a harmonized agent framework (\textbf{UniAct}) to \textbf{Uni}fy different mechanisms via \textbf{Act}ions. Then it leverages a training-efficient optimization method based on self-exploration to enable the UniAct to adaptively activate the appropriate mechanisms according to the potential characteristics of the task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in downstream agent tasks, affirming the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating more dynamic and context-sensitive mechanism activation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diandian Guo, Cong Cao, Fangfang Yuan, Yanbing Liu, Guangjie Zeng, Xiaoyan Yu, Hao Peng, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) is essential for various downstream tasks. Existing MSD methods tend to rely on spurious correlations. These methods often mistakenly prioritize non-essential features yet still make correct predictions, demonstrating poor generalizability beyond training environments. Regarding this phenomenon, this paper undertakes several initiatives. Firstly, we identify two primary causes that lead to the reliance of spurious correlations. Secondly, we address these challenges by proposing a novel method that integrate Multimodal Incongruities via Contrastive Learning (MICL) for multimodal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we first leverage incongruity to drive multi-view learning from three views: token-patch, entity-object, and sentiment. Then, we introduce extensive data augmentation to mitigate the biased learning of the textual modality. Additionally, we construct a test set, SPMSD, which consists potential spurious correlations to evaluate the the model's generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MICL on benchmark datasets, along with the analyses showcasing MICL's advancement in mitigating the effect of spurious correlation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Dong, Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, generative pre-training based models have demonstrated remarkable results on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task. However, previous works overemphasize crafting various templates to paraphrase training targets for enhanced decoding, ignoring the internal optimizations on generative models. Despite notable results achieved by these target-oriented optimization methods, they struggle with the complicated long texts since the implicit long-distance relation, e.g., aspect-opinion relation, is difficult to extract under the position embedding mechanism in generative models. Thus, in this paper, we first clarify the causes of the problem and introduce two sequence optimization strategies: the rule-based static optimization and the score-based dynamic optimization. The rule-based approach relies on handcraft priority of dependency relation to reorder the context, while the score-based algorithm dynamically regulates the contextual sequence by calculating word position scores using neural network. Based on the dynamic optimization structure, we further propose a unified Prompt-based Generative Sequence Optimization network (named PGSO), which jointly optimizes the training target as well as the generative model. Specifically, PGSO contains two components, namely, prompt construction and sequence regulator. The former constructs a task-specific prompt based on unsupervised training objects to fully utilize the pre-trained model. The latter jointly leverages semantic, syntactic and original-sequence information to dynamically regulate contextual sequence. Our experiments conducted on four ABSA tasks across multiple benchmarks indicate that PGSO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 3.52% in F1 score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aihua Pei, Zehua Yang, Shunan Zhu, Ruoxi Cheng, Ju Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) often rely on standardized benchmarks, which can escalate costs and limit evaluations across varied domains. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to autonomously evaluate the robustness of LLMs by incorporating refined adversarial prompts and domain-constrained knowledge guidelines in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method systematically generates descriptive sentences from domain-constrained knowledge graph triplets to formulate adversarial prompts, enhancing the relevance and challenge of the evaluation. These prompts, generated by the LLM itself and tailored to evaluate its own robustness, undergo a rigorous filtering and refinement process, ensuring that only those with high textual fluency and semantic fidelity are used. This self-evaluation mechanism allows the LLM to evaluate its robustness without the need for external benchmarks. We assess the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing on both proprietary models like ChatGPT and open-source models such as Llama-3.1, Phi-3, and Mistral. Results confirm that our approach not only reduces dependency on conventional data but also provides a targeted and efficient means of evaluating LLM robustness in constrained domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thilini Wijesiriwardene, Ruwan Wickramarachchi, Sreeram Vennam, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Amit Sheth</p>
<p>Abstract: Making analogies is fundamental to cognition. Proportional analogies, which consist of four terms, are often used to assess linguistic and cognitive abilities. For instance, completing analogies like "Oxygen is to Gas as <blank> is to <blank>" requires identifying the semantic relationship (e.g., "type of") between the first pair of terms ("Oxygen" and "Gas") and finding a second pair that shares the same relationship (e.g., "Aluminum" and "Metal"). In this work, we introduce a 15K Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset for proportional analogy completion and evaluate the performance of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in various knowledge-enhanced prompt settings. Specifically, we augment prompts with three types of knowledge: exemplar, structured, and targeted. Our results show that despite extensive training data, solving proportional analogies remains challenging for current LLMs, with the best model achieving an accuracy of 55%. Notably, we find that providing targeted knowledge can better assist models in completing proportional analogies compared to providing exemplars or collections of structured knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: The semi-supervised learning (SSL) strategy in lightweight models requires reducing annotated samples and facilitating cost-effective inference. However, the constraint on model parameters, imposed by the scarcity of training labels, limits the SSL performance. In this paper, we introduce PS-NET, a novel framework tailored for semi-supervised text mining with lightweight models. PS-NET incorporates online distillation to train lightweight student models by imitating the Teacher model. It also integrates an ensemble of student peers that collaboratively instruct each other. Additionally, PS-NET implements a constant adversarial perturbation schema to further self-augmentation by progressive generalizing. Our PS-NET, equipped with a 2-layer distilled BERT, exhibits notable performance enhancements over SOTA lightweight SSL frameworks of FLiText and DisCo in SSL text classification with extremely rare labelled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Kamoi, Yusen Zhang, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ranran Haoran Zhang, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Errors in understanding visual information in images (i.e., visual perception errors) remain a major source of mistakes in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). While further analysis is essential, there is a deficiency in datasets for evaluating the visual perception of LVLMs. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a new dataset designed to directly evaluate the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs on questions about geometric and numerical information in scientific figures. Our dataset enables us to analyze the visual perception of LVLMs for fine-grained visual information, independent of other capabilities such as reasoning. The evaluation set of VisOnlyQA includes 1,200 multiple-choice questions in 12 tasks on four categories of figures. We also provide synthetic training data consisting of 70k instances. Our experiments on VisOnlyQA highlight the following findings: (i) 20 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, work poorly on the visual perception tasks in VisOnlyQA, while human performance is nearly perfect. (ii) Fine-tuning on synthetic training data demonstrates the potential for enhancing the visual perception of LVLMs, but observed improvements are limited to certain tasks and specific models. (iii) Stronger language models improve the visual perception of LVLMs. In summary, our experiments suggest that both training data and model architectures should be improved to enhance the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks and factual accuracy often focus on high-resource languages primarily because datasets for low-resource languages (LRLs) are scarce. In this paper, we present Uhura -- a new benchmark that focuses on two tasks in six typologically-diverse African languages, created via human translation of existing English benchmarks. The first dataset, Uhura-ARC-Easy, is composed of multiple-choice science questions. The second, Uhura-TruthfulQA, is a safety benchmark testing the truthfulness of models on topics including health, law, finance, and politics. We highlight the challenges creating benchmarks with highly technical content for LRLs and outline mitigation strategies. Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between proprietary models such as GPT-4o and o1-preview, and Claude models, and open-source models like Meta's LLaMA and Google's Gemma. Additionally, all models perform better in English than in African languages. These results indicate that LMs struggle with answering scientific questions and are more prone to generating false claims in low-resource African languages. Our findings underscore the necessity for continuous improvement of multilingual LM capabilities in LRL settings to ensure safe and reliable use in real-world contexts. We open-source the Uhura Benchmark and Uhura Platform to foster further research and development in NLP for LRLs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Marashian, Enora Rice, Luke Gessler, Alexis Palmer, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: Many of the world's languages have insufficient data to train high-performing general neural machine translation (NMT) models, let alone domain-specific models, and often the only available parallel data are small amounts of religious texts. Hence, domain adaptation (DA) is a crucial issue faced by contemporary NMT and has, so far, been underexplored for low-resource languages. In this paper, we evaluate a set of methods from both low-resource NMT and DA in a realistic setting, in which we aim to translate between a high-resource and a low-resource language with access to only: a) parallel Bible data, b) a bilingual dictionary, and c) a monolingual target-domain corpus in the high-resource language. Our results show that the effectiveness of the tested methods varies, with the simplest one, DALI, being most effective. We follow up with a small human evaluation of DALI, which shows that there is still a need for more careful investigation of how to accomplish DA for low-resource NMT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Suresh, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Yifei Xu, Zach Nussbaum, Andriy Mulyar, Brandon Duderstadt, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective code retrieval plays a crucial role in advancing code generation, bug fixing, and software maintenance, particularly as software systems increase in complexity. While current code embedding models have demonstrated promise in retrieving code snippets for small-scale, well-defined tasks, they often underperform in more demanding real-world applications such as bug localization within GitHub repositories. We hypothesize that a key issue is their reliance on noisy and inconsistent datasets for training, which impedes their ability to generalize to more complex retrieval scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce CoRNStack, a large-scale, high-quality contrastive training dataset for code that spans multiple programming languages. This dataset is curated using consistency filtering to eliminate noisy positives and is further enriched with mined hard negatives, thereby facilitating more effective learning. We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using CoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code reranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking. Our finetuned code reranking model significantly improves the ranking quality over the retrieved results. Finally, by employing our code retriever and reranker together, we demonstrate significant improvements in function localization for GitHub issues, an important component of real-world software development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Zhao, Xujiang Zhao, Yanchi Liu, Wei Cheng, Yiyou Sun, Mika Oishi, Takao Osaki, Katsushi Matsuda, Huaxiu Yao, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into multistep agent systems enable complex decision-making processes across various applications. However, their outputs often lack reliability, making uncertainty estimation crucial. Existing uncertainty estimation methods primarily focus on final-step outputs, which fail to account for cumulative uncertainty over the multistep decision-making process and the dynamic interactions between agents and their environments. To address these limitations, we propose SAUP (Situation Awareness Uncertainty Propagation), a novel framework that propagates uncertainty through each step of an LLM-based agent's reasoning process. SAUP incorporates situational awareness by assigning situational weights to each step's uncertainty during the propagation. Our method, compatible with various one-step uncertainty estimation techniques, provides a comprehensive and accurate uncertainty measure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAUP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 20% improvement in AUROC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Izhar Ali, Million Haileyesus, Serhiy Hnatyshyn, Jan-Lucas Ott, Vasil Hnatyshin</p>
<p>Abstract: This project addresses challenges posed by the widespread use of abbreviations and acronyms in digital texts. We propose a novel method that combines document preprocessing, regular expressions, and a large language model to identify abbreviations and map them to their corresponding expansions. The regular expressions alone are often insufficient to extract expansions, at which point our approach leverages GPT-4 to analyze the text surrounding the acronyms. By limiting the analysis to only a small portion of the surrounding text, we mitigate the risk of obtaining incorrect or multiple expansions for an acronym. There are several known challenges in processing text with acronyms, including polysemous acronyms, non-local and ambiguous acronyms. Our approach enhances the precision and efficiency of NLP techniques by addressing these issues with automated acronym identification and disambiguation. This study highlights the challenges of working with PDF files and the importance of document preprocessing. Furthermore, the results of this work show that neither regular expressions nor GPT-4 alone can perform well. Regular expressions are suitable for identifying acronyms but have limitations in finding their expansions within the paper due to a variety of formats used for expressing acronym-expansion pairs and the tendency of authors to omit expansions within the text. GPT-4, on the other hand, is an excellent tool for obtaining expansions but struggles with correctly identifying all relevant acronyms. Additionally, GPT-4 poses challenges due to its probabilistic nature, which may lead to slightly different results for the same input. Our algorithm employs preprocessing to eliminate irrelevant information from the text, regular expressions for identifying acronyms, and a large language model to help find acronym expansions to provide the most accurate and consistent results.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores null elements in English, Chinese, and Korean Penn treebanks. Null elements contain important syntactic and semantic information, yet they have typically been treated as entities to be removed during language processing tasks, particularly in constituency parsing. Thus, we work towards the removal and, in particular, the restoration of null elements in parse trees. We focus on expanding a rule-based approach utilizing linguistic context information to Chinese, as rule based approaches have historically only been applied to English. We also worked to conduct neural experiments with a language agnostic sequence-to-sequence model to recover null elements for English (PTB), Chinese (CTB) and Korean (KTB). To the best of the authors' knowledge, null elements in three different languages have been explored and compared for the first time. In expanding a rule based approach to Chinese, we achieved an overall F1 score of 80.00, which is comparable to past results in the CTB. In our neural experiments we achieved F1 scores up to 90.94, 85.38 and 88.79 for English, Chinese, and Korean respectively with functional labels.</p>

Specifically, we inspect when they internally determine their answers, particularly before or after CoT begins, to determine whether models follow a post-hoc "think-to-talk" mode or a step-by-step "talk-to-think" mode of explanation. Through causal probing experiments in controlled arithmetic reasoning tasks, we found systematic internal reasoning patterns across models; for example, simple subproblems are solved before CoT begins, and more complicated multi-hop calculations are performed during CoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Chang Chen, Po-Chun Hsu, Chan-Jan Hsu, Da-shan Shiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous agents, particularly in zero-shot tool usage, also known as function calling. This research delves into enhancing the function-calling capabilities of LLMs by exploring different approaches, including prompt formats for integrating function descriptions, blending function-calling and instruction-following data, introducing a novel Decision Token for conditional prompts, leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, and overcoming multilingual challenges with a translation pipeline. Our key findings and contributions are as follows: (1) Instruction-following data improves both function-calling accuracy and relevance detection. (2) The use of the newly proposed Decision Token, combined with synthetic non-function-call data, enhances relevance detection. (3) A tailored translation pipeline effectively overcomes multilingual limitations, demonstrating significant improvements in Traditional Chinese. These insights highlight the potential for improved function-calling capabilities and multilingual applications in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Cao, Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel, Takenobu Tokunaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, much work has concerned itself with the enigma of what exactly PLMs (pretrained language models) learn about different aspects of language, and how they learn it. One stream of this type of research investigates the knowledge that PLMs have about semantic relations. However, many aspects of semantic relations were left unexplored. Only one relation was considered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure humans' performance on the same task as that solved by the PLMs. This means that at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy, namely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use six metrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic relation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, asymmetry, prototypicality, and distinguishability and fairly compare humans and models on the same task. Our extensive experiments involve 16 PLMs, eight masked and eight causal language models. Up to now only masked language models had been tested although causal and masked language models treat context differently. Our results reveal a significant knowledge gap between humans and models for almost all semantic relations. Antonymy is the outlier relation where all models perform reasonably well. In general, masked language models perform significantly better than causal language models. Nonetheless, both masked and causal language models are likely to confuse non-antonymy relations with antonymy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Guo, Longxu Dou, Guangtao Zeng, Stanley Kok, Wei Lu, Qian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SailCompass, a reproducible and robust evaluation benchmark for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) on Southeast Asian Languages (SEA). SailCompass encompasses three main SEA languages, eight primary tasks including 14 datasets covering three task types (generation, multiple-choice questions, and classification). To improve the robustness of the evaluation approach, we explore different prompt configurations for multiple-choice questions and leverage calibrations to improve the faithfulness of classification tasks. With SailCompass, we derive the following findings: (1) SEA-specialized LLMs still outperform general LLMs, although the gap has narrowed; (2) A balanced language distribution is important for developing better SEA-specialized LLMs; (3) Advanced prompting techniques (e.g., calibration, perplexity-based ranking) are necessary to better utilize LLMs. All datasets and evaluation scripts are public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianlong Li, Chen Huang, Shuai Li, Yuanxin Xiang, Deng Xiong, Wenqiang Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex Table Question Answering involves providing accurate answers to specific questions based on intricate tables that exhibit complex layouts and flexible header locations. Despite considerable progress having been made in the LLM era, the reasoning processes of existing methods are often implicit, feeding the entire table into prompts, making it difficult to effectively filter out irrelevant information in the table. To this end, we propose GraphOTTER that explicitly establishes the reasoning process to pinpoint the correct answers. In particular, GraphOTTER leverages a graph-based representation, transforming the complex table into an undirected graph. It then conducts step-by-step reasoning on the graph, with each step guided by a set of pre-defined intermediate reasoning actions. As such, it constructs a clear reasoning path and effectively identifies the answer to a given question. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOTTER. Further analysis indicates that its success may be attributed to the ability to efficiently filter out irrelevant information, thereby focusing the reasoning process on the most pertinent data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yang, Zhenyu Zhang, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: As a fine-grained task, multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) mainly focuses on identifying aspect-level sentiment information in the text-image pair. However, we observe that it is difficult to recognize the sentiment of aspects in low-quality samples, such as those with low-resolution images that tend to contain noise. And in the real world, the quality of data usually varies for different samples, such noise is called data uncertainty. But previous works for the MABSA task treat different quality samples with the same importance and ignored the influence of data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel data uncertainty-aware multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis approach, UA-MABSA, which weighted the loss of different samples by the data quality and difficulty. UA-MABSA adopts a novel quality assessment strategy that takes into account both the image quality and the aspect-based cross-modal relevance, thus enabling the model to pay more attention to high-quality and challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Twitter-2015 dataset. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the quality assessment strategy.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michelle Elizabeth, Morgan Veyret, Miguel Couceiro, Ondrej Dusek, Lina M. Rojas-Barahona</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) gained immense popularity due to their impressive capabilities in unstructured conversations. However, they underperform compared to previous approaches in task-oriented dialogue (TOD), wherein reasoning and accessing external information are crucial. Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing TOD. We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs seem to underperform state-of-the-art approaches in simulation, human evaluation indicates higher user satisfaction rate compared to handcrafted systems despite having a lower success rate.</p>

However, they have yet to effectively leverage the wealth of information contained in economic text, such as causal relationships, in their economic forecasting. Therefore, we design indices of economic fluctuation from economic surveys by using our previously proposed narrative framework. From the evaluation results, it is observed that the proposed indices had a stronger correlation with cumulative lagging diffusion index than other types of diffusion indices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Xing, Muyan Zhong, Zeqiang Lai, Liangchen Li, Jiawen Liu, Yaohui Wang, Jifeng Dai, Wenhai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages. Based on this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (38.61 for English vs. 37.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliot Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language syntax can serve as a major test for how to integrate two infamously distinct frameworks: symbolic representations and connectionist neural networks. Building on a recent neurocomputational architecture for syntax (ROSE), I discuss the prospects of reconciling the neural code for hierarchical 'vertical' syntax with linear and predictive 'horizontal' processes via a hybrid neurosymbolic model. I argue that the former can be accounted for via the higher levels of ROSE in terms of vertical phrase structure representations, while the latter can explain horizontal forms of linguistic information via the tuning of the lower levels to statistical and perceptual inferences. One prediction of this is that artificial language models will contribute to the cognitive neuroscience of horizontal morphosyntax, but much less so to hierarchically compositional structures. I claim that this perspective helps resolve many current tensions in the literature. Options for integrating these two neural codes are discussed, with particular emphasis on how predictive coding mechanisms can serve as interfaces between symbolic oscillatory phase codes and population codes for the statistics of linearized aspects of syntax. Lastly, I provide a neurosymbolic mathematical model for how to inject symbolic representations into a neural regime encoding lexico-semantic statistical features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text Simplification is a task that has been minimally explored for low-resource languages. Consequently, there are only a few manually curated datasets. In this paper, we present a human curated sentence-level text simplification dataset for the Sinhala language. Our evaluation dataset contains 1,000 complex sentences and corresponding 3,000 simplified sentences produced by three different human annotators. We model the text simplification task as a zero-shot and zero resource sequence-to-sequence (seq-seq) task on the multilingual language models mT5 and mBART. We exploit auxiliary data from related seq-seq tasks and explore the possibility of using intermediate task transfer learning (ITTL). Our analysis shows that ITTL outperforms the previously proposed zero-resource methods for text simplification. Our findings also highlight the challenges in evaluating text simplification systems, and support the calls for improved metrics for measuring the quality of automated text simplification systems that would suit low-resource languages as well.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Abramski, Riccardo Improta, Giulio Rossetti, Massimo Stella</p>
<p>Abstract: Free associations have been extensively used in cognitive psychology and linguistics for studying how conceptual knowledge is organized. Recently, the potential of applying a similar approach for investigating the knowledge encoded in LLMs has emerged, specifically as a method for investigating LLM biases. However, the absence of large-scale LLM-generated free association norms that are comparable with human-generated norms is an obstacle to this new research direction. To address this limitation, we create a new dataset of LLM-generated free association norms modeled after the "Small World of Words" (SWOW) human-generated norms consisting of approximately 12,000 cue words. We prompt three LLMs, namely Mistral, Llama3, and Haiku, with the same cues as those in the SWOW norms to generate three novel comparable datasets, the "LLM World of Words" (LWOW). Using both SWOW and LWOW norms, we construct cognitive network models of semantic memory that represent the conceptual knowledge possessed by humans and LLMs. We demonstrate how these datasets can be used for investigating implicit biases in humans and LLMs, such as the harmful gender stereotypes that are prevalent both in society and LLM outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of computer systems necessitates innovative approaches to fault and error management, going beyond traditional manual log analysis. While existing solutions using large language models (LLMs) show promise, they are limited by a gap between natural and domain-specific languages, which restricts their effectiveness in real-world applications. Our approach addresses these limitations by integrating interpretable domain knowledge into open-source LLMs through continual pre-training (CPT), enhancing performance on log tasks while retaining natural language processing capabilities. We created a comprehensive dataset, NLPLog, with over 250,000 question-answer pairs to facilitate this integration. Our model, SuperLog, trained with this dataset, achieves the best performance across four log analysis tasks, surpassing the second-best model by an average of 12.01%. Our contributions include a novel CPT paradigm that significantly improves model performance, the development of SuperLog with state-of-the-art results, and the release of a large-scale dataset to support further research in this domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online abusive content detection, particularly in low-resource settings and within the audio modality, remains underexplored. We investigate the potential of pre-trained audio representations for detecting abusive language in low-resource languages, in this case, in Indian languages using Few Shot Learning (FSL). Leveraging powerful representations from models such as Wav2Vec and Whisper, we explore cross-lingual abuse detection using the ADIMA dataset with FSL. Our approach integrates these representations within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to classify abusive language in 10 languages. We experiment with various shot sizes (50-200) evaluating the impact of limited data on performance. Additionally, a feature visualization study was conducted to better understand model behaviour. This study highlights the generalization ability of pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios and offers valuable insights into detecting abusive language in multilingual contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting euphemisms is essential for content security on various social media platforms, but existing methods designed for detecting euphemisms are ineffective in impromptu euphemisms. In this work, we make a first attempt to an exploration of impromptu euphemism detection and introduce the Impromptu Cybercrime Euphemisms Detection (ICED) dataset. Moreover, we propose a detection framework tailored to this problem, which employs context augmentation modeling and multi-round iterative training. Our detection framework mainly consists of a coarse-grained and a fine-grained classification model. The coarse-grained classification model removes most of the harmless content in the corpus to be detected. The fine-grained model, impromptu euphemisms detector, integrates context augmentation and multi-round iterations training to better predicts the actual meaning of a masked token. In addition, we leverage ChatGPT to evaluate the mode's capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a remarkable 76-fold improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art euphemism detector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhu Liu, Cunliang Kong, Ying Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic map models (SMMs) construct a network-like conceptual space from cross-linguistic instances or forms, based on the connectivity hypothesis. This approach has been widely used to represent similarity and entailment relationships in cross-linguistic concept comparisons. However, most SMMs are manually built by human experts using bottom-up procedures, which are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm that automatically generates conceptual spaces and SMMs in a top-down manner. The algorithm begins by creating a dense graph, which is subsequently pruned into maximum spanning trees, selected according to metrics we propose. These evaluation metrics include both intrinsic and extrinsic measures, considering factors such as network structure and the trade-off between precision and coverage. A case study on cross-linguistic supplementary adverbs demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared to human annotations and other automated methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shwetha Somasundaram, Anirudh Phukan, Apoorv Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce the latency associated with autoretrogressive LLM inference, speculative decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm, where future tokens are drafted and verified in parallel. However, the practical deployment of speculative decoding is hindered by its requirements for additional computational resources and fine-tuning, which limits its out-of-the-box usability. To address these challenges, we present PLD+, a suite of novel algorithms developed to accelerate the inference process of LLMs, particularly for input-guided tasks. These tasks, which include code editing, text editing, summarization, etc., often feature outputs with substantial overlap with their inputs-an attribute PLD+ is designed to exploit. PLD+ also leverages the artifacts (attention and hidden states) generated during inference to accelerate inference speed. We test our approach on five input-guided tasks and through extensive experiments we find that PLD+ outperforms all tuning-free approaches. In the greedy setting, it even outperforms the state-of-the-art tuning-dependent approach EAGLE on four of the tasks. (by a margin of upto 2.31 in terms of avg. speedup). Our approach is tuning free, does not require any additional compute and can easily be used for accelerating inference of any LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqiao Shan, Long Meng, Tong Zheng, Yingfeng Luo, Bei Li, junxin Wang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various downstream tasks. However, they encounter limitations due to slow inference speeds stemming from their extensive parameters. The early exit (EE) is an approach that aims to accelerate auto-regressive decoding. EE generates outputs from intermediate layers instead of using the whole model, which offers a promising solution to this challenge. However, additional output layers and joint optimization used in conventional EE hinder the application of EE in LLMs.
  In this paper, we explore the possibility of LLMs EE without additional output layers and joint optimization. Our findings indicate that EE is a natural capability within transformer-based models. While joint optimization does not give model EE capability, it must be employed to address challenges by improving the accuracy of locating the optimal EE layer through gating functions. Additionally, our study reveals patterns in EE behavior from a sub-word perspective based on the LLaMA model and the potential possibility for EE based on sub-layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Shuai, Yiding Wang, Yimeng Wu, Xin Jiang, Xiaozhe Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advances in recent years, with scaling laws playing a critical role in this rapid progress. In this paper, we empirically investigate how a critical hyper-parameter, i.e., the global batch size, influences the LLM training prdocess. We begin by training language models ranging from 125 million to 2.6 billion parameters, using up to 300 billion high-quality tokens. Through these experiments, we establish a basic scaling law on model size and training data amount. We then examine how varying batch sizes and learning rates affect the convergence and generalization of these models. Our analysis yields batch size scaling laws under two different cases: with a fixed compute budget, and with a fixed amount of training data. Extrapolation experiments on models of increasing sizes validate our predicted laws, which provides guidance for optimizing LLM training strategies under specific resource constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Liu, Wenxuan Wang, Zizhan Ma, Guolin Huang, Yihang SU, Kao-Jung Chang, Wenting Chen, Haoliang Li, Linlin Shen, Michael Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical decision making (CDM) is a complex, dynamic process crucial to healthcare delivery, yet it remains a significant challenge for artificial intelligence systems. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been tested on general medical knowledge using licensing exams and knowledge question-answering tasks, their performance in the CDM in real-world scenarios is limited due to the lack of comprehensive testing datasets that mirror actual medical practice. To address this gap, we present MedChain, a dataset of 12,163 clinical cases that covers five key stages of clinical workflow. MedChain distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks with three key features of real-world clinical practice: personalization, interactivity, and sequentiality. Further, to tackle real-world CDM challenges, we also propose MedChain-Agent, an AI system that integrates a feedback mechanism and a MCase-RAG module to learn from previous cases and adapt its responses. MedChain-Agent demonstrates remarkable adaptability in gathering information dynamically and handling sequential clinical tasks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. The relevant dataset and code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian de Wynter</p>
<p>Abstract: Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT, particularly those outside of its marketed use as task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22 times more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations for research and industry to address loneliness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various benchmarks, yet their ability to engage in deliberate reasoning remains questionable. We present NYT-Connections, a collection of 358 simple word classification puzzles derived from the New York Times Connections game. This benchmark is designed to penalize quick, intuitive "System 1" thinking, isolating fundamental reasoning skills. We evaluated six recent LLMs, a simple machine learning heuristic, and humans across three configurations: single-attempt, multiple attempts without hints, and multiple attempts with contextual hints. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap: even top-performing LLMs like GPT-4 fall short of human performance by nearly 30%. Notably, advanced prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency show diminishing returns as task difficulty increases. NYT-Connections uniquely combines linguistic isolation, resistance to intuitive shortcuts, and regular updates to mitigate data leakage, offering a novel tool for assessing LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pimpitchaya Kositcharoensuk, Nakarin Sritrakool, Ploy N. Pratanwanich</p>
<p>Abstract: Text summarization is a process of condensing lengthy texts while preserving their essential information. Previous studies have predominantly focused on high-resource languages, while low-resource languages like Thai have received less attention. Furthermore, earlier extractive summarization models for Thai texts have primarily relied on the article's body, without considering the headline. This omission can result in the exclusion of key sentences from the summary. To address these limitations, we propose CHIMA, an extractive summarization model that incorporates the contextual information of the headline for Thai news articles. Our model utilizes a pre-trained language model to capture complex language semantics and assigns a probability to each sentence to be included in the summary. By leveraging the headline to guide sentence selection, CHIMA enhances the model's ability to recover important sentences and discount irrelevant ones. Additionally, we introduce two strategies for aggregating headline-body similarities, simple average and harmonic mean, providing flexibility in sentence selection to accommodate varying writing styles. Experiments on publicly available Thai news datasets demonstrate that CHIMA outperforms baseline models across ROUGE, BLEU, and F1 scores. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating the headline-body similarities as model guidance. The results also indicate an enhancement in the model's ability to recall critical sentences, even those scattered throughout the middle or end of the article. With this potential, headline-guided extractive summarization offers a promising approach to improve the quality and relevance of summaries for Thai news articles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamshid Mozafari, Florian Gerhold, Adam Jatowt</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly recently, with individuals frequently interacting with chatbots to receive answers to a wide range of questions. In an era where information is readily accessible, it is crucial to stimulate and preserve human cognitive abilities and maintain strong reasoning skills. This paper addresses such challenges by promoting the use of hints as an alternative or a supplement to direct answers. We first introduce a manually constructed hint dataset, WIKIHINT, which includes 5,000 hints created for 1,000 questions. We then finetune open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3.1 for hint generation in answer-aware and answer-agnostic contexts. We assess the effectiveness of the hints with human participants who try to answer questions with and without the aid of hints. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight evaluation method, HINTRANK, to evaluate and rank hints in both answer-aware and answer-agnostic settings. Our findings show that (a) the dataset helps generate more effective hints, (b) including answer information along with questions generally improves hint quality, and (c) encoder-based models perform better than decoder-based models in hint ranking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Chen, Dongyang Li, Xiaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous prompts have become widely adopted for augmenting performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of this enhancement remains obscure. Previous studies rely on individual words for interpreting continuous prompts, which lacks comprehensive semantic understanding. Drawing inspiration from Concept Bottleneck Models, we propose a framework for interpreting continuous prompts by decomposing them into human-readable concepts. Specifically, to ensure the feasibility of the decomposition, we demonstrate that a corresponding concept embedding matrix and a coefficient matrix can always be found to replace the prompt embedding matrix. Then, we employ GPT-4o to generate a concept pool and choose potential candidate concepts that are discriminative and representative using a novel submodular optimization algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve similar results as the original P-tuning and word-based approaches using only a few concepts while providing more plausible results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler McDonald, Anthony Colosimo, Yifeng Li, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: As prompt engineering research rapidly evolves, evaluations beyond accuracy are crucial for developing cost-effective techniques. We present the Economical Prompting Index (EPI), a novel metric that combines accuracy scores with token consumption, adjusted by a user-specified cost concern level to reflect different resource constraints. Our study examines 6 advanced prompting techniques, including Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Tree of Thoughts, across 10 widely-used language models and 4 diverse datasets. We demonstrate that approaches such as Self-Consistency often provide statistically insignificant gains while becoming cost-prohibitive. For example, on high-performing models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the EPI of simpler techniques like Chain-of-Thought (0.72) surpasses more complex methods like Self-Consistency (0.64) at slight cost concern levels. Our findings suggest a reevaluation of complex prompting strategies in resource-constrained scenarios, potentially reshaping future research priorities and improving cost-effectiveness for end-users.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01708">Are We There Yet? Revealing the Risks of Utilizing Large Language Models in Scholarly Peer Review</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Ye, Xianghe Pang, Jingyi Chai, Jiaao Chen, Zhenfei Yin, Zhen Xiang, Xiaowen Dong, Jing Shao, Siheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Scholarly peer review is a cornerstone of scientific advancement, but the system is under strain due to increasing manuscript submissions and the labor-intensive nature of the process. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their integration into peer review, with promising results such as substantial overlaps between LLM- and human-generated reviews. However, the unchecked adoption of LLMs poses significant risks to the integrity of the peer review system. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM-generated reviews by focusing on manipulation and inherent flaws. Our experiments show that injecting covert deliberate content into manuscripts allows authors to explicitly manipulate LLM reviews, leading to inflated ratings and reduced alignment with human reviews. In a simulation, we find that manipulating 5% of the reviews could potentially cause 12% of the papers to lose their position in the top 30% rankings. Implicit manipulation, where authors strategically highlight minor limitations in their papers, further demonstrates LLMs' susceptibility compared to human reviewers, with a 4.5 times higher consistency with disclosed limitations. Additionally, LLMs exhibit inherent flaws, such as potentially assigning higher ratings to incomplete papers compared to full papers and favoring well-known authors in single-blind review process. These findings highlight the risks of over-reliance on LLMs in peer review, underscoring that we are not yet ready for widespread adoption and emphasizing the need for robust safeguards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in a wide range of applications, they have also been observed to perpetuate unwanted biases present in the training data, potentially leading to harm for marginalized communities. In this paper, we mitigate bias by leveraging small biased and anti-biased expert models to obtain a debiasing signal that will be added to the LLM output at decoding-time. This approach combines resource efficiency with interpretability and can be optimized for mitigating specific types of bias, depending on the target use case. Experiments on mitigating gender, race, and religion biases show a reduction in bias on several local and global bias metrics while preserving language model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzheng Zhang, Lifeng Shen, Yimin Zheng, Shiyuan Piao, Ziyue Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively used for real-world time series forecasting due to their strong natural language understanding capabilities. However, aligning time series into semantic spaces of LLMs comes with high computational costs and inference complexity, particularly for long-range time series generation. Building on recent advancements in using linear models for time series, this paper introduces an LLM-enhanced mixture of linear experts for precise and efficient time series forecasting. This approach involves developing a mixture of linear experts with multiple lookback lengths and a new multimodal fusion mechanism. The use of a mixture of linear experts is efficient due to its simplicity, while the multimodal fusion mechanism adaptively combines multiple linear experts based on the learned features of the text modality from pre-trained large language models. In experiments, we rethink the need to align time series to LLMs by existing time-series large language models and further discuss their efficiency and effectiveness in time series forecasting. Our experimental results show that the proposed LeMoLE model presents lower prediction errors and higher computational efficiency than existing LLM models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in the clinical domain face significant challenges, notably the need to recognise specialised medical vocabulary accurately and meet stringent precision requirements. We introduce United-MedASR, a novel architecture that addresses these challenges by integrating synthetic data generation, precision ASR fine-tuning, and advanced semantic enhancement techniques. United-MedASR constructs a specialised medical vocabulary by synthesising data from authoritative sources such as ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision), MIMS (Monthly Index of Medical Specialties), and FDA databases. This enriched vocabulary helps finetune the Whisper ASR model to better cater to clinical needs. To enhance processing speed, we incorporate Faster Whisper, ensuring streamlined and high-speed ASR performance. Additionally, we employ a customised BART-based semantic enhancer to handle intricate medical terminology, thereby increasing accuracy efficiently. Our layered approach establishes new benchmarks in ASR performance, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.985% on LibriSpeech test-clean, 0.26% on Europarl-ASR EN Guest-test, and demonstrating robust performance on Tedlium (0.29% WER) and FLEURS (0.336% WER). Furthermore, we present an adaptable architecture that can be replicated across different domains, making it a versatile solution for domain-specific ASR systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuofan Wen, Shangtong Gui, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference acceleration of large language models (LLMs) has been put forward in many application scenarios and speculative decoding has shown its advantage in addressing inference acceleration. Speculative decoding usually introduces a draft model to assist the base LLM where the draft model produces drafts and the base LLM verifies the draft for acceptance or rejection. In this framework, the final inference speed is decided by the decoding speed of the draft model and the acceptance rate of the draft provided by the draft model. Currently the widely used draft models usually generate draft tokens for the next several positions in a non-autoregressive way without considering the correlations between draft tokens. Therefore, it has a high decoding speed but an unsatisfactory acceptance rate. In this paper, we focus on how to improve the performance of the draft model and aim to accelerate inference via a high acceptance rate. To this end, we propose a CTC-based draft model which strengthens the correlations between draft tokens during the draft phase, thereby generating higher-quality draft candidate sequences. Experiment results show that compared to strong baselines, the proposed method can achieve a higher acceptance rate and hence a faster inference speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) has garnered significant attention for their ability to scale up neural networks while utilizing the same or even fewer active parameters. However, MoE does not relieve the massive memory requirements of networks, which limits their practicality in real-world applications, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). While recent work explores the possibility of removing entire layers of MoE to reduce memory, the performance degradation is still notable. In this paper, we propose Condense-MoE (CD-MoE} that, instead of dropping the entire MoE layer, condenses the big, sparse MoE layer into a small but dense layer with only a few experts that are activated for all tokens. Our approach is specifically designed for fine-grained MoE with shared experts, where Feed-Forward Networks are split into many small experts, with certain experts isolated to serve as shared experts that are always activated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple MoE models such as DeepSeekMoE and QwenMoE on various benchmarks. Specifically, for the DeepSeekMoE-16B model, our approach maintains nearly 90% of the average accuracy while reducing memory usage by 30% and enhancing inference speed by 30%. Moreover, we show that with lightweight expert fine-tuning, the pruned model can achieve further improvements on specific tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinqi Xiao, Shen Sang, Tiancheng Zhi, Jing Liu, Qing Yan, Linjie Luo, Bo Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large-scale neural networks in vision, and multimodal domains demands substantial memory resources, primarily due to the storage of optimizer states. While LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient method, reduces memory usage, it often suffers from suboptimal performance due to the constraints of low-rank updates. Low-rank gradient projection methods (e.g., GaLore, Flora) reduce optimizer memory by projecting gradients and moment estimates into low-rank spaces via singular value decomposition or random projection. However, they fail to account for inter-projection correlation, causing performance degradation, and their projection strategies often incur high computational costs. In this paper, we present COAP (Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection), a memory-efficient method that minimizes computational overhead while maintaining training performance. Evaluated across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks, COAP outperforms existing methods in both training speed and model performance. For LLaMA-1B, it reduces optimizer memory by 61% with only 2% additional time cost, achieving the same PPL as AdamW. With 8-bit quantization, COAP cuts optimizer memory by 81% and achieves 4x speedup over GaLore for LLaVA-v1.5-7B fine-tuning, while delivering higher accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to process multi-modal data, providing enhanced contextual understanding of complex problems. MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA); however, they often struggle with fundamental engineering problems, and there is a scarcity of specialized datasets for training on topics like digital electronics. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark dataset called ElectroVizQA specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance on digital electronic circuit problems commonly found in undergraduate curricula. This dataset, the first of its kind tailored for the VQA task in digital electronics, comprises approximately 626 visual questions, offering a comprehensive overview of digital electronics topics. This paper rigorously assesses the extent to which MLLMs can understand and solve digital electronic circuit questions, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations within this specialized domain. By introducing this benchmark dataset, we aim to motivate further research and development in the application of MLLMs to engineering education, ultimately bridging the performance gap and enhancing the efficacy of these models in technical fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Kou, Jiachun Jin, Chang Liu, Ye Ma, Jian Jia, Quan Chen, Peng Jiang, Zhijie Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Orthus, an autoregressive (AR) transformer that excels in generating images given textual prompts, answering questions based on visual inputs, and even crafting lengthy image-text interleaved contents. Unlike prior arts on unified multimodal modeling, Orthus simultaneously copes with discrete text tokens and continuous image features under the AR modeling principle. The continuous treatment of visual signals minimizes the information loss for both image understanding and generation while the fully AR formulation renders the characterization of the correlation between modalities straightforward. The key mechanism enabling Orthus to leverage these advantages lies in its modality-specific heads -- one regular language modeling (LM) head predicts discrete text tokens and one diffusion head generates continuous image features conditioning on the output of the backbone. We devise an efficient strategy for building Orthus -- by substituting the Vector Quantization (VQ) operation in the existing unified AR model with a soft alternative, introducing a diffusion head, and tuning the added modules to reconstruct images, we can create an Orthus-base model effortlessly (e.g., within mere 72 A100 GPU hours). Orthus-base can further embrace post-training to better model interleaved images and texts. Empirically, Orthus surpasses competing baselines including Show-o and Chameleon across standard benchmarks, achieving a GenEval score of 0.58 and an MME-P score of 1265.8 using 7B parameters. Orthus also shows exceptional mixed-modality generation capabilities, reflecting the potential for handling intricate practical generation tasks.</p>

Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Lin, Tianyu Zhang, Chengbin Hou, Jinbao Wang, Jianye Xue, Hairong Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Node Importance Estimation (NIE) is a task that quantifies the importance of node in a graph. Recent research has investigated to exploit various information from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to estimate node importance scores. However, the semantic information in KGs could be insufficient, missing, and inaccurate, which would limit the performance of existing NIE models. To address these issues, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic augmentation thanks to the LLMs' extra knowledge and ability of integrating knowledge from both LLMs and KGs. To this end, we propose the LLMs Empowered Node Importance Estimation (LENIE) method to enhance the semantic information in KGs for better supporting NIE tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first work incorporating LLMs into NIE. Specifically, LENIE employs a novel clustering-based triplet sampling strategy to extract diverse knowledge of a node sampled from the given KG. After that, LENIE adopts the node-specific adaptive prompts to integrate the sampled triplets and the original node descriptions, which are then fed into LLMs for generating richer and more precise augmented node descriptions. These augmented descriptions finally initialize node embeddings for boosting the downstream NIE model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate LENIE's effectiveness in addressing semantic deficiencies in KGs, enabling more informative semantic augmentation and enhancing existing NIE models to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Zheng, Shijia Huang, Liwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly impacted various multimodal tasks. However, these models face challenges in tasks that require spatial understanding within 3D environments. Efforts to enhance MLLMs, such as incorporating point cloud features, have been made, yet a considerable gap remains between the models' learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes. This discrepancy largely stems from the training of MLLMs on predominantly 2D data, which restricts their effectiveness in comprehending 3D spaces. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel generalist model, i.e., Video-3D LLM, for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations, our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately. Additionally, we have implemented a maximum coverage sampling technique to optimize the balance between computational costs and performance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edith Haim, Natalie Fischer, Salvatore Citraro, Giulio Rossetti, Massimo Stella</p>
<p>Abstract: Creativity is a fundamental skill of human cognition. We use textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) to extract network (semantic/syntactic associations) and emotional features from approximately one thousand human- and GPT3.5-generated stories. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we test whether features relative to Mednick's associative theory of creativity can explain creativity ratings assigned by humans and GPT-3.5. Using XGBoost, we examine three scenarios: (i) human ratings of human stories, (ii) GPT-3.5 ratings of human stories, and (iii) GPT-3.5 ratings of GPT-generated stories. Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 ratings differ significantly from human ratings not only in terms of correlations but also because of feature patterns identified with XAI methods. GPT-3.5 favours 'its own' stories and rates human stories differently from humans. Feature importance analysis with SHAP scores shows that: (i) network features are more predictive for human creativity ratings but also for GPT-3.5's ratings of human stories; (ii) emotional features played a greater role than semantic/syntactic network structure in GPT-3.5 rating its own stories. These quantitative results underscore key limitations in GPT-3.5's ability to align with human assessments of creativity. We emphasise the need for caution when using GPT-3.5 to assess and generate creative content, as it does not yet capture the nuanced complexity that characterises human creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Wu, Huayi Zhang, Yizheng Jiao, Lin Ma, Xiaozhong Liu, Jinhong Yu, Dongyu Zhang, Dezhi Yu, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human-controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance across diverse NLP tasks, and their integration with speech encoder is rapidly emerging as a dominant trend in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) field. Previous works mainly concentrated on leveraging LLMs for speech recognition in English and Chinese. However, their potential for addressing speech recognition challenges in low resource settings remains underexplored. Hence, in this work, we aim to explore the capability of LLMs in low resource ASR and Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We also evaluate and compare the recognition performance of LLM-based ASR systems against Whisper model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-based ASR yields a relative gain of 12.8\% over the Whisper model in low resource ASR while Whisper performs better in Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We hope that this study could shed light on ASR for low resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Firdavs Nasriddinov, Rafal Kocielnik, Arushi Gupta, Cherine Yang, Elyssa Wong, Anima Anandkumar, Andrew Hung</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces the first framework for reconstructing surgical dialogue from unstructured real-world recordings, which is crucial for characterizing teaching tasks. In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that trainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring safety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill acquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging due to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential to manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured datasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our framework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and automated speech recaognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes hallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition fueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers and trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for reconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of operating room participants. Using data from 33 real-world surgeries, we demonstrated the system's capability to reconstruct surgical teaching dialogues and detect feedback instances effectively (F1 score of 0.79+/-0.07). Moreover, our hallucination removal step improves feedback detection performance by ~14%. Evaluation on downstream clinically relevant tasks of predicting Behavioral Adjustment of trainees and classifying Technical feedback, showed performances comparable to manual annotations with F1 scores of 0.82+/0.03 and 0.81+/0.03 respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in supporting clinically relevant tasks and improving over manual methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhai Zhuo, Zheng Wang, Yuqian Fu, Tianwen Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: The source-free cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) task aims to transfer pretrained models to target domains utilizing minimal samples, eliminating the need for source domain data. Addressing this issue requires models to have robust generalization abilities and strong feature representation, aligning with the characteristics of large-scale pretrained models. However, large-scale models tend to lose representational ability in cross-domain scenarios due to limited sample diversity. \zlh{Given the abundant diversity provided by semantic modality, this paper leverages textual modality to enhance training sample diversity with CLP model}, meanwhile improving model transfer efficiency. Specifically, we propose the SeGD-VPT framework, which is divided into two phases. The first step aims to increase feature diversity by adding diversity prompts to each support sample, thereby generating varying input and enhancing sample diversity. Furthermore, we use diversity descriptions of classes to guide semantically meaningful learning of diversity prompts, proposing random combinations and selections of texts to increase textual diversity. Additionally, deep prompt tuning is introduced to enhance the model's transfer capability. After training of the first step, support samples with different diversity prompts are input into the CLIP backbone to generate enhanced features. After generation, the second phase trains classifiers using the generated features. Extensive experimental results across several benchmarks verify our method is comparable to SOTA source-utilized models and attain the best performance under the source-free CD-FSL setting.</p>

We experimentally investigated the behavior of 10 LLMs in open-domain conversations. We employed 14 questionnaires and a topic-analysis method to examine the behavior of LLMs across four aspects: personality, interpersonal relationships, motivation, and emotion. The results revealed distinct psychological trends influenced by conversation depth and topic, with significant variations observed between different LLM families and parameter sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulius Rauba, Qiyao Wei, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying how an input perturbation impacts the outputs of large language models (LLMs), a fundamental task for model reliability and post-hoc interpretability. A key obstacle in this domain is disentangling the meaningful changes in model responses from the intrinsic stochasticity of LLM outputs. To overcome this, we introduce Distribution-Based Perturbation Analysis (DBPA), a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. DBPA constructs empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling. Comparisons of Monte Carlo estimates in the reduced dimensionality space enables tractable frequentist inference without relying on restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is model-agnostic, supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, yields interpretable p-values, supports multiple perturbation testing via controlled error rates, and provides scalar effect sizes for any chosen similarity or distance metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DBPA in evaluating perturbation impacts, showing its versatility for perturbation analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

<p>Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated that language models can, to a limited extent, represent moral norms in a variety of cultural contexts. This research aims to replicate these findings and further explore their validity, concentrating on issues like 'homosexuality' and 'divorce'. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these models using information from two surveys, the WVS and the PEW, that encompass moral perspectives from over 40 countries. The results show that biases exist in both monolingual and multilingual models, and they typically fall short of accurately capturing the moral intricacies of diverse cultures. However, the BLOOM model shows the best performance, exhibiting some positive correlations, but still does not achieve a comprehensive moral understanding. This research underscores the limitations of current PLMs in processing cross-cultural differences in values and highlights the importance of developing culturally aware AI systems that better align with universal human values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mijntje Meijer, Hadi Mohammadi, Ayoub Bagheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly pivotal in various domains due the recent advancements in their performance capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding biases in LLMs, including gender, racial, and cultural biases derived from their training data. These biases raise critical questions about the ethical deployment and societal impact of LLMs. Acknowledging these concerns, this study investigates whether LLMs accurately reflect cross-cultural variations and similarities in moral perspectives. In assessing whether the chosen LLMs capture patterns of divergence and agreement on moral topics across cultures, three main methods are employed: (1) comparison of model-generated and survey-based moral score variances, (2) cluster alignment analysis to evaluate the correspondence between country clusters derived from model-generated moral scores and those derived from survey data, and (3) probing LLMs with direct comparative prompts. All three methods involve the use of systematic prompts and token pairs designed to assess how well LLMs understand and reflect cultural variations in moral attitudes. The findings of this study indicate overall variable and low performance in reflecting cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral values across the models tested, highlighting the necessity for improving models' accuracy in capturing these nuances effectively. The insights gained from this study aim to inform discussions on the ethical development and deployment of LLMs in global contexts, emphasizing the importance of mitigating biases and promoting fair representation across diverse cultural perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Itamar Pres, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Slonski</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language processing but are prone to memorizing portions of their training data, which can compromise evaluation metrics, raise privacy concerns, and limit generalization. Traditional methods for detecting memorization rely on output probabilities or loss functions, often lacking precision due to confounding factors like common language patterns. In this paper, we introduce an analytical method that precisely detects memorization by examining neuron activations within the LLM. By identifying specific activation patterns that differentiate between memorized and not memorized tokens, we train classification probes that achieve near-perfect accuracy. The approach can also be applied to other mechanisms, such as repetition, as demonstrated in this study, highlighting its versatility. Intervening on these activations allows us to suppress memorization without degrading overall performance, enhancing evaluation integrity by ensuring metrics reflect genuine generalization. Additionally, our method supports large-scale labeling of tokens and sequences, crucial for next-generation AI models, improving training efficiency and results. Our findings contribute to model interpretability and offer practical tools for analyzing and controlling internal mechanisms in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuma Toji, Jun Takahashi, Vwani Roychowdhury, Hideyuki Miyahara</p>
<p>Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades.
  The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities.
  However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking.
  In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context sensitive grammars (CSG), and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model.
  We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly 0 to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider.
  Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase.
  This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but is generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Remfry, Rafael Henkin, Michael R Barnes, Aakanksha Naik</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic healthcare records (EHR) contain a huge wealth of data that can support the prediction of clinical outcomes. EHR data is often stored and analysed using clinical codes (ICD10, SNOMED), however these can differ across registries and healthcare providers. Integrating data across systems involves mapping between different clinical ontologies requiring domain expertise, and at times resulting in data loss. To overcome this, code-agnostic models have been proposed. We assess the effectiveness of a code-agnostic representation approach on the task of long-term microvascular complication prediction for individuals living with Type 2 Diabetes. Our method encodes individual EHRs as text using fine-tuned, pretrained clinical language models. Leveraging large-scale EHR data from the UK, we employ a multi-label approach to simultaneously predict the risk of microvascular complications across 1-, 5-, and 10-year windows. We demonstrate that a code-agnostic approach outperforms a code-based model and illustrate that performance is better with longer prediction windows but is biased to the first occurring complication. Overall, we highlight that context length is vitally important for model performance. This study highlights the possibility of including data from across different clinical ontologies and is a starting point for generalisable clinical models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Museums serve as vital repositories of cultural heritage and historical artifacts spanning diverse epochs, civilizations, and regions, preserving well-documented collections. Data reveal key attributes such as age, origin, material, and cultural significance. Understanding museum exhibits from their images requires reasoning beyond visual features. In this work, we facilitate such reasoning by (a) collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 65M images and 200M question-answer pairs in the standard museum catalog format for exhibits from all around the world; (b) training large vision-language models on the collected dataset; (c) benchmarking their ability on five visual question answering tasks. The complete dataset is labeled by museum experts, ensuring the quality as well as the practical significance of the labels. We train two VLMs from different categories: the BLIP model, with vision-language aligned embeddings, but lacking the expressive power of large language models, and the LLaVA model, a powerful instruction-tuned LLM enriched with vision-language reasoning capabilities. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several insights on the complex and fine-grained understanding of museum exhibits. In particular, we show that some questions whose answers can often be derived directly from visual features are well answered by both types of models. On the other hand, questions that require the grounding of the visual features in repositories of human knowledge are better answered by the large vision-language models, thus demonstrating their superior capacity to perform the desired reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough</p>
<p>Abstract: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heejin Do, Sangwon Ryu, Jonghwi Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing demand to fit fine-grained user intents, faceted query-by-example (QBE), which retrieves similar documents conditioned on specific facets, has gained recent attention. However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle's efficacy in a new domain beyond citation-based scientific paper retrieval, we release a benchmark dataset for educational exam item QBE. FaBle augmentation on 1K documents remarkably assists training in obtaining facet conditional embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyan Sun, Xuanhe Zhou, Guoliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying LLMs like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose R-Bot, an LLM-based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding LLMs to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system, R-Bot, surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibo Xiu, Li Zhang, Tieying Zhang, Jun Yang, Jianjun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems, users often struggle to understand why query plans from one engine (OLAP or OLTP) perform significantly slower than those from another. Although optimizers provide plan details via the EXPLAIN function, these explanations are frequently too technical for non-experts and offer limited insights into performance differences across engines. To address this, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to explain query performance in HTAP systems. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our framework constructs a knowledge base that stores historical query executions and expert-curated explanations. To enable efficient retrieval of relevant knowledge, query plans are embedded using a lightweight tree-CNN classifier. This augmentation allows the LLM to generate clear, context-aware explanations of performance differences between engines. Our approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hybrid engine systems, paving the way for further advancements in database optimization and user support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedant Khandelwal, Vishal Pallagani, Biplav Srivastava, Francesca Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) present significant challenges to artificial intelligence due to their intricate constraints and the necessity for precise solutions. Existing symbolic solvers are often slow, and prior research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) alone struggle with CSPs because of their complexity. To bridge this gap, we build upon the existing SOFAI architecture (or SOFAI-v1), which adapts Daniel Kahneman's ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' cognitive model to AI. Our enhanced architecture, SOFAI-v2, integrates refined metacognitive governance mechanisms to improve adaptability across complex domains, specifically tailored for solving CSPs like graph coloring. SOFAI-v2 combines a fast System 1 (S1) based on LLMs with a deliberative System 2 (S2) governed by a metacognition module. S1's initial solutions, often limited by non-adherence to constraints, are enhanced through metacognitive governance, which provides targeted feedback and examples to adapt S1 to CSP requirements. If S1 fails to solve the problem, metacognition strategically invokes S2, ensuring accurate and reliable solutions. With empirical results, we show that SOFAI-v2 for graph coloring problems achieves a 16.98% increased success rate and is 32.42% faster than symbolic solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ciprian-Octavian Truic\u{a}, Elena-Simona Apostol, Marius Marogel, Adrian Paschke</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's digital age, fake news has become a major problem that has serious consequences, ranging from social unrest to political upheaval. To address this issue, new methods for detecting and mitigating fake news are required. In this work, we propose to incorporate contextual and network-aware features into the detection process. This involves analyzing not only the content of a news article but also the context in which it was shared and the network of users who shared it, i.e., the information diffusion. Thus, we propose GETAE, \underline{G}raph Information \underline{E}nhanced Deep Neural Ne\underline{t}work Ensemble \underline{A}rchitectur\underline{E} for Fake News Detection, a novel ensemble architecture that uses textual content together with the social interactions to improve fake news detection. GETAE contains two Branches: the Text Branch and the Propagation Branch. The Text Branch uses Word and Transformer Embeddings and a Deep Neural Network based on feed-forward and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (\textsc{[Bi]RNN}) for learning novel contextual features and creating a novel Text Content Embedding. The Propagation Branch considers the information propagation within the graph network and proposes a Deep Learning architecture that employs Node Embeddings to create novel Propagation Embedding. GETAE Ensemble combines the two novel embeddings, i.e., Text Content Embedding and Propagation Embedding, to create a novel \textit{Propagation-Enhanced Content Embedding} which is afterward used for classification. The experimental results obtained on two real-world publicly available datasets, i.e., Twitter15 and Twitter16, prove that using this approach improves fake news detection and outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehedi Hasan Bijoy, Nahid Hossain, Salekul Islam, Swakkhar Shatabda</p>
<p>Abstract: Spelling error correction is the task of identifying and rectifying misspelled words in texts. It is a potential and active research topic in Natural Language Processing because of numerous applications in human language understanding. The phonetically or visually similar yet semantically distinct characters make it an arduous task in any language. Earlier efforts on spelling error correction in Bangla and resource-scarce Indic languages focused on rule-based, statistical, and machine learning-based methods which we found rather inefficient. In particular, machine learning-based approaches, which exhibit superior performance to rule-based and statistical methods, are ineffective as they correct each character regardless of its appropriateness. In this paper, we propose a novel detector-purificator-corrector framework, DPCSpell based on denoising transformers by addressing previous issues. In addition to that, we present a method for large-scale corpus creation from scratch which in turn resolves the resource limitation problem of any left-to-right scripted language. The empirical outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by attaining an exact match (EM) score of 94.78%, a precision score of 0.9487, a recall score of 0.9478, an f1 score of 0.948, an f0.5 score of 0.9483, and a modified accuracy (MA) score of 95.16% for Bangla spelling error correction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Rao, Ho Thi-Nga, Chng Eng-Siong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the work of restoring punctuation for ASR transcripts generated by multilingual ASR systems. The focus languages are English, Mandarin, and Malay which are three of the most popular languages in Singapore. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system that can tackle punctuation restoration for these three languages simultaneously. Traditional approaches usually treat the task as a sequential labeling task, however, this work adopts a slot-filling approach that predicts the presence and type of punctuation marks at each word boundary. The approach is similar to the Masked-Language Model approach employed during the pre-training stages of BERT, but instead of predicting the masked word, our model predicts masked punctuation. Additionally, we find that using Jieba1 instead of only using the built-in SentencePiece tokenizer of XLM-R can significantly improve the performance of punctuating Mandarin transcripts. Experimental results on English and Mandarin IWSLT2022 datasets and Malay News show that the proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art results for Mandarin with 73.8% F1-score while maintaining a reasonable F1-score for English and Malay, i.e. 74.7% and 78% respectively. Our source code that allows reproducing the results and building a simple web-based application for demonstration purposes is available on Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: Considerable advancements have been made to tackle the misrepresentation of information derived from reference articles in the domains of fact-checking and faithful summarization. However, an unaddressed aspect remains - the identification of social media posts that manipulate information within associated news articles. This task presents a significant challenge, primarily due to the prevalence of personal opinions in such posts. We present a novel task, identifying manipulation of news on social media, which aims to detect manipulation in social media posts and identify manipulated or inserted information. To study this task, we have proposed a data collection schema and curated a dataset called ManiTweet, consisting of 3.6K pairs of tweets and corresponding articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this task is highly challenging, with large language models (LLMs) yielding unsatisfactory performance. Additionally, we have developed a simple yet effective basic model that outperforms LLMs significantly on the ManiTweet dataset. Finally, we have conducted an exploratory analysis of human-written tweets, unveiling intriguing connections between manipulation and the domain and factuality of news articles, as well as revealing that manipulated sentences are more likely to encapsulate the main story or consequences of a news outlet.</p>

We then use the dataset to perform dialect idefntification. We experiment with traditional ML algorithms, as well as simple DL architectures. The results show very good performance on the task, potentially revealing that the dialects in question have distinct enough characteristics allowing even simple ML models to perform well on the task. Error analysis is performed for the top performing algorithms showing that in a number of cases the errors are due to insufficient dataset cleaning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the importance of long-term memory in marketing and brand building, until now, there has been no large-scale study on the memorability of ads. All previous memorability studies have been conducted on short-term recall on specific content types like action videos. On the other hand, long-term memorability is crucial for the advertising industry, and ads are almost always highly multimodal. Therefore, we release the first memorability dataset, LAMBDA, consisting of 1749 participants and 2205 ads covering 276 brands. Running statistical tests over different participant subpopulations and ad types, we find many interesting insights into what makes an ad memorable, e.g., fast-moving ads are more memorable than those with slower scenes; people who use ad-blockers remember a lower number of ads than those who don't. Next, we present a model, Henry, to predict the memorability of a content. Henry achieves state-of-the-art performance across all prominent literature memorability datasets. It shows strong generalization performance with better results in 0-shot on unseen datasets. Finally, with the intent of memorable ad generation, we present a scalable method to build a high-quality memorable ad generation model by leveraging automatically annotated data. Our approach, SEED (Self rEwarding mEmorability Modeling), starts with a language model trained on LAMBDA as seed data and progressively trains an LLM to generate more memorable ads. We show that the generated advertisements have 44% higher memorability scores than the original ads. We release this large-scale ad dataset, UltraLAMBDA, consisting of 5 million ads. Our code and the datasets, LAMBDA and UltraLAMBDA, are open-sourced at https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/memorability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompting and in-context learning (ICL) have become efficient learning paradigms for large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs suffer from prompt brittleness and various bias factors in the prompt, including but not limited to the formatting, the choice verbalizers, and the ICL examples. To address this problem that results in unexpected performance degradation, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of these biases while recovering LLM performance. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of the existing calibration methods, where we both provide a unified view and reveal the failure cases. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Batch Calibration (BC), a simple yet intuitive method that controls the contextual bias from the batched input, unifies various prior approaches, and effectively addresses the aforementioned issues. BC is zero-shot, inference-only, and incurs negligible additional costs. In the few-shot setup, we further extend BC to allow it to learn the contextual bias from labeled data. We validate the effectiveness of BC with PaLM 2-(S, M, L) and CLIP models and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous calibration baselines across more than 10 natural language understanding and image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of online communication, hate speech detection remains a formidable challenge, further compounded by the diversity of digital platforms. This study investigates the effectiveness and adaptability of pre-trained and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying hate speech, to address two central questions: (1) To what extent does the model performance depend on the fine-tuning and training parameters?, (2) To what extent do models generalize to cross-domain hate speech detection? and (3) What are the specific features of the datasets or models that influence the generalization potential? The experiment shows that LLMs offer a huge advantage over the state-of-the-art even without pretraining. Ordinary least squares analyses suggest that the advantage of training with fine-grained hate speech labels is washed away with the increase in dataset size. We conclude with a vision for the future of hate speech detection, emphasizing cross-domain generalizability and appropriate benchmarking practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern generative language models are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts: meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe them. This framework is flexible enough to account for stochasticity, and allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Experimentally, we test our framework in two active areas of model research: creativity and ideation. We find that user preference strongly favors (p < 0.01) the prompts generated under meta-prompting, as well as their corresponding outputs, over a series of hardcoded baseline prompts that include the original task definition. Using our framework, we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wolf Nuyts, Ruben Cartuyvels, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing visual entities in a natural language sentence and arranging them in a 2D spatial layout require a compositional understanding of language and space. This task of layout prediction is valuable in text-to-image synthesis as it allows localized and controlled in-painting of the image. In this comparative study it is shown that we can predict layouts from language representations that implicitly or explicitly encode sentence syntax, if the sentences mention similar entity-relationships to the ones seen during training. To test compositional understanding, we collect a test set of grammatically correct sentences and layouts describing compositions of entities and relations that unlikely have been seen during training. Performance on this test set substantially drops, showing that current models rely on correlations in the training data and have difficulties in understanding the structure of the input sentences. We propose a novel structural loss function that better enforces the syntactic structure of the input sentence and show large performance gains in the task of 2D spatial layout prediction conditioned on text. The loss has the potential to be used in other generation tasks where a tree-like structure underlies the conditioning modality. Code, trained models and the USCOCO evaluation set are available via github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanchang Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaolin Gao, Kiant\'e Brantley, Thorsten Joachims</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in LLMs offer new opportunities for assisting authors in improving their work. In this paper, we envision a use case where authors can receive LLM-generated reviews that uncover weak points in the current draft. While initial methods for automated review generation already exist, these methods tend to produce reviews that lack detail, and they do not cover the range of opinions that human reviewers produce. To address this shortcoming, we propose an efficient two-stage review generation framework called Reviewer2. Unlike prior work, this approach explicitly models the distribution of possible aspects that the review may address. We show that this leads to more detailed reviews that better cover the range of aspects that human reviewers identify in the draft. As part of the research, we generate a large-scale review dataset of 27k papers and 99k reviews that we annotate with aspect prompts, which we make available as a resource for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishik Rakshit, Smriti Singh, Shuvam Keshari, Arijit Ghosh Chowdhury, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: Embeddings play a pivotal role in the efficacy of Large Language Models. They are the bedrock on which these models grasp contextual relationships and foster a more nuanced understanding of language and consequently perform remarkably on a plethora of complex tasks that require a fundamental understanding of human language. Given that these embeddings themselves often reflect or exhibit bias, it stands to reason that these models may also inadvertently learn this bias. In this work, we build on the seminal previous work and propose DeepSoftDebias, an algorithm that uses a neural network to perform 'soft debiasing'. We exhaustively evaluate this algorithm across a variety of SOTA datasets, accuracy metrics, and challenging NLP tasks. We find that DeepSoftDebias outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at reducing bias across gender, race, and religion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Jing Li, Haoran Xie, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Common approaches rely on fixed-length embedding vectors from language models as sentence embeddings for downstream tasks such as semantic textual similarity (STS). Such methods are limited in their flexibility due to unknown computational constraints and budgets across various applications. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) \cite{aditya2022matryoshka} encodes information at finer granularities, i.e., with lower embedding dimensions, to adaptively accommodate \emph{ad hoc} tasks. Similar accuracy can be achieved with a smaller embedding size, leading to speedups in downstream tasks. Despite its improved efficiency, MRL still requires traversing all Transformer layers before obtaining the embedding, which remains the dominant factor in time and memory consumption. This prompts consideration of whether the fixed number of Transformer layers affects representation quality and whether using intermediate layers for sentence representation is feasible. In this paper, we introduce a novel sentence embedding model called \textit{Two-dimensional Matryoshka Sentence Embedding} (2DMSE)\footnote{Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/SeanLee97/AnglE/blob/main/README_2DMSE.md}.}. It supports elastic settings for both embedding sizes and Transformer layers, offering greater flexibility and efficiency than MRL. We conduct extensive experiments on STS tasks and downstream applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in dynamically supporting different embedding sizes and Transformer layers, allowing it to be highly adaptable to various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heydar Soudani, Evangelos Kanoulas, Faegheh Hasibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of factual knowledge, exhibiting strong performance across diverse tasks and domains. However, it has been observed that the performance diminishes when dealing with less-popular or low-frequency concepts and entities, for example in domain specific applications. The two prominent approaches to enhance the performance of LMs on low-frequent topics are: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning (FT) over synthetic data. This paper explores and evaluates the impact of RAG and FT on customizing LMs in handling low-frequency entities on question answering tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve LMs of varying size and type and different fine tuning, data augmentation, and retrieval models. Our findings indicate that while FT boosts the performance across entities of varying popularity, RAG surpasses FT by a large margin particularly for least popular factual knowledge. Additionally, the success of both RAG and FT approaches is amplified by improving retrieval and data augmentation techniques. Fine tuning, while beneficial for small LMs, requires extensive resources. To address this issue, we propose the new Stimulus RAG approach that surpasses the effectiveness of fine tuning based approaches, thereby eliminating the need for the costly data augmentation and fine tuning step for enriching LMs with less popular factual knowledge.

<p>Abstract: The rise of Multi-modal Pre-training highlights the necessity for a unified Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) representation learning framework. Such a framework is essential for embedding structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models effectively, alleviating issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, we explore the efficacy of models in accurately embedding entities within MMKGs through two pivotal tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking to robustly integrate multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets, demonstrating its versatility. Moreover, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements.

<p>Abstract: Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis, offering critical insights and aiding in informed decision-making. Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings.

<p>Abstract: Prompting is a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models to specific natural language processing tasks without modifying internal parameters. Therefore, detailed supplementary knowledge needs to be integrated into external prompts, which inevitably brings extra human efforts and computational burdens for practical applications. As an effective solution to mitigate resource consumption, Efficient Prompting Methods have attracted a wide range of attention. We provide mathematical expressions at a high level to deeply discuss Automatic Prompt Engineering for different prompt components and Prompt Compression in continuous and discrete spaces.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of "Concept Depth" to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Xu, Ruixuan Huang, Changyu Chen, Xiting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite careful safety alignment, current large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to various attacks. To further unveil the safety risks of LLMs, we introduce a Safety Concept Activation Vector (SCAV) framework, which effectively guides the attacks by accurately interpreting LLMs' safety mechanisms. We then develop an SCAV-guided attack method that can generate both attack prompts and embedding-level attacks with automatically selected perturbation hyperparameters. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our attack method significantly improves the attack success rate and response quality while requiring less training data. Additionally, we find that our generated attack prompts may be transferable to GPT-4, and the embedding-level attacks may also be transferred to other white-box LLMs whose parameters are known. Our experiments further uncover the safety risks present in current LLMs. For example, in our evaluation of seven open-source LLMs, we observe an average attack success rate of 99.14%, based on the classic keyword-matching criterion. Finally, we provide insights into the safety mechanism of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/SproutNan/AI-Safety_SCAV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yan Kang, Hanlin Gu, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in federated large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on enabling clients to fine-tune their locally deployed homogeneous LLMs collaboratively or on transferring knowledge from server-based LLMs to small language models (SLMs) at downstream clients. However, a significant gap remains in the simultaneous mutual enhancement of both the server's LLM and clients' SLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose FedMKT, a parameter-efficient federated mutual knowledge transfer framework for large and small language models. This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum edit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between client-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their performance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a range of NLP text generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that FedMKT simultaneously boosts the performance of both LLMs and SLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Zhang, Yue Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient facts of sociopolitical events are distilled into quadruples following a format of subject, relation, object, and timestamp. Machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been built to make predictions and infer relations on the quadruple-based knowledge graphs (KGs). In many applications, quadruples are extended to quintuples with auxiliary attributes such as text summaries that describe the quadruple events. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate how large language models (LLMs) streamline the design of event prediction frameworks using quadruple-based or quintuple-based data while maintaining competitive accuracy. We propose LEAP, a unified framework that leverages large language models as event predictors. Specifically, we develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF) task, we design a simple yet effective prompt template for each event quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are processed by a customized downstream head with a self-attention mechanism to predict potential relation occurrences in the future. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: A plethora of sentence embedding models makes it challenging to choose one, especially for technical domains rich with specialized vocabulary. In this work, we domain adapt embeddings using telecom, health and science datasets for question answering. We evaluate embeddings obtained from publicly available models and their domain-adapted variants, on both point retrieval accuracies, as well as their (95\%) confidence intervals. We establish a systematic method to obtain thresholds for similarity scores for different embeddings. As expected, we observe that fine-tuning improves mean bootstrapped accuracies. We also observe that it results in tighter confidence intervals, which further improve when pre-training is preceded by fine-tuning. We introduce metrics which measure the distributional overlaps of top-$K$, correct and random document similarities with the question. Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents the Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT uses the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), a prompt selection framework that organizes five distinct prompting strategies by their cognitive load on LLMs. This study introduces the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI) to measure task complexity, which demonstrates LLMs' abilities across different datasets and serves as a universal metric for task complexity. The HPT offers a reliable method for evaluating LLMs' problem-solving skills in diverse scenarios, leading to clearer conclusions. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that the HPF enhances LLM performance by 2\% to 63\% compared to standard benchmark datasets, confirming the effectiveness of the HPT. To support future research in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are publicly available</p>

<p>Abstract: The strong capability of large language models (LLMs) has been applied to information extraction (IE) through either retrieval augmented prompting or instruction tuning (IT). However, the best way to incorporate information with LLMs for IE remains an open question. In this paper, we explore Retrieval Augmented Instruction Tuning (RA-IT) for IE, focusing on the task of open named entity recognition (NER). Specifically, for each training sample, we retrieve semantically similar examples from the training dataset as the context and prepend them to the input of the original instruction. To evaluate our RA-IT approach more thoroughly, we construct a Chinese IT dataset for open NER and evaluate RA-IT in both English and Chinese scenarios. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of RA-IT across various data sizes and in both English and Chinese scenarios. We also conduct thorough studies to explore the impacts of various retrieval strategies in the proposed RA-IT framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya Gao, Hans Moen, Saila Koivusalo, Miika Koskinen, Pekka Marttinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Nursing notes, an important part of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), track a patient's health during a care episode. Summarizing key information in nursing notes can help clinicians quickly understand patients' conditions. However, existing summarization methods in the clinical setting, especially abstractive methods, have overlooked nursing notes and require reference summaries for training. We introduce QGSumm, a novel query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation approach for abstractive nursing note summarization. The method uses patient-related clinical queries for guidance, and hence does not need reference summaries for training. Through automatic experiments and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we study our approach and other state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for nursing note summarization. Our experiments show: 1) GPT-4 is competitive in maintaining information in the original nursing notes, 2) QGSumm can generate high-quality summaries with a good balance between recall of the original content and hallucination rate lower than other top methods. Ultimately, our work offers a new perspective on conditional text summarization, tailored to clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mina Remeli, Moritz Hardt, Robert C. Williamson</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the predictability of online speech on social media, and whether predictability improves with information outside a user's own posts. Recent theoretical results suggest that posts from a user's social circle are as predictive of the user's future posts as that of the user's past posts. Motivated by the success of large language models, we empirically test this hypothesis. We define predictability as a measure of the model's uncertainty, i.e., its negative log-likelihood on future tokens given context. As the basis of our study, we collect 10M tweets for ``tweet-tuning'' base models and a further 6.25M posts from more than five thousand X (previously Twitter) users and their peers. Across four large language models ranging in size from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters, we find that predicting a user's posts from their peers' posts performs poorly. Moreover, the value of the user's own posts for prediction is consistently higher than that of their peers'. We extend our investigation with a detailed analysis on what's learned in-context and the robustness of our findings. From context, base models learn to correctly predict @-mentions and hashtags. Moreover, our results replicate if instead of prompting the model with additional context, we finetune on it. Across the board, we find that predicting the posts of individual users remains hard.</p>

In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information: byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with example data for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o and Mistral NeMo's tokenizers are much more multilingual than their predecessors, training on 39% and 47% non-English language data, respectively; Llama 3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacan Yu, Hannah An, Lenhart K. Schubert</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps. However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) receives the information from the user and answers the question. This design is intended to make better use of the LM's instruction-following capability. PREP is applicable across various QA tasks without domain-specific prompt engineering. PREP is developed on a dataset of 100 QA questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset specifying artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our parts-and-materials dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuba Gokhan, Kexin Wang, Iryna Gurevych, Ted Briscoe</p>
<p>Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance. Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary field aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We introduce a task of generating question-passages pairs, where questions are automatically created and paired with relevant regulatory passages, facilitating the development of regulatory question-answering systems. We create the ObliQA dataset, containing 27,869 questions derived from the collection of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation documents, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation (RIRAG) system and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations while avoiding contradictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Wang, Tatiana Anikina, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Sebastian M\"oller, Vera Schmitt</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language explanations (NLEs) are vital for elucidating the reasoning behind large language model (LLM) decisions. Many techniques have been developed to generate NLEs using LLMs. However, like humans, LLMs might not always produce optimal NLEs on first attempt. Inspired by human learning processes, we introduce Cross-Refine, which employs role modeling by deploying two LLMs as generator and critic, respectively. The generator outputs a first NLE and then refines this initial explanation using feedback and suggestions provided by the critic. Cross-Refine does not require any supervised training data or additional training. We validate Cross-Refine across three NLP tasks using three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs through automatic and human evaluation. We select Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) as the baseline, which only utilizes self-feedback to refine the explanations. Our findings from automatic evaluation and a user study indicate that Cross-Refine outperforms Self-Refine. Meanwhile, Cross-Refine can perform effectively with less powerful LLMs, whereas Self-Refine only yields strong results with ChatGPT. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess the importance of feedback and suggestions. Both of them play an important role in refining explanations. We further evaluate Cross-Refine on a bilingual dataset in English and German.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahan Tu, Rui Hu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination poses a persistent challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating hallucinations are generally static, which may overlook the potential risk of data contamination. To address this issue, we propose ODE, an open-set, dynamic protocol designed to evaluate object hallucinations in MLLMs at both the existence and attribute levels. ODE employs a graph-based structure to represent real-world object concepts, their attributes, and the distributional associations between them. This structure facilitates the extraction of concept combinations based on diverse distributional criteria, generating varied samples for structured queries that evaluate hallucinations in both generative and discriminative tasks. Through the generation of new samples, dynamic concept combinations, and varied distribution frequencies, ODE mitigates the risk of data contamination and broadens the scope of evaluation. This protocol is applicable to both general and specialized scenarios, including those with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol, revealing that MLLMs exhibit higher hallucination rates when evaluated with ODE-generated samples, which indicates potential data contamination. Furthermore, these generated samples aid in analyzing hallucination patterns and fine-tuning models, offering an effective approach to mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Guan, Nathaniel Demchak, Saloni Gupta, Ze Wang, Ediz Ertekin Jr., Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim, Zekun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of unbiased large language models is widely recognized as crucial, yet existing benchmarks fall short in detecting biases due to limited scope, contamination, and lack of a fairness baseline. SAGED(-Bias) is the first holistic benchmarking pipeline to address these problems. The pipeline encompasses five core stages: scraping materials, assembling benchmarks, generating responses, extracting numeric features, and diagnosing with disparity metrics. SAGED includes metrics for max disparity, such as impact ratio, and bias concentration, such as Max Z-scores. Noticing that assessment tool bias and contextual bias in prompts can distort evaluation, SAGED implements counterfactual branching and baseline calibration for mitigation. For demonstration, we use SAGED on G20 Countries with popular 8b-level models including Gemma2, Llama3.1, Mistral, and Qwen2. With sentiment analysis, we find that while Mistral and Qwen2 show lower max disparity and higher bias concentration than Gemma2 and Llama3.1, all models are notably biased against countries like Russia and (except for Qwen2) China. With further experiments to have models role-playing U.S. (vice-/former-) presidents, we see bias amplifies and shifts in heterogeneous directions. Moreover, we see Qwen2 and Mistral not engage in role-playing, while Llama3.1 and Gemma2 role-play Trump notably more intensively than Biden and Harris, indicating role-playing performance bias in these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengfei Liang, Archish Arun, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Jonathan Lutch, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama, Philip Treleaven</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect content, is a growing challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL. Additionally, PEFT significantly enhances the performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in both evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo King, Zekun Wu, Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim, Philip Treleaven</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereotypes are generalised assumptions about societal groups, and even state-of-the-art LLMs using in-context learning struggle to identify them accurately. Due to the subjective nature of stereotypes, where what constitutes a stereotype can vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives, robust explainability is crucial. Explainable models ensure that these nuanced judgments can be understood and validated by human users, promoting trust and accountability. We address these challenges by introducing HEARTS (Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection), a framework that enhances model performance, minimises carbon footprint, and provides transparent, interpretable explanations. We establish the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD), comprising 57,201 labelled texts across six groups, including under-represented demographics like LGBTQ+ and regional stereotypes. Ablation studies confirm that BERT models fine-tuned on EMGSD outperform those trained on individual components. We then analyse a fine-tuned, carbon-efficient ALBERT-V2 model using SHAP to generate token-level importance values, ensuring alignment with human understanding, and calculate explainability confidence scores by comparing SHAP and LIME outputs...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Yang, Jinhao Chen, Zhengxiao Du, Wenmeng Yu, Weihan Wang, Wenyi Hong, Zhihuan Jiang, Bin Xu, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in mathematical reasoning, particularly with text-based mathematical problems. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), especially those specialized in mathematics, tend to focus predominantly on solving geometric problems but ignore the diversity of visual information available in other areas of mathematics. Moreover, the geometric information for these specialized mathematical MLLMs is derived from several public datasets, which are typically limited in diversity and complexity. To address these limitations, we aim to construct a fine-tuning dataset named MathVL, and develop a series of specialized mathematical MLLMs termed MathGLM-Vision by conducting Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on MathVL with various parameter-scale backbones. To extensively evaluate the effectiveness of MathGLM-Vision, we conduct experiments on several public benchmarks and our curated MathVL-test consisting of 2,000 problems. Experimental results demonstrate that MathGLM-Vision achieves significant improvements compared with some existing models, including backbone models and open-source mathematical MLLMs. These findings indicate the importance of diversity dataset in enhancing the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) today may not necessarily provide culturally appropriate and relevant responses to its Filipino users. We introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has become a crucial paradigm for managing the growing complexity of modern software systems, particularly in fields like machine learning, deep learning, large language models (LLM), and data analytics. This work provides a comprehensive introduction to the integration of OOP techniques within these domains, with a focus on improving code modularity, maintainability, and scalability. We begin by outlining the evolution of computing and the rise of OOP, followed by an in-depth discussion of key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The practical application of these principles is demonstrated using Python, a widely adopted language in AI and data science. Furthermore, we examine how design patterns and modular programming can be employed to enhance the structure and efficiency of machine learning systems. In subsequent sections, we apply these OOP concepts to real-world AI tasks, including the encapsulation of preprocessing workflows, machine learning model training, and evaluation. Detailed examples illustrate how OOP can be used to build reusable, scalable machine learning systems while maintaining code clarity and reducing redundancy.This work is intended to serve as a bridge for both beginners and experienced developers, equipping them with the necessary knowledge to apply OOP methodologies in AI-driven projects, ultimately fostering the development of more robust and maintainable systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of text generation models has granted us the capability to produce coherent and convincing text on demand. Yet, in real-life circumstances, individuals do not continuously generate text or voice their opinions. For instance, consumers pen product reviews after weighing the merits and demerits of a product, and professional analysts issue reports following significant news releases. In essence, opinion expression is typically prompted by particular reasons or signals. Despite long-standing developments in opinion mining, the appropriate timing for expressing an opinion remains largely unexplored. To address this deficit, our study introduces an innovative task - the identification of news-triggered opinion expressing timing. We ground this task in the actions of professional stock analysts and develop a novel dataset for investigation. Our approach is decision-focused, leveraging text generation models to steer the classification model, thus enhancing overall performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the text generated by our model contributes fresh insights from various angles, effectively aiding in identifying the optimal timing for opinion expression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hyowon Cho, Joel Jang, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungpil Won, Youbin Ahn, Dohaeng Lee, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate how a model's tendency to broadly integrate its parametric knowledge evolves throughout pretraining, and how this behavior affects overall performance, particularly in terms of knowledge acquisition and forgetting. We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the range of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy indicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low knowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty. Our analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining advances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction in the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude that diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources) impairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find further support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of inactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition and retention.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose cognitive prompting as a novel approach to guide problem-solving in large language models (LLMs) through structured, human-like cognitive operations, such as goal clarification, decomposition, filtering, abstraction, and pattern recognition. By employing systematic, step-by-step reasoning, cognitive prompting enables LLMs to tackle complex, multi-step tasks more efficiently. We introduce three variants: a deterministic sequence of cognitive operations, a self-adaptive variant in which the LLM dynamically selects the sequence of cognitive operations, and a hybrid variant that uses generated correct solutions as few-shot chain-of-thought prompts. Experiments with LLaMA, Gemma~2, and Qwen models in each two sizes on the arithmetic reasoning benchmark GSM8K demonstrate that cognitive prompting significantly improves performance compared to standard question answering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are rapidly transforming chip design by addressing key barriers of commercial EDA tools such as complexity, costs, and access. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have further enhanced efficiency in chip design by providing user assistance across a range of tasks like setup, decision-making, and flow automation. This paper introduces ORAssistant, a conversational assistant for OpenROAD, based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). ORAssistant aims to improve the user experience for the OpenROAD flow, from RTL-GDSII by providing context-specific responses to common user queries, including installation, command usage, flow setup, and execution, in prose format. Currently, ORAssistant integrates OpenROAD, OpenROAD-flow-scripts, Yosys, OpenSTA, and KLayout. The data model is built from publicly available documentation and GitHub resources. The proposed architecture is scalable, supporting extensions to other open-source tools, operating modes, and LLM models. We use Google Gemini as the base LLM model to build and test ORAssistant. Early evaluation results of the RAG-based model show notable improvements in performance and accuracy compared to non-fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reranking documents based on their relevance to a given query is a critical task in information retrieval. Traditional reranking methods often lack transparency and rely on proprietary models, hindering reproducibility and interpretability. We propose Reason-to-Rank (R2R), a novel open-source reranking approach that enhances transparency by generating two types of reasoning: direct relevance reasoning, which explains how a document addresses the query, and comparison reasoning, which justifies the relevance of one document over another. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as teacher models to generate these explanations and distill this knowledge into smaller, openly available student models. Our student models are trained to generate meaningful reasoning and rerank documents, achieving competitive performance across multiple datasets, including MSMARCO and BRIGHT. Experiments demonstrate that R2R not only improves reranking accuracy but also provides valuable insights into the decision-making process. By offering a structured and interpretable solution with openly accessible resources, R2R aims to bridge the gap between effectiveness and transparency in information retrieval, fostering reproducibility and further research in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshara Prabhakar, Yuanzhi Li, Karthik Narasimhan, Sham Kakade, Eran Malach, Samy Jelassi</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). We study how different LoRA modules can be merged to achieve skill composition -- testing the performance of the merged model on a target task that involves combining multiple skills, each skill coming from a single LoRA. This setup is favorable when it is difficult to obtain training data for the target task and when it can be decomposed into multiple skills. First, we identify practically occurring use-cases that can be studied under the realm of skill composition, e.g. solving hard math-word problems with code, creating a bot to answer questions on proprietary manuals or about domain-specialized corpora. Our main contribution is to show that concatenation of LoRAs (CAT), which optimally weights LoRAs that were individually trained on different skills, outperforms existing model- and data- merging techniques; for instance on math-word problems, CAT beats these methods by an average of 43% and 12% respectively. Thus, this paper advocates model merging as an efficient way to solve compositional tasks and underscores CAT as a simple, compute-friendly and effective procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the superiority of model merging over data mixing for binary skill composition tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guimin Hu, Hasti Seifi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their impressive performance. While considerable research has evaluated these models from various perspectives, the extent to which LLMs can perform implicit and explicit emotion retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study investigates LLMs' emotion retrieval capabilities in commonsense. Through extensive experiments involving multiple models, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs on emotion retrieval. Specifically, we propose a supervised contrastive probing method to verify LLMs' performance for implicit and explicit emotion retrieval, as well as the diversity of the emotional events they retrieve. The results offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in handling emotion retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into medical applications has sparked widespread interest across the healthcare industry, from drug discovery and development to clinical decision support, assisting telemedicine, medical devices, and healthcare insurance applications. This perspective paper aims to discuss the inner workings of building LLM-powered medical AI applications and introduces a comprehensive framework for their development. We review existing literature and outline the unique challenges of applying LLMs in specialized medical contexts. Additionally, we introduce a three-step framework to organize medical LLM research activities: 1) Modeling: breaking down complex medical workflows into manageable steps for developing medical-specific models; 2) Optimization: optimizing the model performance with crafted prompts and integrating external knowledge and tools, and 3) System engineering: decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and leveraging human expertise for building medical AI applications. Furthermore, we offer a detailed use case playbook that describes various LLM-powered medical AI applications, such as optimizing clinical trial design, enhancing clinical decision support, and advancing medical imaging analysis. Finally, we discuss various challenges and considerations for building medical AI applications with LLMs, such as handling hallucination issues, data ownership and compliance, privacy, intellectual property considerations, compute cost, sustainability issues, and responsible AI requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usafa Akther Rifa, Pronay Debnath, Busra Kamal Rafa, Shamaun Safa Hridi, Md. Aminur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, YouTube has become the leading platform for Bangla movies and dramas, where viewers express their opinions in comments that convey their sentiments about the content. However, not all comments are relevant for sentiment analysis, necessitating a filtering mechanism. We propose a system that first assesses the relevance of comments and then analyzes the sentiment of those deemed relevant. We introduce a dataset of 14,000 manually collected and preprocessed comments, annotated for relevance (relevant or irrelevant) and sentiment (positive or negative). Eight transformer models, including BanglaBERT, were used for classification tasks, with BanglaBERT achieving the highest accuracy (83.99% for relevance detection and 93.3% for sentiment analysis). The study also integrates LIME to interpret model decisions, enhancing transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Huang, Arya Somasundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often perpetuate biases in pronoun usage, leading to misrepresentation or exclusion of queer individuals. This paper addresses the specific problem of biased pronoun usage in LLM outputs, particularly the inappropriate use of traditionally gendered pronouns ("he," "she") when inclusive language is needed to accurately represent all identities. We introduce a collaborative agent pipeline designed to mitigate these biases by analyzing and optimizing pronoun usage for inclusivity. Our multi-agent framework includes specialized agents for both bias detection and correction. Experimental evaluations using the Tango dataset-a benchmark focused on gender pronoun usage-demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inclusive pronoun classification, achieving a 32.6 percentage point increase over GPT-4o in correctly disagreeing with inappropriate traditionally gendered pronouns $(\chi^2 = 38.57, p < 0.0001)$. These results accentuate the potential of agent-driven frameworks in enhancing fairness and inclusivity in AI-generated content, demonstrating their efficacy in reducing biases and promoting socially responsible AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keer Lu, Keshi Zhao, Zheng Liang, Da Pan, Shusen Zhang, Xin Wu, Weipeng Chen, Zenan Zhou, Guosheng Dong, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pretrained models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in handling multiple tasks across domains due to their emergent properties. These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability performances during training. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains including law, medicine, finance, science, code, etc. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the training data composition that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the training process, domain weights are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant improvements in multi-domain performance, with an 35.21% enhancement in comprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific domain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of performance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target domain's training efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and their capacity to simulate human cognition and behavior has given rise to LLM-based frameworks and tools that are evaluated and applied based on their ability to perform tasks traditionally performed by humans, namely those involving cognition, decision-making, and social interaction. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of such human-centric LLM capabilities, focusing on their performance in both individual tasks (where an LLM acts as a stand-in for a single human) and collective tasks (where multiple LLMs coordinate to mimic group dynamics). We first evaluate LLM competencies across key areas including reasoning, perception, and social cognition, comparing their abilities to human-like skills. Then, we explore real-world applications of LLMs in human-centric domains such as behavioral science, political science, and sociology, assessing their effectiveness in replicating human behaviors and interactions. Finally, we identify challenges and future research directions, such as improving LLM adaptability, emotional intelligence, and cultural sensitivity, while addressing inherent biases and enhancing frameworks for human-AI collaboration. This survey aims to provide a foundational understanding of LLMs from a human-centric perspective, offering insights into their current capabilities and potential for future development.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17593">What Differentiates Educational Literature? A Multimodal Fusion Approach of Transformers and Computational Linguistics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan J. Bird</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal approaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference time. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17607">Scaling Speech-Text Pre-training with Synthetic Interleaved Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aohan Zeng, Zhengxiao Du, Mingdao Liu, Lei Zhang, Shengmin Jiang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech language models (SpeechLMs) accept speech input and produce speech output, allowing for more natural human-computer interaction compared to text-based large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches for developing SpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech data and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant than text pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose a novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale synthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for parallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text interleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and synthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing the need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech tokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised training approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic preservation even at lower frame rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining speech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and scaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved speech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language modeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken questions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%. We further demonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue data, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive performance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities and speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhay Shanbhag, Suramya Jadhav, Amogh Thakurdesai, Ridhima Sinare, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages presents significant challenges, particularly due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and linguistic resources. The choice of embeddings plays a critical role in enhancing the performance of NLP tasks, such as news classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, especially for low-resource languages like Marathi. In this study, we investigate the impact of various embedding techniques- Contextual BERT-based, Non-Contextual BERT-based, and FastText-based on NLP classification tasks specific to the Marathi language. Our research includes a thorough evaluation of both compressed and uncompressed embeddings, providing a comprehensive overview of how these embeddings perform across different scenarios. Specifically, we compare two BERT model embeddings, Muril and MahaBERT, as well as two FastText model embeddings, IndicFT and MahaFT. Our evaluation includes applying embeddings to a Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) classifier for task performance assessment, as well as TSNE visualizations to observe the spatial distribution of these embeddings. The results demonstrate that contextual embeddings outperform non-contextual embeddings. Furthermore, BERT-based non-contextual embeddings extracted from the first BERT embedding layer yield better results than FastText-based embeddings, suggesting a potential alternative to FastText embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Scir\`e, Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Simone Tedeschi, Karim Ghonim, Federico Martelli, Roberto Navigli</p>
<p>Abstract: After the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been substantial improvements in the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Text Summarization and Machine Translation. However, LLMs still produce outputs containing hallucinations, that is, content not grounded in factual information. Therefore, developing methods to assess the factuality of LLMs has become urgent.
  Indeed, resources for factuality evaluation have recently emerged. Although challenging, these resources face one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are tailored to a specific task or domain; (ii) they are limited in size, thereby preventing the training of new factuality evaluators; (iii) they are designed for simpler verification tasks, such as claim verification.
  To address these issues, we introduce LLM-Oasis, to the best of our knowledge the largest resource for training end-to-end factuality evaluators. LLM-Oasis is constructed by extracting claims from Wikipedia, falsifying a subset of these claims, and generating pairs of factual and unfactual texts. We then rely on human annotators to both validate the quality of our dataset and to create a gold standard test set for benchmarking factuality evaluation systems.
  Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Oasis presents a significant challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs, with GPT-4o achieving up to 60% accuracy in our proposed end-to-end factuality evaluation task, highlighting its potential to drive future research in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) contribution to translation industry (ACTI) research, synthesizing it over forty-one years from 1980-2024. 13220 articles were retrieved from three sources, namely WoS, Scopus, and Lens. We provided two types of analysis, viz., scientometric and thematic, focusing on cluster, subject categories, keywords, burstness, centrality and research centers as for the former. For the latter, we thematically review 18 articles, selected purposefully from the articles involved, centering on purpose, approach, findings, and contribution to ACTI future directions. The findings reveal that in the past AI contribution to translation industry was not rigorous, resulting in rule-based machine translation and statistical machine translation whose output was not satisfactory. However, the more AI develops, the more machine translation develops, incorporating Neural Networking Algorithms and (Deep) Language Learning Models like ChatGPT whose translation output has developed considerably. However, much rigorous research is still needed to overcome several problems encountering translation industry, specifically concerning low-source languages, multi-dialectical and free word order languages, and cultural and religious registers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Lin, Tian Liang, Jiahao Xu, Xing Wang, Ruilin Luo, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Yujiu Yang, Zhaopeng Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose MM-Vet, an evaluation benchmark that examines large multimodal models (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. Recent LMMs have shown various intriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard, reasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual jokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark development. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate the complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that work well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights beyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed based on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is often achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core vision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability combination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for open-ended outputs. The evaluator enables the evaluation across different question types and answer styles, resulting in a unified scoring metric. We evaluate representative LMMs on MM-Vet, providing insights into the capabilities of different LMM system paradigms and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Z Liu, J Lou, W Bao, Y Hu, B Li, Z Qin, K Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD.
  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.
  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\%$ on MNLI with RoBERTa-Large and 9.2\% on CB, 3.9\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\epsilon=4$, demonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated tasks).</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Yang, Guodong Long, Tao Shen, Jing Jiang, Michael Blumenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning diverse instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models (FedFM) emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to FedFM for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications, and conventional methods for test-time distribution shifts in personalized FL are less effective for FedFM due to their failure to adapt to complex distribution shift scenarios and the requirement to train all parameters. To bridge this gap, we refine the setting in FedFM, termed test-time personalization, which aims to learn personalized federated foundation models on clients while effectively handling test-time distribution shifts simultaneously. To address challenges in this setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution, a Federated Dual-Personalizing Adapter (FedDPA) architecture. By co-working with a foundation model, a global adapter and a local adapter jointly tackle the test-time distribution shifts and client-specific personalization. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism that dynamically integrates the global and local adapters for each test instance during inference, facilitating effective test-time personalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Feng Ruan, Huiyuan Wang, Qi Long, Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.</p>

We show they are equivalent to each other, and that together they are the best-known lower bound on the formal expressivity of future-masked soft attention transformers with unbounded input size. We prove this by showing all $\textsf{K}_\text{t}$[#] formulas can be compiled into these transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Blocklove, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities for producing code in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, most of the focus remains on their abilities to write functional code, not test code. The hardware design process consists of both design and test, and so eschewing validation and verification leaves considerable potential benefit unexplored, given that a design and test framework may allow for progress towards full automation of the digital design pipeline. In this work, we perform one of the first studies exploring how a LLM can both design and test hardware modules from provided specifications. Using a suite of 8 representative benchmarks, we examined the capabilities and limitations of the state-of-the-art conversational LLMs when producing Verilog for functional and verification purposes. We taped out the benchmarks on a Skywater 130nm shuttle and received the functional chip.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Fang, Lei Wang, Ce Zheng, Chunyu Sui, Mingyu Zhao, Yapeng Tian, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose SignLLM, a multilingual Sign Language Production (SLP) large language model, which includes two novel multilingual SLP modes MLSF and Prompt2LangGloss that allow sign language gestures generation from query texts input and question-style prompts input respectively. Both modes can use a new RL loss based on reinforcement learning and a new RL module named Priority Learning Channel. These RL components can accelerate the training by enhancing the model's capability to sample high-quality data. For SignLLM's training, we introduce Prompt2Sign, a comprehensive multilingual sign language dataset, which builds from public data, including American Sign Language (ASL) and seven others. This dataset standardizes information by extracting pose information from sign language videos into a unified compressed format. We extensively evaluate SignLLM, demonstrating that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on SLP tasks across eight sign languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayneel Parekh, Pegah Khayatan, Mustafa Shukor, Alasdair Newson, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as ``multi-modal concepts''. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Li, Yi Liu, Chongyang Liu, Xiaoning Ren, Ling Shi, Weisong Sun, Yinxing Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's LLaMa have shown remarkable capabilities in text generation. However, their susceptibility to toxic prompts presents significant security challenges. This paper investigates alignment techniques, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), to mitigate these risks. We conduct an empirical study on refusal patterns across nine LLMs, revealing that models with uniform refusal patterns, such as Claude3, exhibit higher security. Based on these findings, we propose self-distilling and cross-model distilling methods to enhance LLM security. Our results show that these methods significantly improve refusal rates and reduce unsafe content, with cross-model distilling achieving refusal rates close to Claude3's 94.51%. These findings underscore the potential of distillation-based alignment in securing LLMs against toxic prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many recently published Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems produce audio close to real speech. However, TTS evaluation needs to be revisited to make sense of the results obtained with the new architectures, approaches and datasets. We propose evaluating the quality of synthetic speech as a combination of multiple factors such as prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. Our approach assesses how well synthetic speech mirrors real speech by obtaining correlates of each factor and measuring their distance from both real speech datasets and noise datasets. We benchmark 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and show that our score computed as an unweighted average of factors strongly correlates with the human evaluations from each time period.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Zhengyuan Yang, Lingfeng Ren, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Zicheng Liu, Lijuan Wang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: MM-Vet, with open-ended vision-language questions targeting at evaluating integrated capabilities, has become one of the most popular benchmarks for large multimodal model evaluation. MM-Vet assesses six core vision-language (VL) capabilities: recognition, knowledge, spatial awareness, language generation, OCR, and math. However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce MM-Vet v2, which includes a new VL capability called "image-text sequence understanding", evaluating models' ability to process VL sequences. Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size. Using MM-Vet v2 to benchmark large multimodal models, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best model with a score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o which scored 71.0. Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B leads with a score of 68.4. The code, data, and leaderboard are accessible at https://github.com/yuweihao/MM-Vet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyi Zhang, Hao Frank Yang, Ang Li, Xin Guo, Pu Wang, Haiming Wang, Yiran Chen, Hai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies on federated learning (FL) often encounter performance degradation due to data heterogeneity among different clients. In light of the recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4v and LLaVA, which demonstrate their exceptional proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and multimodal question answering. We introduce a novel federated learning framework, named Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning (MLLM-LLaVA-FL), which employs powerful MLLMs at the server end to address the heterogeneous and long-tailed challenges. Owing to the advanced cross-modality representation capabilities and the extensive open-vocabulary prior knowledge of MLLMs, our framework is adept at harnessing the extensive, yet previously underexploited, open-source data accessible from websites and powerful server-side computational resources. Hence, the MLLM-LLaVA-FL not only enhances the performance but also avoids increasing the risk of privacy leakage and the computational burden on local devices, distinguishing it from prior methodologies. Our framework has three key stages. Initially, we conduct global visual-text pretraining of the model. This pretraining is facilitated by utilizing the extensive open-source data available online, with the assistance of MLLMs. Subsequently, the pretrained model is distributed among various clients for local training. Finally, once the locally trained models are transmitted back to the server, a global alignment is carried out under the supervision of MLLMs to further enhance the performance. Experimental evaluations on established benchmarks, show that our framework delivers promising performance in the typical scenarios with data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution across different clients in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihuan Jiang, Zhen Yang, Jinhao Chen, Zhengxiao Du, Weihan Wang, Bin Xu, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities across various tasks by integrating textual and visual information to achieve visual understanding in complex scenarios. Despite the availability of several benchmarks aims to evaluating MLLMs in tasks from visual question answering to complex problem-solving, most focus predominantly on mathematics or general visual understanding tasks. This reveals a critical gap in current benchmarks, which often overlook the inclusion of other key scientific disciplines such as physics and chemistry. To address this gap, we meticulously construct a comprehensive benchmark, named VisScience, which is utilized to assess the multi-modal scientific reasoning across the three disciplines of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This benchmark comprises 3,000 questions drawn from K12 education - spanning elementary school through high school - equally distributed across three disciplines, with 1,000 questions per discipline. The questions within VisScience span 21 distinct subjects and are categorized into five difficulty levels, offering a broad spectrum of topics within each discipline. With VisScience, we present a detailed evaluation of the performance of 25 representative MLLMs in scientific reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that closed-source MLLMs generally outperform open-source models. The best performance observed include a 53.4\% accuracy in mathematics by Claude3.5-Sonnet, 38.2\% in physics by GPT-4o, and 47.0\% in chemistry by Gemini-1.5-Pro. These results underscore the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, suggesting areas for future improvement and highlighting the importance of developing models that can effectively handle the diverse demands of multi-modal scientific reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, Shiyi Wang, Wenqing Zhong, Nianchen Shen, Yunqi Li, Siqi Wang, Zhiheng Li, Cathy Wu, Zhengbing He, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $<0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Oscar Yin, Alexander M. Rush</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. For compute-optimal training, we find that perplexity and gradient data selection require training-to-selection model size ratios of 5x and 10x, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials science. However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standardized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hinders progress. We present LLM4Mat-Bench, the largest benchmark to date for evaluating the performance of LLMs in predicting the properties of crystalline materials. LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total, collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct properties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal composition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B tokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and provide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The results highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science and the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific instruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: When learning an input-output mapping from very few examples, is it better to first infer a latent function that explains the examples, or is it better to directly predict new test outputs, e.g. using a neural network? We study this question on ARC by training neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). We train on synthetically generated variations of Python programs that solve ARC training tasks. We find inductive and transductive models solve different kinds of test problems, despite having the same training problems and sharing the same neural architecture: Inductive program synthesis excels at precise computations, and at composing multiple concepts, while transduction succeeds on fuzzier perceptual concepts. Ensembling them approaches human-level performance on ARC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanishq Kumar, Zachary Ankner, Benjamin F. Spector, Blake Bordelon, Niklas Muennighoff, Mansheej Paul, Cengiz Pehlevan, Christopher R\'e, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Low precision training and inference affect both the quality and cost of language models, but current scaling laws do not account for this. In this work, we devise "precision-aware" scaling laws for both training and inference. We propose that training in lower precision reduces the model's "effective parameter count," allowing us to predict the additional loss incurred from training in low precision and post-train quantization. For inference, we find that the degradation introduced by post-training quantization increases as models are trained on more data, eventually making additional pretraining data actively harmful. For training, our scaling laws allow us to predict the loss of a model with different parts in different precisions, and suggest that training larger models in lower precision may be compute optimal. We unify the scaling laws for post and pretraining quantization to arrive at a single functional form that predicts degradation from training and inference in varied precisions. We fit on over 465 pretraining runs and validate our predictions on model sizes up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Jiangxuan Long, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the Arithmetic formula evaluation problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical result not only establishes the complexity bound but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</p>

In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fine-grained alignment in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, where robots navigate realistic 3D environments based on natural language instructions. Current approaches use contrastive learning to align language with visual trajectory sequences. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties with fine-grained vision negatives. To enhance cross-modal embeddings, we introduce a novel Bayesian Optimization-based adversarial optimization framework for creating fine-grained contrastive vision samples. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of the enriched embeddings on fine-grained vision negatives. We conduct experiments on two common VLN benchmarks R2R and REVERIE, experiments on the them demonstrate that these embeddings benefit navigation, and can lead to a promising performance enhancement.

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data. The code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.</p>
