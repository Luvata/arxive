<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Jain, Chris Jermaine, Vaibhav Unhelkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for solving challenging robotic tasks, even in the presence of action and observation uncertainties. Recent LLM-based decision-making methods (also referred to as LLM-based agents), when paired with appropriate critics, have demonstrated potential in solving complex, long-horizon tasks with relatively few interactions. However, most existing LLM-based agents lack the ability to retain and learn from past interactions - an essential trait of learning-based robotic systems. We propose RAG-Modulo, a framework that enhances LLM-based agents with a memory of past interactions and incorporates critics to evaluate the agents' decisions. The memory component allows the agent to automatically retrieve and incorporate relevant past experiences as in-context examples, providing context-aware feedback for more informed decision-making. Further by updating its memory, the agent improves its performance over time, thereby exhibiting learning. Through experiments in the challenging BabyAI and AlfWorld domains, we demonstrate significant improvements in task success rates and efficiency, showing that the proposed RAG-Modulo framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis, Vince Trencsenyi</p>
<p>Abstract: Game theory is a powerful framework for reasoning about strategic interactions, with applications in domains ranging from day-to-day life to international politics. However, applying formal reasoning tools in such contexts is challenging, as these scenarios are often expressed in natural language. To address this, we introduce a framework for the autoformalization of game-theoretic scenarios, which translates natural language descriptions into formal logic representations suitable for formal solvers. Our approach utilizes one-shot prompting and a solver that provides feedback on syntactic correctness to allow LLMs to refine the code. We evaluate the framework using GPT-4o and a dataset of natural language problem descriptions, achieving 98% syntactic correctness and 88% semantic correctness. These results show the potential of LLMs to bridge the gap between real-life strategic interactions and formal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghui Chen, Shufang Zhu, Giuseppe De Giacomo, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination in cooperative games is a crucial challenge in artificial intelligence, particularly when players operate under incomplete information. A common strategy to mitigate this information asymmetry involves leveraging explicit communication. However, direct communication is not always feasible due to factors such as transmission loss. We explore how effective coordination can be achieved without verbal communication, relying solely on observing each other's actions. We demonstrate how an autonomous agent can learn to cooperate by interpreting its partner's actions, which are used to hint at its intents. Our approach involves developing an agent strategy by constructing deterministic finite automata for each possible action and integrating them into a non-Markovian finite-state transducer. This transducer represents a non-deterministic strategy for the agent that suggests actions to assist its partner during gameplay. Experimental results in a testbed called Gnomes at Night show that the learned no-communication coordination strategy achieves significantly higher success rates and requires fewer steps to complete the game compared to uncoordinated scenarios, performing almost as well as an oracle baseline with direct communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Volker Tresp, Hang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The tensor brain has been introduced as a computational model for perception and memory. We provide an overview of the tensor brain model, including recent developments. The tensor brain has two major layers: the representation layer and the index layer. The representation layer is a model for the subsymbolic global workspace from consciousness research. The state of the representation layer is the cognitive brain state. The index layer contains symbols for concepts, time instances, and predicates. In a bottom-up operation, the cognitive brain state is encoded by the index layer as symbolic labels. In a top-down operation, symbols are decoded and written to the representation layer. This feeds to earlier processing layers as embodiment. The top-down operation became the basis for semantic memory. The embedding vector of a concept forms the connection weights between its index and the representation layer. The embedding is the signature or ``DNA'' of a concept, which is decoded by the brain when its index is activated. It integrates all that is known about a concept from different experiences, modalities, and symbolic decodings. Although being computational, it has been suggested that the tensor brain might be related to the actual operation of the brain. The sequential nature of symbol generation might have been a prerequisite to the generation of natural language. We describe an attention mechanism and discuss multitasking by multiplexing. We emphasize the inherent multimodality of the tensor brain. Finally, we discuss embedded and symbolic reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junnan Liu, Qianren Mao, Weifeng Jiang, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning plays a vital role in various applications and has garnered considerable attention. Recently, path-based methods have achieved impressive performance. However, they may face limitations stemming from constraints in message-passing neural networks, such as missing paths and information over-squashing. In this paper, we revisit the application of transformers for knowledge graph reasoning to address the constraints faced by path-based methods and propose a novel method KnowFormer.KnowFormer utilizes a transformer architecture to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs from the message-passing perspective, rather than reasoning by textual information like previous pretrained language model based methods. Specifically, we define the attention computation based on the query prototype of knowledge graph reasoning, facilitating convenient construction and efficient optimization. To incorporate structural information into the self-attention mechanism, we introduce structure-aware modules to calculate query, key, and value respectively. Additionally, we present an efficient attention computation method for better scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of KnowFormer compared to prominent baseline methods on both transductive and inductive benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12889">Can VLMs Play Action Role-Playing Games? Take Black Myth Wukong as a Study Case</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Chen, Pi Bu, Jun Song, Yuan Gao, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have made significant advances across various fields. One of the most popular research areas involves applying these agents to video games. Traditionally, these methods have relied on game APIs to access in-game environmental and action data. However, this approach is limited by the availability of APIs and does not reflect how humans play games. With the advent of vision language models (VLMs), agents now have enhanced visual understanding capabilities, enabling them to interact with games using only visual inputs. Despite these advances, current approaches still face challenges in action-oriented tasks, particularly in action role-playing games (ARPGs), where reinforcement learning methods are prevalent but suffer from poor generalization and require extensive training. To address these limitations, we select an ARPG, ``Black Myth: Wukong'', as a research platform to explore the capability boundaries of existing VLMs in scenarios requiring visual-only input and complex action output. We define 12 tasks within the game, with 75% focusing on combat, and incorporate several state-of-the-art VLMs into this benchmark. Additionally, we will release a human operation dataset containing recorded gameplay videos and operation logs, including mouse and keyboard actions. Moreover, we propose a novel VARP (Vision Action Role-Playing) agent framework, consisting of an action planning system and a visual trajectory system. Our framework demonstrates the ability to perform basic tasks and succeed in 90% of easy and medium-level combat scenarios. This research aims to provide new insights and directions for applying multimodal agents in complex action game environments. The code and datasets will be made available at https://varp-agent.github.io/.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12919">Swine Diet Design using Multi-objective Regionalized Bayesian Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel D. Uribe-Guerra, Danny A. M\'unera-Ram\'irez, Juli\'an D. Arias-Londo\~no</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of food diets in the context of animal nutrition is a complex problem that aims to develop cost-effective formulations while balancing minimum nutritional content. Traditional approaches based on theoretical models of metabolic responses and concentrations of digestible energy in raw materials face limitations in incorporating zootechnical or environmental variables affecting the performance of animals and including multiple objectives aligned with sustainable development policies. Recently, multi-objective Bayesian optimization has been proposed as a promising heuristic alternative able to deal with the combination of multiple sources of information, multiple and diverse objectives, and with an intrinsic capacity to deal with uncertainty in the measurements that could be related to variability in the nutritional content of raw materials. However, Bayesian optimization encounters difficulties in high-dimensional search spaces, leading to exploration predominantly at the boundaries. This work analyses a strategy to split the search space into regions that provide local candidates termed multi-objective regionalized Bayesian optimization as an alternative to improve the quality of the Pareto set and Pareto front approximation provided by BO in the context of swine diet design. Results indicate that this regionalized approach produces more diverse non-dominated solutions compared to the standard multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Besides, the regionalized strategy was four times more effective in finding solutions that outperform those identified by a stochastic programming approach referenced in the literature. Experiments using batches of query candidate solutions per iteration show that the optimization process can also be accelerated without compromising the quality of the Pareto set approximation during the initial, most critical phase of optimization.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12197">Nteasee: A mixed methods study of expert and general population perspectives on deploying AI for health in African countries</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mercy Nyamewaa Asiedu, Iskandar Haykel, Awa Dieng, Kerrie Kauer, Tousif Ahmed, Florence Ofori, Charisma Chan, Stephen Pfohl, Negar Rostamzadeh, Katherine Heller</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as explore opportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact in health. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadhith Shankarnarayanan, Dheeman Gangopadhyay, Ayman Alzaatreh</p>
<p>Abstract: The global surge in the cases of gastric cancer has prompted an investigation into the potential of gut microbiota as a predictive marker for the disease. The alterations in gut diversity are suspected to be associated with an elevated risk of gastric cancer. This paper delves into finding the correlation between gut microbiota and gastric cancer, focusing on patients who have undergone total and subtotal gastrectomy. Utilizing data mining and statistical learning methods, an analysis was conducted on 16S-RNA sequenced genes obtained from 96 participants with the aim of identifying specific genera of gut microbiota associated with gastric cancer. The study reveals several prominent bacterial genera that could potentially serve as biomarkers assessing the risk of gastric cancer. These findings offer a pathway for early risk assessment and precautionary measures in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The intricate mechanisms through which these gut microbiotas influence gastric cancer progression warrant further investigation. This research significantly aims to contribute to the growing understanding of the gut-cancer axis and its implications in disease prediction and prevention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manxi Sun, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Pengzhi Gao, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sparsely-Activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity for scaling up large language models (LLMs) without exploding computational costs. Despite its success, the current design faces a challenge where all experts have the same size, limiting the ability of tokens to choose the experts with the most appropriate size for generating the next token. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Diverse Size Experts (MoDSE), a new MoE architecture with layers designed to have experts of different sizes. Our analysis of difficult token generation tasks shows that experts of various sizes achieve better predictions, and the routing path of the experts tends to be stable after a training period. However, having experts of diverse sizes can lead to uneven workload distribution. To tackle this limitation, we introduce an expert-pair allocation strategy to evenly distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoDSE, as it outperforms existing MoEs by allocating the parameter budget to experts adaptively while maintaining the same total parameter size and the number of experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the wake of the swift evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), the global data landscape undergoes an exponential surge, propelling DNA storage into the spotlight as a prospective medium for contemporary cloud storage applications. This paper introduces a Semantic Artificial Intelligence-enhanced DNA storage (SemAI-DNA) paradigm, distinguishing itself from prevalent deep learning-based methodologies through two key modifications: 1) embedding a semantic extraction module at the encoding terminus, facilitating the meticulous encoding and storage of nuanced semantic information; 2) conceiving a forethoughtful multi-reads filtering model at the decoding terminus, leveraging the inherent multi-copy propensity of DNA molecules to bolster system fault tolerance, coupled with a strategically optimized decoder's architectural framework. Numerical results demonstrate the SemAI-DNA's efficacy, attaining 2.61 dB Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gain and 0.13 improvement in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) over conventional deep learning-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Characterizing materials with electron micrographs poses significant challenges for automated labeling due to the complex nature of nanomaterial structures. To address this, we introduce a fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that leverages recent advances in Generative AI. It is designed for analyzing and understanding the microstructures of semiconductor materials with effectiveness comparable to that of human experts, contributing to the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in nanomaterial identification. Our approach utilizes Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) such as GPT-4V, alongside text-to-image models like DALLE-3. We integrate a GPT-4 guided Visual Question Answering (VQA) method to analyze nanomaterial images, generate synthetic nanomaterial images via DALLE-3, and employ in-context learning with few-shot prompting in GPT-4V for accurate nanomaterial identification. Our method surpasses traditional techniques by enhancing the precision of nanomaterial identification and optimizing the process for high-throughput screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Wu, Yipeng Xu, Tianyu Xu, Jialu Zhang, Jianfeng Ren, Xudong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-Free Counting aims to count objects of interest without intensive annotations of objects or exemplars. To achieve this, we propose Gated Context-Aware Swin-UNet (GCA-SUN) to directly map an input image to the density map of countable objects. Specifically, a Gated Context-Aware Modulation module is designed in the encoder to suppress irrelevant objects or background through a gate mechanism and exploit the attentive support of objects of interest through a self-similarity matrix. The gate strategy is also incorporated into the bottleneck network and the decoder to highlight the features most relevant to objects of interest. By explicitly exploiting the attentive support among countable objects and eliminating irrelevant features through the gate mechanisms, the proposed GCA-SUN focuses on and counts objects of interest without relying on predefined categories or exemplars. Experimental results on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets demonstrate that GCA-SUN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's world of advanced AI technologies, data management is a critical component of any AI/ML solution. Effective data management is vital for the creation and maintenance of high-quality, diverse datasets, which significantly enhance predictive capabilities and lead to smarter business solutions. In this work, we introduce MetaPix, a Data-centric AI platform offering comprehensive data management solutions specifically designed for unstructured data. MetaPix offers robust tools for data ingestion, processing, storage, versioning, governance, and discovery. The platform operates on four key concepts: DataSources, Datasets, Extensions and Extractors. A DataSource serves as MetaPix top level asset, representing a narrow-scoped source of data for a specific use. Datasets are MetaPix second level object, structured collections of data. Extractors are internal tools integrated into MetaPix's backend processing, facilitate data processing and enhancement. Additionally, MetaPix supports extensions, enabling integration with external third-party tools to enhance platform functionality. This paper delves into each MetaPix concept in detail, illustrating how they collectively contribute to the platform's objectives. By providing a comprehensive solution for managing and utilizing unstructured computer vision data, MetaPix equips organizations with a powerful toolset to develop AI applications effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Ding, Cathy Y. Li, Shawn Shan, Ben Y. Zhao, Haitao Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works show that text-to-image generative models are surprisingly vulnerable to a variety of poisoning attacks. Empirical results find that these models can be corrupted by altering associations between individual text prompts and associated visual features. Furthermore, a number of concurrent poisoning attacks can induce "model implosion," where the model becomes unable to produce meaningful images for unpoisoned prompts. These intriguing findings highlight the absence of an intuitive framework to understand poisoning attacks on these models. In this work, we establish the first analytical framework on robustness of image generative models to poisoning attacks, by modeling and analyzing the behavior of the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models. We model cross-attention training as an abstract problem of "supervised graph alignment" and formally quantify the impact of training data by the hardness of alignment, measured by an Alignment Difficulty (AD) metric. The higher the AD, the harder the alignment. We prove that AD increases with the number of individual prompts (or concepts) poisoned. As AD grows, the alignment task becomes increasingly difficult, yielding highly distorted outcomes that frequently map meaningful text prompts to undefined or meaningless visual representations. As a result, the generative model implodes and outputs random, incoherent images at large. We validate our analytical framework through extensive experiments, and we confirm and explain the unexpected (and unexplained) effect of model implosion while producing new, unforeseen insights. Our work provides a useful tool for studying poisoning attacks against diffusion models and their defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting hepatic vessels from abdominal images is of high interest for clinicians since it allows to divide the liver into functionally-independent Couinaud segments. In this respect, an automated liver blood vessel extraction is widely summoned. Despite the significant growth in performance of semantic segmentation methodologies, preserving the complex multi-scale geometry of main vessels and ramifications remains a major challenge. This paper provides a new deep supervised approach for vessel segmentation, with a strong focus on representations arising from the different scales inherent to the vascular tree geometry. In particular, we propose a new clustering technique to decompose the tree into various scale levels, from tiny to large vessels. Then, we extend standard 3D UNet to multi-task learning by incorporating scale-specific auxiliary tasks and contrastive learning to encourage the discrimination between scales in the shared representation. Promising results, depicted in several evaluation metrics, are revealed on the public 3D-IRCADb dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Sadikine, Bogdan Badic, Enzo Ferrante, Vincent Noblet, Pascal Ballet, Dimitris Visvikis, Pierre-Henri Conze</p>
<p>Abstract: The precise delineation of blood vessels in medical images is critical for many clinical applications, including pathology detection and surgical planning. However, fully-automated vascular segmentation is challenging because of the variability in shape, size, and topology. Manual segmentation remains the gold standard but is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale studies. Hence, there is a need for automatic and reliable segmentation methods that can accurately detect blood vessels from medical images. The integration of shape and topological priors into vessel segmentation models has been shown to improve segmentation accuracy by offering contextual information about the shape of the blood vessels and their spatial relationships within the vascular tree. To further improve anatomical consistency, we propose a new joint prior encoding mechanism which incorporates both shape and topology in a single latent space. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the publicly available 3D-IRCADb dataset. More globally, the proposed approach holds promise in overcoming the challenges associated with automatic vessel delineation and has the potential to advance the field of deep priors encoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie He, Runyuan Bao, Yiru Cang, Jianjun Wei, Yang Zhang, Jiacheng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper delves into the challenges and advancements in the field of medical image segmentation, particularly focusing on breast cancer diagnosis. The authors propose a novel Transformer-based segmentation model that addresses the limitations of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, in accurately localizing and segmenting small lesions within breast cancer images. The model introduces an axial attention mechanism to enhance the computational efficiency and address the issue of global contextual information that is often overlooked by CNNs. Additionally, the paper discusses improvements tailored to the small dataset challenge, including the incorporation of relative position information and a gated axial attention mechanism to refine the model's focus on relevant features. The proposed model aims to significantly improve the segmentation accuracy of breast cancer images, offering a more efficient and effective tool for computer-aided diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syada Tasfia Rahman, Nishat Vasker, Amir Khabbab Ahammed, Mahamudul Hasan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study uses machine vision and drone technologies to propose a unique method for the diagnosis of cucumber disease in agriculture. The backbone of this research is a painstakingly curated dataset of hyperspectral photographs acquired under genuine field conditions. Unlike earlier datasets, this study included a wide variety of illness types, allowing for precise early-stage detection. The model achieves an excellent 87.5\% accuracy in distinguishing eight unique cucumber illnesses after considerable data augmentation. The incorporation of drone technology for high-resolution images improves disease evaluation. This development has enormous potential for improving crop management, lowering labor costs, and increasing agricultural productivity. This research, which automates disease detection, represents a significant step toward a more efficient and sustainable agricultural future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Su, Anu Vellore, Amy Chang, Raffaele Mura, Blaine Nelson, Paul Kassianik, Amin Karbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in society creates new information security challenges for developers, organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact contents of the source training datasets poses security and safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be tricked into divulging training data by using out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based decompositional method to extract news articles from two frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723 New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim sentence from 73 articles, and over 20% of verbatim sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning that they likely originate from the source training dataset. This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require careful consideration from model development to its end-use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haemin Park, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges related to communication efficiency and heterogeneity. To address these issues, we explore the potential of using low-rank updates. Our theoretical analysis reveals that client's loss exhibits a higher rank structure (gradients span higher rank subspace of Hessian) compared to the server's loss. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that constraining client-side optimization to a low-rank subspace could provide an implicit regularization effect. Consequently, we propose FedLoRU, a general low-rank update framework for federated learning. Our framework enforces low-rank client-side updates and accumulates these updates to form a higher-rank model. Additionally, variants of FedLoRU can adapt to environments with statistical and model heterogeneity by employing multiple or hierarchical low-rank updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedLoRU performs comparably to full-rank algorithms and exhibits robustness to heterogeneous and large numbers of clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbiao Pang, Anjing Hu, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Organizing interesting webpages into hot topics is one of key steps to understand the trends of multimodal web data. A state-of-the-art solution is firstly to organize webpages into a large volume of multi-granularity topic candidates; hot topics are further identified by estimating their interestingness. However, these topic candidates contain a large number of fragments of hot topics due to both the inefficient feature representations and the unsupervised topic generation. This paper proposes a bundling-refining approach to mine more complete hot topics from fragments. Concretely, the bundling step organizes the fragment topics into coarse topics; next, the refining step proposes a submodular-based method to refine coarse topics in a scalable approach. The propose unconventional method is simple, yet powerful by leveraging submodular optimization, our approach outperforms the traditional ranking methods which involve the careful design and complex steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art method (i.e., latent Poisson deconvolution Pang et al. (2016)) 20% accuracy and 10% one on two public data sets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bochao Liu, Jianghu Lu, Pengju Wang, Junjie Zhang, Dan Zeng, Zhenxing Qian, Shiming Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models can achieve high inference accuracy by extracting rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, but may pose the risk of data privacy leakage in practical deployment. In this paper, we present an effective teacher-student learning approach to train privacy-preserving deep learning models via differentially private data-free distillation. The main idea is generating synthetic data to learn a student that can mimic the ability of a teacher well-trained on private data. In the approach, a generator is first pretrained in a data-free manner by incorporating the teacher as a fixed discriminator. With the generator, massive synthetic data can be generated for model training without exposing data privacy. Then, the synthetic data is fed into the teacher to generate private labels. Towards this end, we propose a label differential privacy algorithm termed selective randomized response to protect the label information. Finally, a student is trained on the synthetic data with the supervision of private labels. In this way, both data privacy and label privacy are well protected in a unified framework, leading to privacy-preserving models. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Shiming Ge, Daichi Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world applications today like video surveillance and urban governance need to address the recognition of masked faces, where content replacement by diverse masks often brings in incomplete appearance and ambiguous representation, leading to a sharp drop in accuracy. Inspired by recent progress on amodal perception, we propose to migrate the mechanism of amodal completion for the task of masked face recognition with an end-to-end de-occlusion distillation framework, which consists of two modules. The \textit{de-occlusion} module applies a generative adversarial network to perform face completion, which recovers the content under the mask and eliminates appearance ambiguity. The \textit{distillation} module takes a pre-trained general face recognition model as the teacher and transfers its knowledge to train a student for completed faces using massive online synthesized face pairs. Especially, the teacher knowledge is represented with structural relations among instances in multiple orders, which serves as a posterior regularization to enable the adaptation. In this way, the knowledge can be fully distilled and transferred to identify masked faces. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chien-Chun Wang, Li-Wei Chen, Cheng-Kang Chou, Hung-Shin Lee, Berlin Chen, Hsin-Min Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems demonstrate impressive performance on matched domains, their performance often degrades when confronted with channel mismatch stemming from unseen recording environments and conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel channel-aware data simulation method for robust ASR training. Our method harnesses the synergistic power of channel-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first train a channel encoder capable of extracting embeddings from arbitrary audio. On top of this, channel embeddings are extracted using a minimal amount of target-domain data and used to guide a GAN-based speech synthesizer. This synthesizer generates speech that faithfully preserves the phonetic content of the input while mimicking the channel characteristics of the target domain. We evaluate our method on the challenging Hakka Across Taiwan (HAT) and Taiwanese Across Taiwan (TAT) corpora, achieving relative character error rate (CER) reductions of 20.02% and 9.64%, respectively, compared to the baselines. These results highlight the efficacy of our channel-aware data simulation method for bridging the gap between source- and target-domain acoustics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Kang, Lingwei Meng, Mingyu Cui, Yuejiao Wang, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-talker speech recognition (MTASR) faces unique challenges in disentangling and transcribing overlapping speech. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the role of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) in speaker disentanglement when incorporated with Serialized Output Training (SOT) for MTASR. Our visualization reveals that CTC guides the encoder to represent different speakers in distinct temporal regions of acoustic embeddings. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel Speaker-Aware CTC (SACTC) training objective, based on the Bayes risk CTC framework. SACTC is a tailored CTC variant for multi-talker scenarios, it explicitly models speaker disentanglement by constraining the encoder to represent different speakers' tokens at specific time frames. When integrated with SOT, the SOT-SACTC model consistently outperforms standard SOT-CTC across various degrees of speech overlap. Specifically, we observe relative word error rate reductions of 10% overall and 15% on low-overlap speech. This work represents an initial exploration of CTC-based enhancements for MTASR tasks, offering a new perspective on speaker disentanglement in multi-talker speech recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physical adversarial patches have emerged as a key adversarial attack to cause misclassification of traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems in the real world. However, existing adversarial patches have poor stealthiness and attack all vehicles indiscriminately once deployed. In this paper, we introduce an invisible and triggered physical adversarial patch (ITPatch) with a novel attack vector, i.e., fluorescent ink, to advance the state-of-the-art. It applies carefully designed fluorescent perturbations to a target sign, an attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially resulting in traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of ITPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) have shown that language model (LM)-based systems offer competitive performance to their counterparts. Further optimization can be achieved through preference alignment algorithms, which adjust LMs to align with the preferences of reward models, enhancing the desirability of the generated content. This study presents a thorough empirical evaluation of how preference alignment algorithms, particularly Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enhance LM-based TTS. With a 1.15B parameter LM-based TTS model, we demonstrate that preference alignment consistently improves intelligibility, speaker similarity, and proxy subjective evaluation scores, with the latter two metrics surpassing even human speech in certain evaluations. We also show preference alignment is applicable to low-resource scenarios and effectively generalized to out-of-domain applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Manual testing is vital for detecting issues missed by automated tests, but specifying accurate verifications is challenging. Aims: This study aims to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce verifications for manual tests. Method: We conducted two independent and complementary exploratory studies. The first study involved using 2 closed-source and 6 open-source LLMs to generate verifications for manual test steps and evaluate their similarity to original verifications. The second study involved recruiting software testing professionals to assess their perception and agreement with the generated verifications compared to the original ones. Results: The open-source models Mistral-7B and Phi-3-mini-4k demonstrated effectiveness and consistency comparable to closed-source models like Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-3.5-turbo in generating manual test verifications. However, the agreement level among professional testers was slightly above 40%, indicating both promise and room for improvement. While some LLM-generated verifications were considered better than the originals, there were also concerns about AI hallucinations, where verifications significantly deviated from expectations. Conclusion: We contributed by generating a dataset of 37,040 test verifications using 8 different LLMs. Although the models show potential, the relatively modest 40% agreement level highlights the need for further refinement. Enhancing the accuracy, relevance, and clarity of the generated verifications is crucial to ensure greater reliability in real-world testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, High Definition (HD) maps provide a complete lane model that is not limited by sensor range and occlusions. However, the generation and upkeep of HD maps involves periodic data collection and human annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we investigate automating the lane model generation and the use of sparse vehicle observations instead of dense sensor measurements. For our approach, a pre-processing step generates polylines by aligning and aggregating observed lane boundaries. Aligned driven traces are used as starting points for predicting lane pairs defined by the left and right boundary points. We propose Lane Model Transformer Network (LMT-Net), an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that performs polyline encoding and predicts lane pairs and their connectivity. A lane graph is formed by using predicted lane pairs as nodes and predicted lane connectivity as edges. We evaluate the performance of LMT-Net on an internal dataset that consists of multiple vehicle observations as well as human annotations as Ground Truth (GT). The evaluation shows promising results and demonstrates superior performance compared to the implemented baseline on both highway and non-highway Operational Design Domain (ODD).</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a multichannel-to-multichannel target sound extraction (M2M-TSE) framework for separating multichannel target signals from a multichannel mixture of sound sources. Target sound extraction (TSE) isolates a specific target signal using user-provided clues, typically focusing on single-channel extraction with class labels or temporal activation maps. However, to preserve and utilize spatial information in multichannel audio signals, it is essential to extract multichannel signals of a target sound source. Moreover, the clue for extraction can also include spatial or temporal cues like direction-of-arrival (DoA) or timestamps of source activation. To address these challenges, we present an M2M framework that extracts a multichannel sound signal based on spatio-temporal clues. We demonstrate that our transformer-based architecture can successively accomplish the M2M-TSE task for multichannel signals synthesized from audio signals of diverse classes in different room environments. Furthermore, we show that the multichannel extraction task introduces sufficient inductive bias in the DNN, allowing it to directly handle DoA clues without utilizing hand-crafted spatial features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Blessed Deho, Michael Bewong, Selasi Kwashie, Jiuyong Li, Jixue Liu, Lin Liu, Srecko Joksimovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the last few decades, machine learning (ML) applications have grown exponentially, yielding several benefits to society. However, these benefits are tempered with concerns of discriminatory behaviours exhibited by ML models. In this regard, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a priority research area. Consequently, several fairness metrics and algorithms have been developed to mitigate against discriminatory behaviours that ML models may possess. Yet still, very little attention has been paid to the problem of naturally occurring changes in data patterns (\textit{aka} data distributional drift), and its impact on fairness algorithms and metrics. In this work, we study this problem comprehensively by analyzing 4 fairness-unaware baseline algorithms and 7 fairness-aware algorithms, carefully curated to cover the breadth of its typology, across 5 datasets including public and proprietary data, and evaluated them using 3 predictive performance and 10 fairness metrics. In doing so, we show that (1) data distributional drift is not a trivial occurrence, and in several cases can lead to serious deterioration of fairness in so-called fair models; (2) contrary to some existing literature, the size and direction of data distributional drift is not correlated to the resulting size and direction of unfairness; and (3) choice of, and training of fairness algorithms is impacted by the effect of data distributional drift which is largely ignored in the literature. Emanating from our findings, we synthesize several policy implications of data distributional drift on fairness algorithms that can be very relevant to stakeholders and practitioners.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Cobweb4L, a novel approach for efficient language model learning that supports masked word prediction. The approach builds on Cobweb, an incremental system that learns a hierarchy of probabilistic concepts. Each concept stores the frequencies of words that appear in instances tagged with that concept label. The system utilizes an attribute value representation to encode words and their surrounding context into instances. Cobweb4L uses the information theoretic variant of category utility and a new performance mechanism that leverages multiple concepts to generate predictions. We demonstrate that with these extensions it significantly outperforms prior Cobweb performance mechanisms that use only a single node to generate predictions. Further, we demonstrate that Cobweb4L learns rapidly and achieves performance comparable to and even superior to Word2Vec. Next, we show that Cobweb4L and Word2Vec outperform BERT in the same task with less training data. Finally, we discuss future work to make our conclusions more robust and inclusive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Wang, Jie Zhang, Shihao Chen, Miao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Binaural speech enhancement (BSE) aims to jointly improve the speech quality and intelligibility of noisy signals received by hearing devices and preserve the spatial cues of the target for natural listening. Existing methods often suffer from the compromise between noise reduction (NR) capacity and spatial cues preservation (SCP) accuracy and a high computational demand in complex acoustic scenes. In this work, we present a learning-based lightweight binaural complex convolutional network (LBCCN), which excels in NR by filtering low-frequency bands and keeping the rest. Additionally, our approach explicitly incorporates the estimation of interchannel relative acoustic transfer function to ensure the spatial cues fidelity and speech clarity. Results show that the proposed LBCCN can achieve a comparable NR performance to state-of-the-art methods under various noise conditions, but with a much lower computational cost and a better SCP.

<p>Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d. data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number, and more. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d. sample of $\Theta(N^{\delta}\ln N)$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$, where $\delta\in (0,1)$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then with high probability, the MDL network fitted to this data accurately answers whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not, with test error $\leq O(N^{-\delta})$. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so.</p>

These prompts have powered AI experiences in popular software products, potentially reaching millions of users. Despite the growing impact of prompt-powered software, little is known about its development process and its relationship to programming. In this work, we argue that some forms of prompts are programs, and that the development of prompts is a distinct phenomenon in programming. We refer to this phenomenon as prompt programming. To this end, we develop an understanding of prompt programming using Straussian grounded theory through interviews with 20 developers engaged in prompt development across a variety of contexts, models, domains, and prompt complexities.
  Through this study, we contribute 14 observations about prompt programming. For example, rather than building mental models of code, prompt programmers develop mental models of the FM's behavior on the prompt and its unique qualities by interacting with the model. While prior research has shown that experts have well-formed mental models, we find that prompt programmers who have developed dozens of prompts, each with many iterations, still struggle to develop reliable mental models. This contributes to a rapid and unsystematic development process. Taken together, our observations indicate that prompt programming is significantly different from traditional software development, motivating the creation of tools to support prompt programming. Our findings have implications for software engineering practitioners, educators, and researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansoor Ali Teevno, Rafael Martinez-Garcia-Pena, Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz, Sharib Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Frequent monitoring is necessary to stratify individuals based on their likelihood of developing gastrointestinal (GI) cancer precursors. In clinical practice, white-light imaging (WLI) and complementary modalities such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) and fluorescence imaging are used to assess risk areas. However, conventional deep learning (DL) models show degraded performance due to the domain gap when a model is trained on one modality and tested on a different one. In our earlier approach, we used a superpixel-based method referred to as "SUPRA" to effectively learn domain-invariant information using color and space distances to generate groups of pixels. One of the main limitations of this earlier work is that the aggregation does not exploit structural information, making it suboptimal for segmentation tasks, especially for polyps and heterogeneous color distributions. Therefore, in this work, we propose an approach for style-content disentanglement using instance normalization and instance selective whitening (ISW) for improved domain generalization when combined with SUPRA. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: EndoUDA Barrett's Esophagus and EndoUDA polyps, and compare its performance with three state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our findings demonstrate a notable enhancement in performance compared to both baseline and SOTA methods across the target domain data. Specifically, our approach exhibited improvements of 14%, 10%, 8%, and 18% over the baseline and three SOTA methods on the polyp dataset. Additionally, it surpassed the second-best method (EndoUDA) on the Barrett's Esophagus dataset by nearly 2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enze Shi, Kui Zhao, Qilong Yuan, Jiaqi Wang, Huawen Hu, Sigang Yu, Shu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a vital tool to measure and record brain activity in neuroscience and clinical applications, yet its potential is constrained by signal heterogeneity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose FoME (Foundation Model for EEG), a novel approach using adaptive temporal-lateral attention scaling to address above-mentioned challenges. FoME is pre-trained on a diverse 1.7TB dataset of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings, comprising 745M parameters trained for 1,096k steps. Our model introduces two key innovations: a time-frequency fusion embedding technique and an adaptive time-lateral attention scaling (ATLAS) mechanism. These components synergistically capture complex temporal and spectral EEG dynamics, enabling FoME to adapt to varying patterns across diverse data streams and facilitate robust multi-channel modeling. Evaluations across four downstream tasks demonstrate FoME's superior performance in classification and forecasting applications, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results. To conclude, FoME establishes a new paradigm for EEG analysis, offering a versatile foundation that advances brain-computer interfaces, clinical diagnostics, and cognitive research across neuroscience and related fields.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Chen, Xingjian Luo, Jinlin Wu, Long Bai, Zhen Lei, Hongliang Ren, Sebastien Ourselin, Hongbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is critical for assisting surgeons in understanding surgical videos. Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwon Jung, Qin Liu, Tenghao Huang, Ben Zhou, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieval from external sources. However, it often struggles to filter out inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream task, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familiarity-aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Specifically, FaviComp proactively lowers the perplexity of the compressed evidence with regard to the target model by combining token probabilities from both the compression model and the target model to generate context that is more familiar to the target model. This approach balances the integration of parametric and non-parametric knowledge, which is especially helpful in complex tasks where the retrieved evidence set may not contain all the necessary information. Experimental results demonstrate that FaviComp consistently outperforms existing baselines in multiple open-domain QA datasets, achieving high compression rates and showcasing the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Liu, Dengpan Ye, Long Tang, Yunming Zhang, Jiacheng Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence, neural networks play a key role in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Despite the tremendous advantages, neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To improve the reliability of NIDS, many research has been conducted and plenty of solutions have been proposed. However, the existing solutions rarely consider the adversarial attacks against recurrent neural networks (RNN) with time steps, which would greatly affect the application of NIDS in real world. Therefore, we first propose a novel RNN adversarial attack model based on feature reconstruction called \textbf{T}emporal adversarial \textbf{E}xamples \textbf{A}ttack \textbf{M}odel \textbf{(TEAM)}, which applied to time series data and reveals the potential connection between adversarial and time steps in RNN. That is, the past adversarial examples within the same time steps can trigger further attacks on current or future original examples. Moreover, TEAM leverages Time Dilation (TD) to effectively mitigates the effect of temporal among adversarial examples within the same time steps. Experimental results show that in most attack categories, TEAM improves the misjudgment rate of NIDS on both black and white boxes, making the misjudgment rate reach more than 96.68%. Meanwhile, the maximum increase in the misjudgment rate of the NIDS for subsequent original samples exceeds 95.57%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0 contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper, we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model without explicit pitch bend modeling. Audio samples are available online: daewoung.github.io/ViolinDiff-Demo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeng-Lin Li, Ming-Ching Chang, Wei-Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for trustworthy AI in real-world applications. Leveraging recent advances in representation learning and latent embeddings, Various scoring algorithms estimate distributions beyond the training data. However, a single embedding space falls short in characterizing in-distribution data and defending against diverse OOD conditions. This paper introduces a novel Multi-Manifold Embedding Learning (MMEL) framework, optimizing hypersphere and hyperbolic spaces jointly for enhanced OOD detection. MMEL generates representative embeddings and employs a prototype-aware scoring function to differentiate OOD samples. It operates with very few OOD samples and requires no model retraining. Experiments on six open datasets demonstrate MMEL's significant reduction in FPR while maintaining a high AUC compared to state-of-the-art distance-based OOD detection methods. We analyze the effects of learning multiple manifolds and visualize OOD score distributions across datasets. Notably, enrolling ten OOD samples without retraining achieves comparable FPR and AUC to modern outlier exposure methods using 80 million outlier samples for model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Lv, Yuan Feng, Xike Xie, Xin Jia, Qirong Peng, Guiming Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei Nakagawa, Masanori Hirano, Kentaro Minami, Takanobu Mizuta</p>
<p>Abstract: The AI traders in financial markets have sparked significant interest in their effects on price formation mechanisms and market volatility, raising important questions for market stability and regulation. Despite this interest, a comprehensive model to quantitatively assess the specific impacts of AI traders remains undeveloped. This study aims to address this gap by modeling the influence of AI traders on market price formation and volatility within a multi-agent framework, leveraging the concept of microfoundations. Microfoundations involve understanding macroeconomic phenomena, such as market price formation, through the decision-making and interactions of individual economic agents. While widely acknowledged in macroeconomics, microfoundational approaches remain unexplored in empirical finance, particularly for models like the GARCH model, which captures key financial statistical properties such as volatility clustering and fat tails. This study proposes a multi-agent market model to derive the microfoundations of the GARCH model, incorporating three types of agents: noise traders, fundamental traders, and AI traders. By mathematically aggregating the micro-structure of these agents, we establish the microfoundations of the GARCH model. We validate this model through multi-agent simulations, confirming its ability to reproduce the stylized facts of financial markets. Finally, we analyze the impact of AI traders using parameters derived from these microfoundations, contributing to a deeper understanding of their role in market dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: We train, for the first time, large language models using FP8 precision on datasets up to 2 trillion tokens -- a 20-fold increase over previous limits. Through these extended training runs, we uncover critical instabilities in FP8 training that were not observable in earlier works with shorter durations. We trace these instabilities to outlier amplification by the SwiGLU activation function. Interestingly, we show, both analytically and empirically, that this amplification happens only over prolonged training periods, and link it to a SwiGLU weight alignment process. To address this newly identified issue, we introduce Smooth-SwiGLU, a novel modification that ensures stable FP8 training without altering function behavior. We also demonstrate, for the first time, FP8 quantization of both Adam optimizer moments. Combining these innovations, we successfully train a 7B parameter model using FP8 precision on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators, achieving on-par results with the BF16 baseline while delivering up to a $\sim 34 \%$ throughput improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Hi-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hi-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing long-term conversations, the increasing memory load as conversations progress degrades retrieval accuracy. Drawing on psychological insights, we propose LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment, participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over 4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user experience.

<p>Abstract: Developing novel interdisciplinary research ideas often requires discussions and feedback from experts across different domains. However, obtaining timely inputs is challenging due to the scarce availability of domain experts. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) research have suggested the feasibility of utilizing LLM-simulated expert personas to support research ideation. In this study, we introduce PersonaFlow, an LLM-based system using persona simulation to support the ideation stage of interdisciplinary scientific discovery. Our findings indicate that using multiple personas during ideation significantly enhances user-perceived quality of outcomes (e.g., relevance of critiques, creativity of research questions) without increasing cognitive load. We also found that users' persona customization interactions significantly improved their sense of control and recall of generated ideas. Based on the findings, we discuss highlighting ethical concerns, including potential over-reliance and cognitive biases, and suggest design implications for leveraging LLM-simulated expert personas to support research ideation when human expertise is inaccessible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled mechanical electrophysiological model with several free parameters that are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time. While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration in a bundle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masanari Kimura, Howard Bondell</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is known to contribute significantly to the robustness of machine learning models. In most instances, data augmentation is utilized during the training phase. Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) is a technique that instead leverages these data augmentations during the testing phase to achieve robust predictions. More precisely, TTA averages the predictions of multiple data augmentations of an instance to produce a final prediction. Although the effectiveness of TTA has been empirically reported, it can be expected that the predictive performance achieved will depend on the set of data augmentation methods used during testing. In particular, the data augmentation methods applied should make different contributions to performance. That is, it is anticipated that there may be differing degrees of contribution in the set of data augmentation methods used for TTA, and these could have a negative impact on prediction performance. In this study, we consider a weighted version of the TTA based on the contribution of each data augmentation. Some variants of TTA can be regarded as considering the problem of determining the appropriate weighting. We demonstrate that the determination of the coefficients of this weighted TTA can be formalized in a variational Bayesian framework. We also show that optimizing the weights to maximize the marginal log-likelihood suppresses candidates of unwanted data augmentations at the test phase.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agriculture, fundamental for human sustenance, faces unprecedented challenges. The need for efficient, human-cooperative, and sustainable farming methods has never been greater. The core contributions of this work involve leveraging Active Vision (AV) techniques and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) to improve the robot's ability to perceive and interact with agricultural environment in the context of fruit harvesting. The AV Pipeline implemented within ROS 2 integrates the Next-Best View (NBV) Planning for 3D environment reconstruction through a dynamic 3D Occupancy Map. Our system allows the robotics arm to dynamically plan and move to the most informative viewpoints and explore the environment, updating the 3D reconstruction using semantic information produced through ZSL models. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate our system's effectiveness in complex visibility conditions, outperforming traditional and static predefined planning methods. ZSL segmentation models employed, such as YOLO World + EfficientViT SAM, exhibit high-speed performance and accurate segmentation, allowing flexibility when dealing with semantic information in unknown agricultural contexts without requiring any fine-tuning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating "thought"-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaozhi Qian, Faroq Altam, Muhammad Saleh Saeed Alqurishi, Riad Souissi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the cornerstones of modern artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Juhaina, a Arabic-English bilingual LLM specifically designed to align with the values and preferences of Arabic speakers. Juhaina inherently supports advanced functionalities such as instruction following, open-ended question answering, information provisioning, and text processing. Our model contains 9.24 billion parameters and is trained on a context window of up to 8,192 tokens. This paper details the creation process of Juhaina and provides an extensive empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we identify the limitations of widely-adopted Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard (OALL) and propose a new evaluation benchmark, CamelEval. Our findings demonstrate that Juhaina surpasses existing LLMs of comparable sizes, such as the Llama and Gemma families, in generating helpful responses in Arabic, providing factually accurate information about the region, and understanding nuanced cultural aspects. We aspire for Juhaina to democratize cutting-edge AI technologies, serving over 400 million Arabic speakers by offering LLMs that not only communicate in their language but also comprehend their culture. We publicly release all models on Huggingface \url{https://huggingface.co/elmrc}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aurora Spagnol, Kacper Sokol, Pietro Barbiero, Marc Langheinrich, Martin Gjoreski</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering algorithms rely on complex optimisation processes that may be difficult to comprehend, especially for individuals who lack technical expertise. While many explainable artificial intelligence techniques exist for supervised machine learning, unsupervised learning -- and clustering in particular -- has been largely neglected. To complicate matters further, the notion of a ``true'' cluster is inherently challenging to define. These facets of unsupervised learning and its explainability make it difficult to foster trust in such methods and curtail their adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a new, model-agnostic technique for explaining clustering algorithms with counterfactual statements. Our approach relies on a novel soft-scoring method that captures the spatial information utilised by clustering models. It builds upon a state-of-the-art Bayesian counterfactual generator for supervised learning to deliver high-quality explanations. We evaluate its performance on five datasets and two clustering algorithms, and demonstrate that introducing soft scores to guide counterfactual search significantly improves the results.</p>

Extending these adversarial techniques to tabular ML presents unique challenges due to the distinct nature of tabular data and the necessity to preserve domain constraints in adversarial examples. In this paper, we adapt four popular tabular DGMs into adversarial DGMs (AdvDGMs) and evaluate their effectiveness in generating realistic adversarial examples that conform to domain constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mujadded Al Rabbani Alif</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of construction safety, the detection of personal protective equipment, such as helmets, plays a critical role in preventing workplace injuries. This paper details the development and evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for the accurate classification of helmet presence on construction sites. Initially, a simple CNN model comprising one convolutional block and one fully connected layer was developed, yielding modest results. To enhance its performance, the model was progressively refined, first by extending the architecture to include an additional convolutional block and a fully connected layer. Subsequently, batch normalization and dropout techniques were integrated, aiming to mitigate overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities. The performance of these models is methodically analyzed, revealing a peak F1-score of 84\%, precision of 82\%, and recall of 86\% with the most advanced configuration of the first study phase. Despite these improvements, the accuracy remained suboptimal, thus setting the stage for further architectural and operational enhancements. This work lays a foundational framework for ongoing adjustments and optimization in automated helmet detection technology, with future enhancements expected to address the limitations identified during these initial experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Khoi Duong, Stefan Conrad</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness metrics are used to assess discrimination and bias in decision-making processes across various domains, including machine learning models and human decision-makers in real-world applications. This involves calculating the disparities between probabilistic outcomes among social groups, such as acceptance rates between male and female applicants. However, traditional fairness metrics do not account for the uncertainty in these processes and lack of comparability when two decision-makers exhibit the same disparity. Using Bayesian statistics, we quantify the uncertainty of the disparity to enhance discrimination assessments. We represent each decision-maker, whether a machine learning model or a human, by its disparity and the corresponding uncertainty in that disparity. We define preferences over decision-makers and utilize brute-force to choose the optimal decision-maker according to a utility function that ranks decision-makers based on these preferences. The decision-maker with the highest utility score can be interpreted as the one for whom we are most certain that it is fair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiho Shin, Reem Aleithan, Hadi Hemmati, Song Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown notable advancements in software engineering tasks. Despite its potential, RAG's application in unit test generation remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we take the initiative to investigate the efficacy of RAG-based LLMs in test generation. As RAGs can leverage various knowledge sources to enhance their performance, we also explore the impact of different sources of RAGs' knowledge bases on unit test generation to provide insights into their practical benefits and limitations. Specifically, we examine RAG built upon three types of domain knowledge: 1) API documentation, 2) GitHub issues, and 3) StackOverflow Q&As. Each source offers essential knowledge for creating tests from different perspectives, i.e., API documentations provide official API usage guidelines, GitHub issues offer resolutions of issues related to the APIs from the library developers, and StackOverflow Q&As present community-driven solutions and best practices. For our experiment, we focus on five widely used and typical Python-based machine learning (ML) projects, i.e., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Google JAX, and XGBoost to build, train, and deploy complex neural networks efficiently. We conducted experiments using the top 10% most widely used APIs across these projects, involving a total of 188 APIs. We investigate the effectiveness of four state-of-the-art LLMs (open and closed-sourced), i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Mistral MoE 8x22B, and Llamma 3.1 405B. Additionally, we compare three prompting strategies in generating unit test cases for the experimental APIs, i.e., zero-shot, a Basic RAG, and an API-level RAG on the three external sources. Finally, we compare the cost of different sources of knowledge used for the RAG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite excellent results on benchmarks over a small subset of languages, large language models struggle to process text from languages situated in `lower-resource' scenarios such as dialects/sociolects (national or social varieties of a language), Creoles (languages arising from linguistic contact between multiple languages) and other low-resource languages. This introductory tutorial will identify common challenges, approaches, and themes in natural language processing (NLP) research for confronting and overcoming the obstacles inherent to data-poor contexts. By connecting past ideas to the present field, this tutorial aims to ignite collaboration and cross-pollination between researchers working in these scenarios. Our notion of `lower-resource' broadly denotes the outstanding lack of data required for model training - and may be applied to scenarios apart from the three covered in the tutorial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fouad Makiyeh, Mark Bastourous, Anass Bairouk, Wei Xiao, Mirjana Maras, Tsun-Hsuan Wangb, Marc Blanchon, Ramin Hasani, Patrick Chareyre, Daniela Rus</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation is a key challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring robust and accurate decision-making processes. This research introduces a new end-to-end method that exploits multimodal information from a single monocular camera to improve the steering predictions for self-driving cars. Unlike conventional models that require several sensors which can be costly and complex or rely exclusively on RGB images that may not be robust enough under different conditions, our model significantly improves vehicle steering prediction performance from a single visual sensor. By focusing on the fusion of RGB imagery with depth completion information or optical flow data, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates these modalities through both early and hybrid fusion techniques.
  We use three distinct neural network models to implement our approach: Convolution Neural Network - Neutral Circuit Policy (CNN-NCP) , Variational Auto Encoder - Long Short-Term Memory (VAE-LSTM) , and Neural Circuit Policy architecture VAE-NCP. By incorporating optical flow into the decision-making process, our method significantly advances autonomous navigation. Empirical results from our comparative study using Boston driving data show that our model, which integrates image and motion information, is robust and reliable. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that do not use optical flow, reducing the steering estimation error by 31%. This demonstrates the potential of optical flow data, combined with advanced neural network architectures (a CNN-based structure for fusing data and a Recurrence-based network for inferring a command from latent space), to enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles steering estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas P\"ollabauer, Ashwin Pramod, Volker Knauthe, Michael Wahl</p>
<p>Abstract: 6D object pose estimation involves determining the three-dimensional translation and rotation of an object within a scene and relative to a chosen coordinate system. This problem is of particular interest for many practical applications in industrial tasks such as quality control, bin picking, and robotic manipulation, where both speed and accuracy are critical for real-world deployment. Current models, both classical and deep-learning-based, often struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Our research focuses on enhancing the speed of a prominent state-of-the-art deep learning model, GDRNPP, while keeping its high accuracy. We employ several techniques to reduce the model size and improve inference time. These techniques include using smaller and quicker backbones, pruning unnecessary parameters, and distillation to transfer knowledge from a large, high-performing model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed configuration maintains accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art while significantly improving inference time. This advancement could lead to more efficient and practical applications in various industrial scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall applicability of 6D Object Pose Estimation models in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the security of cloud environments is imperative for sustaining organizational growth and operational efficiency. As the ubiquity of cloud services continues to rise, the inevitability of cyber threats underscores the importance of preemptive detection. This paper introduces a pioneering time-based embedding approach for Cloud Services Graph-based Anomaly Detection (CS-GAD), utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to discern anomalous user behavior during interactions with cloud services. Our method employs a dynamic tripartite graph representation to encapsulate the evolving interactions among cloud services, users, and their activities over time. Leveraging GNN models in each time frame, our approach generates a graph embedding wherein each user is assigned a score based on their historical activity, facilitating the identification of unusual behavior. Results demonstrate a notable reduction in false positive rates (2-9%) compared to prevailing methods, coupled with a commendable true positive rate (100%). The contributions of this work encompass early detection capabilities, a low false positive rate, an innovative tripartite graph representation incorporating action types, the introduction of a new cloud services dataset featuring various user attacks, and an open-source implementation for community collaboration in advancing cloud service security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weipu Chen, Zhuangzhuang He, Fei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning user preferences from implicit feedback is one of the core challenges in recommendation. The difficulty lies in the potential noise within implicit feedback. Therefore, various denoising recommendation methods have been proposed recently. However, most of them overly rely on the hyperparameter configurations, inevitably leading to inadequacies in model adaptability and generalization performance. In this study, we propose a novel Adaptive Ensemble Learning (AEL) for denoising recommendation, which employs a sparse gating network as a brain, selecting suitable experts to synthesize appropriate denoising capacities for different data samples. To address the ensemble learning shortcoming of model complexity and ensure sub-recommender diversity, we also proposed a novel method that stacks components to create sub-recommenders instead of directly constructing them. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that AEL outperforms others in kinds of popular metrics, even in the presence of substantial and dynamic noise.

We show that adding token-level objectives greatly improves the sentence representation quality across several tasks. Our approach outperforms current pre-trained cross-lingual sentence encoders on bi-text mining as well as several downstream tasks. We also analyse the information encoded in our tokens, and how the sentence representation is built from them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Chen, Lu Chi, Bingyue Peng, Zehuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, prompting several studies to explore their potential in recommendation systems. However, these attempts have so far resulted in only modest improvements over traditional recommendation models. Moreover, three critical questions remain under-explored: firstly, the real value of LLMs' pre-trained weights, often considered to encapsulate world knowledge; secondly, the necessity of fine-tuning for recommendation tasks; lastly, whether LLMs can exhibit the same scalability benefits in recommendation systems as they do in other domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Large Language Model (HLLM) architecture designed to enhance sequential recommendation systems. Our approach employs a two-tier model: the first Item LLM extracts rich content features from the detailed text description of the item, while the second User LLM utilizes these features to predict users' future interests based on their interaction history. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively leverages the pre-trained capabilities of open-source LLMs, and further fine-tuning leads to significant performance boosts. Additionally, HLLM achieves excellent scalability, with the largest configuration utilizing 7B parameters for both item feature extraction and user interest modeling. Moreover, HLLM offers excellent training and serving efficiency, making it practical in real-world applications. Evaluations on two large-scale datasets, PixelRec and Amazon Reviews, show that HLLM achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming traditional ID-based models by a wide margin. In online A/B testing, HLLM showcases notable gains, validating its practical impact in real-world recommendation scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) fine tuning is underutilized in the field of medicine. Two of the most common methods of fine tuning are Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Parameter Optimization (DPO), but there is little guidance informing users when to use either technique. In this investigation, we compare the performance of SFT and DPO for five common natural language tasks in medicine: Classification with text data, Classification with numeric data, Clinical Reasoning, Summarization, and Clinical Triage. We find that SFT alone is sufficient for Classification with text data, whereas DPO improves performance for the more complex tasks of Clinical Reasoning, Summarization and Clinical Triage. Our results establish the role and importance of DPO fine tuning within medicine, and consequently call attention to current software gaps that prevent widespread deployment of this technique.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of synthetic speech as data augmentation is gaining increasing popularity in fields such as automatic speech recognition and speech classification tasks. Despite novel text-to-speech systems with voice cloning capabilities, that allow the usage of a larger amount of voices based on short audio segments, it is known that these systems tend to hallucinate and oftentimes produce bad data that will most likely have a negative impact on the downstream task. In the present work, we conduct a set of experiments around zero-shot learning with synthetic speech data for the specific task of speech commands classification. Our results on the Google Speech Commands dataset show that a simple ASR-based filtering method can have a big impact in the quality of the generated data, translating to a better performance. Furthermore, despite the good quality of the generated speech data, we also show that synthetic and real speech can still be easily distinguishable when using self-supervised (WavLM) features, an aspect further explored with a CycleGAN to bridge the gap between the two types of speech material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh V. Nguyen, Liang Zhao, Bobin Deng, William Severa, Honghui Xu, Shaoen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently gained significant interest in on-chip learning in embedded devices and emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, to extend SNNs to a Federated Learning (FL) setting involving collaborative model training, the communication between the local devices and the remote server remains the bottleneck, which is often restricted and costly. In this paper, we first explore the inherent robustness of SNNs under noisy communication in FL. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel Federated Learning with Top-K Sparsification (FLTS) algorithm to reduce the bandwidth usage for FL training. We discover that the proposed scheme with SNNs allows more bandwidth savings compared to ANNs without impacting the model's accuracy. Additionally, the number of parameters to be communicated can be reduced to as low as 6 percent of the size of the original model. We further improve the communication efficiency by enabling dynamic parameter compression during model training. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the baselines in terms of communication cost and model accuracy and are promising for practical network-efficient FL with SNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyue Zhang, Zhiliu Yang, Xinhe Zuo, Yuxin Tong, Ying Long, Chen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale scene reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and aims to address the scalability and accuracy challenges faced by existing methods. For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction. We further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach by rendering on self-collected video clips recorded by a commercial drone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsun Lim, Hojun Choi, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Xie, Zhuo Yang, Chun-Chun Hu, Haw-Ching Yang, Yan Lu, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an emerging metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology that enables rapid fabrication of complex geometries. However, defects such as pores and balling may occur and lead to structural unconformities, thus compromising the mechanical performance of the part. This has become a critical challenge for quality assurance as the nature of some defects is stochastic during the process and invisible from the exterior. To address this issue, digital twin (DT) using machine learning (ML)-based modeling can be deployed for AM process monitoring and control. Melt pool is one of the most commonly observed physical phenomena for process monitoring, usually by high-speed cameras. Once labeled and preprocessed, the melt pool images are used to train ML-based models for DT applications such as process anomaly detection and print quality evaluation. Nonetheless, the reusability of DTs is restricted due to the wide variability of AM settings, including AM machines and monitoring instruments. The performance of the ML models trained using the dataset collected from one setting is usually compromised when applied to other settings. This paper proposes a knowledge transfer pipeline between different AM settings to enhance the reusability of AM DTs. The source and target datasets are collected from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Cheng Kung University with different cameras, materials, AM machines, and process parameters. The proposed pipeline consists of four steps: data preprocessing, data augmentation, domain alignment, and decision alignment. Compared with the model trained only using the source dataset, this pipeline increased the melt pool anomaly detection accuracy by 31% without any labeled training data from the target dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Pignatelli, Johan Ferret, Tim Rock\"aschel, Edward Grefenstette, Davide Paglieri, Samuel Coward, Laura Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: The temporal credit assignment problem is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL), concerned with attributing the appropriate influence to each actions in a trajectory for their ability to achieve a goal. However, when feedback is delayed and sparse, the learning signal is poor, and action evaluation becomes harder. Canonical solutions, such as reward shaping and options, require extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, limiting their scalability and applicability. In this work, we lay the foundations for Credit Assignment with Language Models (CALM), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate credit assignment via reward shaping and options discovery. CALM uses LLMs to decompose a task into elementary subgoals and assess the achievement of these subgoals in state-action transitions. Every time an option terminates, a subgoal is achieved, and CALM provides an auxiliary reward. This additional reward signal can enhance the learning process when the task reward is sparse and delayed without the need for human-designed rewards. We provide a preliminary evaluation of CALM using a dataset of human-annotated demonstrations from MiniHack, suggesting that LLMs can be effective in assigning credit in zero-shot settings, without examples or LLM fine-tuning. Our preliminary results indicate that the knowledge of LLMs is a promising prior for credit assignment in RL, facilitating the transfer of human knowledge into value functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Mecke, Daniel Buschek, Uwe Gruenefeld, Florian Alt</p>
<p>Abstract: Many important decisions in our everyday lives, such as authentication via biometric models, are made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. These can be in poor alignment with human expectations, and testing them on clear-cut existing data may not be enough to uncover those cases. We propose a method to find samples in the latent space of a generative model, designed to be challenging for a decision-making model with regard to matching human expectations. By presenting those samples to both the decision-making model and human raters, we can identify areas where its decisions align with human intuition and where they contradict it. We apply this method to a face recognition model and collect a dataset of 11,200 human ratings from 100 participants. We discuss findings from our dataset and how our approach can be used to explore the performance of AI models in different contexts and for different user groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Spitzer, Joshua Holstein, Katelyn Morrison, Kenneth Holstein, Gerhard Satzger, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Across various applications, humans increasingly use black-box artificial intelligence (AI) systems without insight into these systems' reasoning. To counter this opacity, explainable AI (XAI) methods promise enhanced transparency and interpretability. While recent studies have explored how XAI affects human-AI collaboration, few have examined the potential pitfalls caused by incorrect explanations. The implications for humans can be far-reaching but have not been explored extensively. To investigate this, we ran a study (n=160) on AI-assisted decision-making in which humans were supported by XAI. Our findings reveal a misinformation effect when incorrect explanations accompany correct AI advice with implications post-collaboration. This effect causes humans to infer flawed reasoning strategies, hindering task execution and demonstrating impaired procedural knowledge. Additionally, incorrect explanations compromise human-AI team-performance during collaboration. With our work, we contribute to HCI by providing empirical evidence for the negative consequences of incorrect explanations on humans post-collaboration and outlining guidelines for designers of AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Fang, Jiaqi Liu, Mingyu Ding, Yiming Cui, Chen Lv, Chen Lv, Chen Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: At present, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have begun to open road testing around the world, but their safety and efficiency performance in complex scenarios is still not satisfactory. Cooperative driving leverages the connectivity ability of CAVs to achieve synergies greater than the sum of their parts, making it a promising approach to improving CAV performance in complex scenarios. However, the lack of interaction and continuous learning ability limits current cooperative driving to single-scenario applications and specific Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA). To address these challenges, this paper proposes CoDrivingLLM, an interactive and learnable LLM-driven cooperative driving framework, to achieve all-scenario and all-CDA. First, since Large Language Models(LLMs) are not adept at handling mathematical calculations, an environment module is introduced to update vehicle positions based on semantic decisions, thus avoiding potential errors from direct LLM control of vehicle positions. Second, based on the four levels of CDA defined by the SAE J3216 standard, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (COT) based reasoning module that includes state perception, intent sharing, negotiation, and decision-making, enhancing the stability of LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks. Centralized conflict resolution is then managed through a conflict coordinator in the reasoning process. Finally, by introducing a memory module and employing retrieval-augmented generation, CAVs are endowed with the ability to learn from their past experiences. We validate the proposed CoDrivingLLM through ablation experiments on the negotiation module, reasoning with different shots experience, and comparison with other cooperative driving methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many climate processes are characterized using large systems of nonlinear differential equations; this, along with the immense amount of data required to parameterize complex interactions, means that Earth-System Model (ESM) simulations may take weeks to run on large clusters. Uncertainty quantification may require thousands of runs, making ESM simulations impractical for preliminary assessment. Alternatives may include simplifying the processes in the model, but recent efforts have focused on using machine learning to complement these models or even act as full surrogates. \textit{We leverage machine learning, specifically fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs), to enable rapid simulation and uncertainty quantification in order to inform more extensive ESM simulations.} Our surrogate simulated 80 years in approximately 310 seconds on a single A100 GPU, compared to weeks for the ESM model while having mean temperature errors below $0.1^{\circ}C$ and maximum errors below $2^{\circ}C$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. We experimentally demonstrate this new approach, reaching an improvement in the relevant figure of merit by a factor of up to 5. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Flavor development in the food industry is increasingly challenged by the need for rapid innovation and precise flavor profile creation. Traditional flavor research methods typically rely on iterative, subjective testing, which lacks the efficiency and scalability required for modern demands. This paper presents three contributions to address the challenges. Firstly, we define a new problem domain for scientific agents in flavor science, conceptualized as the generation of hypotheses for flavor profile sourcing and understanding. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce the FoodPuzzle, a challenging benchmark consisting of 978 food items and 1,766 flavor molecules profiles. We propose a novel Scientific Agent approach, integrating in-context learning and retrieval augmented techniques to generate grounded hypotheses in the domain of food science. Experimental results indicate that our model significantly surpasses traditional methods in flavor profile prediction tasks, demonstrating its potential to transform flavor development practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David DeFazio, Hrudayangam Mehta, Jeremy Blackburn, Shiqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can simultaneously reason about images and texts to tackle many tasks, from visual question answering to image captioning. This paper focuses on map parsing, a novel task that is unexplored within the VLM context and particularly useful to mobile robots. Map parsing requires understanding not only the labels but also the geometric configurations of a map, i.e., what areas are like and how they are connected. To evaluate the performance of VLMs on map parsing, we prompt VLMs with floorplan maps to generate task plans for complex indoor navigation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable capability of VLMs in map parsing, with a success rate of 0.96 in tasks requiring a sequence of nine navigation actions, e.g., approaching and going through doors. Other than intuitive observations, e.g., VLMs do better in smaller maps and simpler navigation tasks, there was a very interesting observation that its performance drops in large open areas. We provide practical suggestions to address such challenges as validated by our experimental results. Webpage: https://shorturl.at/OUkEY</p>

<p>Abstract: E-commerce stores enable multilingual product discovery which require accurate product title translation. Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capacity to perform machine translation tasks, and it can also enhance and translate product titles cross-lingually in one step. However, product title translation often requires more than just language conversion because titles are short, lack context, and contain specialized terminology. This study proposes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that leverages existing bilingual product information in e-commerce by retrieving similar bilingual examples and incorporating them as few-shot prompts to enhance LLM-based product title translation. Experiment results show that our proposed RAG approach improve product title translation quality with chrF score gains of up to 15.3% for language pairs where the LLM has limited proficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Flores-Araiza, Francisco Lopez-Tiro, Cl\'ement Larose, Salvador Hinojosa, Andres Mendez-Vazquez, Miguel Gonzalez-Mendoza, Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz, Christian Daul</p>
<p>Abstract: The in-vivo identification of the kidney stone types during an ureteroscopy would be a major medical advance in urology, as it could reduce the time of the tedious renal calculi extraction process, while diminishing infection risks. Furthermore, such an automated procedure would make possible to prescribe anti-recurrence treatments immediately. Nowadays, only few experienced urologists are able to recognize the kidney stone types in the images of the videos displayed on a screen during the endoscopy. Thus, several deep learning (DL) models have recently been proposed to automatically recognize the kidney stone types using ureteroscopic images. However, these DL models are of black box nature whicl limits their applicability in clinical settings. This contribution proposes a case-based reasoning DL model which uses prototypical parts (PPs) and generates local and global descriptors. The PPs encode for each class (i.e., kidney stone type) visual feature information (hue, saturation, intensity and textures) similar to that used by biologists. The PPs are optimally generated due a new loss function used during the model training. Moreover, the local and global descriptors of PPs allow to explain the decisions ("what" information, "where in the images") in an understandable way for biologists and urologists. The proposed DL model has been tested on a database including images of the six most widespread kidney stone types. The overall average classification accuracy was 90.37. When comparing this results with that of the eight other DL models of the kidney stone state-of-the-art, it can be seen that the valuable gain in explanability was not reached at the expense of accuracy which was even slightly increased with respect to that (88.2) of the best method of the literature. These promising and interpretable results also encourage urologists to put their trust in AI-based solutions.</p>

Traditional methods for monitoring are often time-consuming, expensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for large-scale applications, highlighting the need for accurate and efficient automated systems. In this study, we evaluate several state-of-the-art CNN models, including ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and a combined approach, to classify eleven harmful phytoplankton genera from microscopic images. The best performance was achieved by ResNet-50 using the fine-tuning approach, with an accuracy of 96.97%. The results also revealed that the models struggled to differentiate between four harmful phytoplankton types with similar morphological features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Samragh, Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh Vahid, Fartash Faghri, Minsik Cho, Moin Nabi, Devang Naik, Mehrdad Farajtabar</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-training phase of language models often begins with randomly initialized parameters. With the current trends in scaling models, training their large number of parameters can be extremely slow and costly. In contrast, small language models are less expensive to train, but they often cannot achieve the accuracy of large models. In this paper, we explore an intriguing idea to connect these two different regimes: Can we develop a method to initialize large language models using smaller pre-trained models? Will such initialization bring any benefits in terms of training time and final accuracy? In this paper, we introduce HyperCloning, a method that can expand the parameters of a pre-trained language model to those of a larger model with increased hidden dimensions. Our method ensures that the larger model retains the functionality of the smaller model. As a result, the larger model already inherits the predictive power and accuracy of the smaller model before the training starts. We demonstrate that training such an initialized model results in significant savings in terms of GPU hours required for pre-training large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Newman-Griffis</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The AI Thinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI use, and to reshape the future of AI in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Activity cliffs, which refer to pairs of molecules that are structurally similar but show significant differences in their potency, can lead to model representation collapse and make the model challenging to distinguish them. Our research indicates that as molecular similarity increases, graph-based methods struggle to capture these nuances, whereas image-based approaches effectively retain the distinctions. Thus, we developed MaskMol, a knowledge-guided molecular image self-supervised learning framework. MaskMol accurately learns the representation of molecular images by considering multiple levels of molecular knowledge, such as atoms, bonds, and substructures. By utilizing pixel masking tasks, MaskMol extracts fine-grained information from molecular images, overcoming the limitations of existing deep learning models in identifying subtle structural changes. Experimental results demonstrate MaskMol's high accuracy and transferability in activity cliff estimation and compound potency prediction across 20 different macromolecular targets, outperforming 25 state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning approaches. Visualization analyses reveal MaskMol's high biological interpretability in identifying activity cliff-relevant molecular substructures. Notably, through MaskMol, we identified candidate EP4 inhibitors that could be used to treat tumors. This study not only raises awareness about activity cliffs but also introduces a novel method for molecular image representation learning and virtual screening, advancing drug discovery and providing new insights into structure-activity relationships (SAR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This paper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process, examining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors in the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is innately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1, 1, \cdots, 1]^T \in \mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step in LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component of a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and (iii) scale the resultant vector by $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the representation space. We also introduce the property of "irreversibility" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during the normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch normalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present possible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the choice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the original authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the hidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using RMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to the uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the component along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our findings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more computationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also learns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal to the uniform vector.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing vision-language understanding benchmarks largely consist of images of objects in their usual contexts. As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) by aligning them with human preferences across diverse tasks. Traditional approaches to create instruction tuning datasets face serious challenges for low-resource languages due to their dependence on data annotation. This work introduces a novel method, Multilingual Reverse Instructions (MURI), which generates high-quality instruction tuning datasets for low-resource languages without requiring human annotators or pre-existing multilingual models. Utilizing reverse instructions and a translation pipeline, MURI produces instruction-output pairs from existing human-written texts in low-resource languages. This method ensures cultural relevance and diversity by sourcing texts from different native domains and applying filters to eliminate inappropriate content. Our dataset, MURI-IT, includes more than 2 million instruction-output pairs across 200 languages. Evaluation by native speakers and fine-tuning experiments with mT5 models demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for both NLU and open-ended generation.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12959">MMSearch: Benchmarking the Potential of Large Models as Multi-modal Search Engines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongzhi Jiang, Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Yanmin Wu, Jiayi Lei, Pengshuo Qiu, Pan Lu, Zehui Chen, Guanglu Song, Peng Gao, Yu Liu, Chunyuan Li, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine. Project Page: https://mmsearch.github.io</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12963">Interpolating Video-LLMs: Toward Longer-sequence LMMs in a Training-free Manner</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Bingxin Xu, Weitai Kang, Mu Cai, Yuheng Li, Zehao Wen, Zhen Dong, Kurt Keutzer, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibakar Das, Vikram Seshasai, Vineet Sudhir Bhat, Pushkal Juneja, Jyotsna Bapat, Debabrata Das</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-intrusive system failure prediction technique using available information from developers and minimal information from raw logs (rather than mining entire logs) but keeping the data entirely private with the data owners. A neural network based multi-class classifier is developed for failure prediction, using artificially generated anonymous data set, applying a combination of techniques, viz., genetic algorithm (steps), pattern repetition, etc., to train and test the network. The proposed mechanism completely decouples the data set used for training process from the actual data which is kept private. Moreover, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) schemes are used to prioritize failures meeting business requirements. Results show high accuracy in failure prediction under different parameter configurations. On a broader context, any classification problem, beyond failure prediction, can be performed using the proposed mechanism with artificially generated data set without looking into the actual data as long as the input features can be translated to binary values (e.g. output from private binary classifiers) and can provide classification-as-a-service.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arne Bewersdorff, Christian Hartmann, Marie Hornberger, Kathrin Se{\ss}ler, Maria Bannert, Enkelejda Kasneci, Gjergji Kasneci, Xiaoming Zhai, Claudia Nerdel</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education. Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and feedback. These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness. Besides many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future implications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the transformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Thagard</p>
<p>Abstract: Explanatory inference is the creation and evaluation of hypotheses that provide explanations, and is sometimes known as abduction or abductive inference. Generative AI is a new set of artificial intelligence models based on novel algorithms for generating text, images, and sounds. This paper proposes a set of benchmarks for assessing the ability of AI programs to perform explanatory inference, and uses them to determine the extent to which ChatGPT, a leading generative AI model, is capable of making explanatory inferences. Tests on the benchmarks reveal that ChatGPT performs creative and evaluative inferences in many domains, although it is limited to verbal and visual modalities. Claims that ChatGPT and similar models are incapable of explanation, understanding, causal reasoning, meaning, and creativity are rebutted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeff Shrager</p>
<p>Abstract: ELIZA, often considered the world's first chatbot, was written by Joseph Weizenbaum in the early 1960s. Weizenbaum did not intend to invent the chatbot, but rather to build a platform for research into human-machine conversation and the important cognitive processes of interpretation and misinterpretation. His purpose was obscured by ELIZA's fame, resulting in large part from the fortuitous timing of it's creation, and it's escape into the wild. In this paper I provide a rich historical context for ELIZA's creation, demonstrating that ELIZA arose from the intersection of some of the central threads in the technical history of AI. I also briefly discuss how ELIZA escaped into the world, and how its accidental escape, along with several coincidental turns of the programming language screws, led both to the misapprehension that ELIZA was intended as a chatbot, and to the loss of the original ELIZA to history for over 50 years.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rujia Shen, Yaoxion Lin, Liangliang Liu, Boran Wang, Yi Guan, Yang Yang, Jingchi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is immensely important in extensive applications, such as electricity transformation, medical monitoring, and smart agriculture. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to handle time series data and achieved superior performances, their ability to predict long-term time series is limited due to overlooking intra- and inter-variable variations in the frequency domain. To address this problem, we propose the FreqBlock, where we obtain frequency representations through the Frequency Transform Module. Subsequently, inspired by the inherent Kramer-Kronig relations (KKRs) in the frequency domain, the Frequency Cross Attention between the real and imaginary parts is designed to obtian enhanced frequency representations and capture intra-variable variations. And then we use inception blocks to mix information to capture correlations between variables. Our backbone network, FreqTSF, adopts a residual structure by concatenating multiple FreqBlocks to avoid degradation problems. On a theoretical level, we demonstrate that the proposed two modules can significantly reduce the time and memory complexity from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for each FreqBlock computation. Empirical studies on three benchmark datasets show that FreqTSF achieves an overall relative MSE reduction of 15\% and an overall relative MAE reduction of 11\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiliang Chen, Sepehr Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongbo Kong, Kyunghun Kim, Suk-Ju Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have demonstrated remarkable success due to their class-wise controllability and superior quality for complex generation tasks. Typical cGANs solve the joint distribution matching problem by decomposing two easier sub-problems: marginal matching and conditional matching. In this paper, we proposes a simple but effective training methodology, selective focusing learning, which enforces the discriminator and generator to learn easy samples of each class rapidly while maintaining diversity. Our key idea is to selectively apply conditional and joint matching for the data in each mini-batch.Specifically, we first select the samples with the highest scores when sorted using the conditional term of the discriminator outputs (real and generated samples). Then we optimize the model using the selected samples with only conditional matching and the other samples with joint matching. From our toy experiments, we found that it is the best to apply only conditional matching to certain samples due to the content-aware optimization of the discriminator. We conducted experiments on ImageNet (64x64 and 128x128), CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 datasets, and Mixture of Gaussian, noisy label settings to demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially (up to 35.18% in terms of FID) improve all indicators with 10 independent trials.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gandharv Patil, Prashanth L. A., Dheeraj Nagaraj, Doina Precup</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the finite-time behaviour of the popular temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm when combined with tail-averaging. We derive finite time bounds on the parameter error of the tail-averaged TD iterate under a step-size choice that does not require information about the eigenvalues of the matrix underlying the projected TD fixed point. Our analysis shows that tail-averaged TD converges at the optimal $O\left(1/t\right)$ rate, both in expectation and with high probability. In addition, our bounds exhibit a sharper rate of decay for the initial error (bias), which is an improvement over averaging all iterates. We also propose and analyse a variant of TD that incorporates regularisation. From analysis, we conclude that the regularised version of TD is useful for problems with ill-conditioned features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchong Zhang, Changfeng Sun, Haoliang Han, Hongbin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that object detection networks are usually vulnerable to adversarial examples. Generally, adversarial attacks for object detection can be categorized into targeted and untargeted attacks. Compared with untargeted attacks, targeted attacks present greater challenges and all existing targeted attack methods launch the attack by misleading detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, since these methods must depend on the presence of the detected objects within the victim image, they suffer from limitations in attack scenarios and attack success rates. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature space attack method that can mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra designated objects regardless of whether the victim image contains objects or not. Specifically, we introduce a guided image to extract coarse-grained features of the target objects and design an innovative dual attention mechanism to filter out the critical features of the target objects efficiently. The attack performance of the proposed method is evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets with FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed targeted feature space attack method shows significant improvements in terms of image-specific, universality, and generalization attack performance, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renrui Zhang, Jiaming Han, Chris Liu, Peng Gao, Aojun Zhou, Xiangfei Hu, Shilin Yan, Pan Lu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

<p>Abstract: We present a neural network-based simulation super-resolution framework that can efficiently and realistically enhance a facial performance produced by a low-cost, realtime physics-based simulation to a level of detail that closely approximates that of a reference-quality off-line simulator with much higher resolution (26x element count in our examples) and accurate physical modeling. Our approach is rooted in our ability to construct - via simulation - a training set of paired frames, from the low- and high-resolution simulators respectively, that are in semantic correspondence with each other. We use face animation as an exemplar of such a simulation domain, where creating this semantic congruence is achieved by simply dialing in the same muscle actuation controls and skeletal pose in the two simulators. Our proposed neural network super-resolution framework generalizes from this training set to unseen expressions, compensates for modeling discrepancies between the two simulations due to limited resolution or cost-cutting approximations in the real-time variant, and does not require any semantic descriptors or parameters to be provided as input, other than the result of the real-time simulation. We evaluate the efficacy of our pipeline on a variety of expressive performances and provide comparisons and ablation experiments for plausible variations and alternatives to our proposed scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swastika Roy, Hatim Chergui, Christos Verikoukis</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of sixth-generation (6G) networks, where diverse network slices coexist, the adoption of AI-driven zero-touch management and orchestration (MANO) becomes crucial. However, ensuring the trustworthiness of AI black-boxes in real deployments is challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) tools can play a vital role in establishing transparency among the stakeholders in the slicing ecosystem. But there is a trade-off between AI performance and explainability, posing a dilemma for trustworthy 6G network slicing because the stakeholders require both highly performing AI models for efficient resource allocation and explainable decision-making to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance. To balance this trade off and inspired by the closed loop automation and XAI methodologies, this paper presents a novel explanation-guided in-hoc federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an explainer exchange -- in a closed loop (CL) fashion -- soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent 6G network slicing resource management in a RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets. In particular, we quantitatively validate the faithfulness of the explanations via the so-called attribution-based confidence metric that is included as a constraint to guide the overall training process in the run-time FL optimization task. In this respect, Integrated-Gradient (IG) as well as Input $\times$ Gradient and SHAP are used to generate the attributions for our proposed in-hoc scheme, wherefore simulation results under different methods confirm its success in tackling the performance-explainability trade-off and its superiority over the unconstrained Integrated-Gradient post-hoc FL baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Philipp Klein, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: A clear need for automatic anomaly detection applied to automotive testing has emerged as more and more attention is paid to the data recorded and manual evaluation by humans reaches its capacity. Such real-world data is massive, diverse, multivariate and temporal in nature, therefore requiring modelling of the testee behaviour. We propose a variational autoencoder with multi-head attention (MA-VAE), which, when trained on unlabelled data, not only provides very few false positives but also manages to detect the majority of the anomalies presented. In addition to that, the approach offers a novel way to avoid the bypass phenomenon, an undesirable behaviour investigated in literature. Lastly, the approach also introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. The results are presented in the context of a real-world industrial data set and several experiments are undertaken to further investigate certain aspects of the proposed model. When configured properly, it is 9% of the time wrong when an anomaly is flagged and discovers 67% of the anomalies present. Also, MA-VAE has the potential to perform well with only a fraction of the training and validation subset, however, to extract it, a more sophisticated threshold estimation method is required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikun Li, Mohamed Soliman, Paris Avgeriou</p>
<p>Abstract: Technical debt refers to the consequences of sub-optimal decisions made during software development that prioritize short-term benefits over long-term maintainability. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is a specific form of technical debt, explicitly documented by developers within software artifacts such as source code comments and commit messages. As SATD can hinder software development and maintenance, it is crucial to estimate the effort required to repay it so that we can effectively prioritize it. However, we currently lack an understanding of SATD repayment, and more importantly, we lack approaches that can automatically estimate the repayment effort of SATD based on its textual description. To bridge this gap, we have curated a comprehensive dataset of 341,740 SATD items from 2,568,728 commits across 1,060 Apache repositories and analyzed the repayment effort comparing SATD vs. non-SATD items, as well as different types of SATD items. Furthermore, we proposed an innovative approach for Predicting Repayment Effort of SATD using Textual Information, named PRESTI. Our findings show that different types of SATD require varying levels of repayment effort, with code/design, requirement, and test debt demanding greater effort compared to non-SATD items, while documentation debt requires less. We have evaluated our approaches, particularly BERT- and TextCNN-based models, which outperform traditional machine learning methods and the baseline in estimating repayment effort. Additionally, we summarize keywords associated with varying levels of repayment effort that occur during SATD repayment. Our work aims to enhance SATD repayment prioritization and resource allocation, thereby improving software development and maintainability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensemble learning leverages multiple models (i.e., weak learners) on a common machine learning task to enhance prediction performance. Basic ensembling approaches average the weak learners outputs, while more sophisticated ones stack a machine learning model in between the weak learners outputs and the final prediction. This work fuses both aforementioned frameworks. We introduce an aggregated f-average (AFA) shallow neural network which models and combines different types of averages to perform an optimal aggregation of the weak learners predictions. We emphasise its interpretable architecture and simple training strategy, and illustrate its good performance on the problem of few-shot class incremental learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung-Woo Chang, Ke Sun, Nasimeh Heydaribeni, Seira Hidano, Xinyu Zhang, Farinaz Koushanfar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been instrumental in enabling joint transceiver optimization by merging all physical layer blocks of the end-to-end wireless communication systems. Although there have been a number of adversarial attacks on ML-based wireless systems, the existing methods do not provide a comprehensive view including multi-modality of the source data, common physical layer protocols, and wireless domain constraints. This paper proposes Magmaw, a novel wireless attack methodology capable of generating universal adversarial perturbations for any multimodal signal transmitted over a wireless channel. We further introduce new objectives for adversarial attacks on downstream applications. We adopt the widely-used defenses to verify the resilience of Magmaw. For proof-of-concept evaluation, we build a real-time wireless attack platform using a software-defined radio system. Experimental results demonstrate that Magmaw causes significant performance degradation even in the presence of strong defense mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Song, Marco Paolieri, Harper E. Stewart, Leana Golubchik, Jill L. McNitt-Gray, Vishal Misra, Devavrat Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Our aim is to determine if data collected with inertial measurement units (IMUs) during steady-state running could be used to estimate ground reaction forces (GRFs) and to derive biomechanical variables (e.g., contact time, impulse, change in velocity) using lightweight machine-learning approaches. In contrast, state-of-the-art estimation using LSTMs suffers from prohibitive inference times on edge devices, requires expensive training and hyperparameter optimization, and results in black box models. Methods: We proposed a novel lightweight solution, SVD Embedding Regression (SER), using linear regression between SVD embeddings of IMU data and GRF data. We also compared lightweight solutions including SER and k-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) regression with state-of-the-art LSTMs. Results: We performed extensive experiments to evaluate these techniques under multiple scenarios and combinations of IMU signals and quantified estimation errors for predicting GRFs and biomechanical variables. We did this using training data from different athletes, from the same athlete, or both, and we explored the use of acceleration and angular velocity data from sensors at different locations (sacrum and shanks). Conclusion: Our results illustrated that lightweight solutions such as SER and KNN can be similarly accurate or more accurate than LSTMs. The use of personal data reduced estimation errors of all methods, particularly for most biomechanical variables (as compared to GRFs); moreover, this gain was more pronounced in the lightweight methods. Significance: The study of GRFs is used to characterize the mechanical loading experienced by individuals in movements such as running, which is clinically applicable to identify athletes at risk for stress-related injuries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Fan (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China), Haolin Zuo (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China), Rui Liu (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China), Zheng Lian (Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China), Guanglai Gao (Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China)</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) in practical scenarios is significantly challenged by the presence of missing or incomplete data across different modalities. To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, while still retaining information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods. Extensive experimental evaluations on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise scheduler and the excellent performance of our proposed model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhen Liang (Syracuse University), Han Zhuang (Northeastern University), James Zou (Stanford University), Daniel E. Acuna (University of Colorado at Boulder)</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen fast paced development in industry and academia. However, striking recent advances by industry have stunned the field, inviting a fresh perspective on the role of academic research on this progress. Here, we characterize the impact and type of AI produced by both environments over the last 25 years and establish several patterns. We find that articles published by teams consisting exclusively of industry researchers tend to get greater attention, with a higher chance of being highly cited and citation-disruptive, and several times more likely to produce state-of-the-art models. In contrast, we find that exclusively academic teams publish the bulk of AI research and tend to produce higher novelty work, with single papers having several times higher likelihood of being unconventional and atypical. The respective impact-novelty advantages of industry and academia are robust to controls for subfield, team size, seniority, and prestige. We find that academic-industry collaborations produce the most impactful work overall but do not have the novelty level of academic teams. Together, our findings identify the unique and nearly irreplaceable contributions that both academia and industry make toward the progress of AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soaad Hossain, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the success of ChatGPT, LaMDA and other large language models (LLMs), there has been an increase in development and usage of LLMs within the technology sector and other sectors. While the level in which LLMs has not reached a level where it has surpassed human intelligence, there will be a time when it will. Such LLMs can be referred to as advanced LLMs. Currently, there are limited usage of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) principles and guidelines addressing advanced LLMs due to the fact that we have not reached that point yet. However, this is a problem as once we do reach that point, we will not be adequately prepared to deal with the aftermath of it in an ethical and optimal way, which will lead to undesired and unexpected consequences. This paper addresses this issue by discussing what ethical AI principles and guidelines can be used to address highly advanced LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongru Wang, Wenyu Huang, Yang Deng, Rui Wang, Zezhong Wang, Yufei Wang, Fei Mi, Jeff Z. Pan, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown exceptional capabilities in many natual language understanding and generation tasks. However, the personalization issue still remains a much-coveted property, especially when it comes to the multiple sources involved in the dialogue system. To better plan and incorporate the use of multiple sources in generating personalized response, we firstly decompose it into three sub-tasks: Knowledge Source Selection, Knowledge Retrieval, and Response Generation. We then propose a novel Unified Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (UniMS-RAG) Specifically, we unify these three sub-tasks with different formulations into the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm during the training, to adaptively retrieve evidences and evaluate the relevance on-demand using special tokens, called acting tokens and evaluation tokens. Enabling language models to generate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources, allowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements. Meanwhile, evaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and the retrieved evidence. In addition, we carefully design a self-refinement mechanism to iteratively refine the generated response considering 1) the consistency scores between the generated response and retrieved evidence; and 2) the relevance scores. Experiments on two personalized datasets (DuLeMon and KBP) show that UniMS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the knowledge source selection and response generation task with itself as a retriever in a unified manner. Extensive analyses and discussions are provided for shedding some new perspectives for personalized dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chrisantus Eze, Christopher Crick</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linh Trinh, Quang-Hung Luu, Thai M. Nguyen, Hai L. Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: Stress testing is an approach for evaluating the reliability of systems under extreme conditions which help reveal vulnerable scenarios that standard testing may overlook. Identifying such scenarios is of great importance in autonomous vehicles (AV) and other safety-critical systems. Since failure events are rare, naive random search approaches require a large number of vehicle operation hours to identify potential system failures. Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) is a method addressing this constraint by effectively exploring the failure trajectories of AV using a Markov decision process and employs reinforcement learning techniques to identify driving scenarios with high probability of failures. However, existing AST frameworks are able to handle only simple scenarios, such as one vehicle moving longitudinally on a single lane road which is not realistic and has a limited applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel AST framework to systematically explore corner cases of intelligent driving models that can result in safety concerns involving both longitudinal and lateral vehicle's movements. Specially, we develop a new reward function for Deep Reinforcement Learning to guide the AST in identifying crash scenarios based on the collision probability estimate between the AV under test (i.e., the ego vehicle) and the trajectory of other vehicles on the multi-lane roads. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we tested it with a complex driving model vehicle that can be controlled in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of our experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art AST scheme in identifying corner cases with complex driving maneuvers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have excelled in machine learning, particularly in vision tasks, however, they often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. In this work, we introduce Cobweb4V, an alternative to traditional neural network approaches. Cobweb4V is a novel visual classification method that builds on Cobweb, a human like learning system that is inspired by the way humans incrementally learn new concepts over time. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation, showcasing Cobweb4Vs proficiency in learning visual concepts, requiring less data to achieve effective learning outcomes compared to traditional methods, maintaining stable performance over time, and achieving commendable asymptotic behavior, without catastrophic forgetting effects. These characteristics align with learning strategies in human cognition, positioning Cobweb4V as a promising alternative to neural network approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Li, Jingyi Liu, Weijun Li, Lina Yu, Min Wu, Wenqiang Li, Meilan Hao, Su Wei, Yusong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical formulas are the crystallization of human wisdom in exploring the laws of nature for thousands of years. Describing the complex laws of nature with a concise mathematical formula is a constant pursuit of scientists and a great challenge for artificial intelligence. This field is called symbolic regression (SR). Symbolic regression was originally formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, and Genetic Programming (GP) and Reinforcement Learning algorithms were used to solve it. However, GP is sensitive to hyperparameters, and these two types of algorithms are inefficient. To solve this problem, researchers treat the mapping from data to expressions as a translation problem. And the corresponding large-scale pre-trained model is introduced. However, the data and expression skeletons do not have very clear word correspondences as the two languages do. Instead, they are more like two modalities (e.g., image and text). Therefore, in this paper, we proposed MMSR. The SR problem is solved as a pure multi-modal problem, and contrastive learning is also introduced in the training process for modal alignment to facilitate later modal feature fusion. It is worth noting that to better promote the modal feature fusion, we adopt the strategy of training contrastive learning loss and other losses at the same time, which only needs one-step training, instead of training contrastive learning loss first and then training other losses. Because our experiments prove training together can make the feature extraction module and feature fusion module wearing-in better. Experimental results show that compared with multiple large-scale pre-training baselines, MMSR achieves the most advanced results on multiple mainstream datasets including SRBench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjian Luo, Yangfan Jiang, Fei Wei, Yuncheng Wu, Xiaokui Xiao, Beng Chin Ooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive generative performance in terms of both sampling quality and distribution coverage. Accordingly, proposals are made for sharing pre-trained diffusion models across different organizations, as a way of improving data utilization while enhancing privacy protection by avoiding sharing private data directly. However, the potential risks associated with such an approach have not been comprehensively examined.
  In this paper, we take an adversarial perspective to investigate the potential privacy and fairness risks associated with the sharing of diffusion models. Specifically, we investigate the circumstances in which one party (the sharer) trains a diffusion model using private data and provides another party (the receiver) black-box access to the pre-trained model for downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the sharer can execute fairness poisoning attacks to undermine the receiver's downstream models by manipulating the training data distribution of the diffusion model. Meanwhile, the receiver can perform property inference attacks to reveal the distribution of sensitive features in the sharer's dataset. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable attack performance on different types of diffusion models, which highlights the critical importance of robust data auditing and privacy protection protocols in pertinent applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models enable efficient analytics across knowledge domains, rivalling human experts in information comparisons. However, the applications of LLMs for information comparisons face scalability challenges due to the difficulties in maintaining information across large contexts and overcoming model token limitations. To address these challenges, we developed the novel Abstractive Summarization & Criteria-driven Comparison Endpoint (ASC$^2$End) system to automate information comparison at scale. Our system employs Semantic Text Similarity comparisons for generating evidence-supported analyses. We utilize proven data-handling strategies such as abstractive summarization and retrieval augmented generation to overcome token limitations and retain relevant information during model inference. Prompts were designed using zero-shot strategies to contextualize information for improved model reasoning. We evaluated abstractive summarization using ROUGE scoring and assessed the generated comparison quality using survey responses. Models evaluated on the ASC$^2$End system show desirable results providing insights on the expected performance of the system. ASC$^2$End is a novel system and tool that enables accurate, automated information comparison at scale across knowledge domains, overcoming limitations in context length and retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Tomas Arias-Vergara, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Tobias Weise, Kai Packhaeuser, Maria Schuster, Elmar Noeth, Andreas Maier, Seung Hee Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Integration of speech into healthcare has intensified privacy concerns due to its potential as a non-invasive biomarker containing individual biometric information. In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both deep-learning-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods. We document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experience minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia shows slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis reveals consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized and disorder-specific approaches to account for inversion attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongdong Luo, Haojia Lin, Xiawu Zheng, Yigeng Jiang, Fei Chao, Jie Hu, Guannan Jiang, Songan Zhang, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) and 3D Dense Captioning (3DDC) are two crucial tasks in various 3D applications, which require both shared and complementary information in localization and visual-language relationships. Therefore, existing approaches adopt the two-stage "detect-then-describe/discriminate" pipeline, which relies heavily on the performance of the detector, resulting in suboptimal performance. Inspired by DETR, we propose a unified framework, 3DGCTR, to jointly solve these two distinct but closely related tasks in an end-to-end fashion. The key idea is to reconsider the prompt-based localization ability of the 3DVG model. In this way, the 3DVG model with a well-designed prompt as input can assist the 3DDC task by extracting localization information from the prompt. In terms of implementation, we integrate a Lightweight Caption Head into the existing 3DVG network with a Caption Text Prompt as a connection, effectively harnessing the existing 3DVG model's inherent localization capacity, thereby boosting 3DDC capability. This integration facilitates simultaneous multi-task training on both tasks, mutually enhancing their performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Specifically, on the ScanRefer dataset, 3DGCTR surpasses the state-of-the-art 3DDC method by 4.3% in CIDEr@0.5IoU in MLE training and improves upon the SOTA 3DVG method by 3.16% in Acc@0.25IoU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Monninger, Vandana Dokkadi, Md Zafar Anwar, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p>

To overcome these limitations, we present a novel adaptive agent that leverages transfer learning techniques to dynamically adapt policy in response to different tasks and environmental conditions. The approach is validated through the blimp control challenge, where multitasking capabilities and environmental adaptability are essential. The agent is trained using a custom, highly parallelized simulator built on IsaacGym. We perform zero-shot transfer to fly the blimp in the real world to solve various tasks.

Machine learning models are trained on these pre-processed datasets, and their predictions are expected to be fair. However, such approaches may exclude relevant data, making the attained subsets less trustworthy for further usage. To enhance the trustworthiness of prior methods, we propose additional requirements and objectives that the subsets must fulfill in addition to fairness: (1) group coverage, and (2) minimal data loss. While removing entire groups may improve the measured fairness, this practice is very problematic as failing to represent every group cannot be considered fair. In our second concern, we advocate for the retention of data while minimizing discrimination. By introducing a multi-objective optimization problem that considers fairness and data loss, we propose a methodology to find Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these objectives. By identifying such solutions, users can make informed decisions about the trade-off between fairness and data quality and select the most suitable subset for their application. Our method is distributed as a Python package via PyPI under the name FairDo (https://github.com/mkduong-ai/fairdo).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Zhaowei Li, Qi Xu, Yiqing Cai, Hang Song, Qi Qi, Ran Zhou, Zhida Huang, Tao Wang, Li Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) faces considerable challenges concerning resource constraints and inference efficiency. Recent research has increasingly focused on smaller, task-specific models enhanced by distilling knowledge from LLMs. However, prior studies have often overlooked the diversity and quality of knowledge, especially the untapped potential of negative knowledge. Constructing effective negative knowledge remains severely understudied. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called quality-guided contrastive rationale distillation aimed at enhancing reasoning capabilities through contrastive knowledge learning. For positive knowledge, we enrich its diversity through temperature sampling and employ self-consistency for further denoising and refinement. For negative knowledge, we propose an innovative self-adversarial approach that generates low-quality rationales by sampling previous iterations of smaller language models, embracing the idea that one can learn from one's own weaknesses. A contrastive loss is developed to distill both positive and negative knowledge into smaller language models, where an online-updating discriminator is integrated to assess qualities of rationales and assign them appropriate weights, optimizing the training process. Through extensive experiments across multiple reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation techniques, yielding higher-quality rationales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shifan Zhao (Carl), Jiaying Lu (Carl), Ji Yang (Carl), Edmond Chow, Yuanzhe Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used in statistics and machine learning for prediction tasks requiring uncertainty measures. Its efficacy depends on the appropriate specification of the mean function, covariance kernel function, and associated hyperparameters. Severe misspecifications can lead to inaccurate results and problematic consequences, especially in safety-critical applications. However, a systematic approach to handle these misspecifications is lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose a general framework to address these issues. Firstly, we introduce a flexible two-stage GPR framework that separates mean prediction and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to prevent mean misspecification, which can introduce bias into the model. Secondly, kernel function misspecification is addressed through a novel automatic kernel search algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis, that selects the optimal kernel from a candidate set. Additionally, we propose a subsampling-based warm-start strategy for hyperparameter initialization to improve efficiency and avoid hyperparameter misspecification. With much lower computational cost, our subsampling-based strategy can yield competitive or better performance than training exclusively on the full dataset. Combining all these components, we recommend two GPR methods-exact and scalable-designed to match available computational resources and specific UQ requirements. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets, including UCI benchmarks and a safety-critical medical case study, demonstrates the robustness and precision of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Khoi Duong, Stefan Conrad</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the recital (67) of the current corrigendum of the AI Act in the European Union, we propose and present measures and mitigation strategies for discrimination in tabular datasets. We specifically focus on datasets that contain multiple protected attributes, such as nationality, age, and sex. This makes measuring and mitigating bias more challenging, as many existing methods are designed for a single protected attribute. This paper comes with a twofold contribution: Firstly, new discrimination measures are introduced. These measures are categorized in our framework along with existing ones, guiding researchers and practitioners in choosing the right measure to assess the fairness of the underlying dataset. Secondly, a novel application of an existing bias mitigation method, FairDo, is presented. We show that this strategy can mitigate any type of discrimination, including intersectional discrimination, by transforming the dataset. By conducting experiments on real-world datasets (Adult, Bank, COMPAS), we demonstrate that de-biasing datasets with multiple protected attributes is possible. All transformed datasets show a reduction in discrimination, on average by 28%. Further, these datasets do not compromise any of the tested machine learning models' performances significantly compared to the original datasets. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy used and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the implementation of the European Union's AI Act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\'o Fontana, Francesco Pierri, Luca Maria Aiello</p>
<p>Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) as artificial social agents is largely unexplored, and we still lack extensive evidence of how these agents react to simple social stimuli. Testing the behavior of AI agents in classic Game Theory experiments provides a promising theoretical framework for evaluating the norms and values of these agents in archetypal social situations. In this work, we investigate the cooperative behavior of three LLMs (Llama2, Llama3, and GPT3.5) when playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma against random adversaries displaying various levels of hostility. We introduce a systematic methodology to evaluate an LLM's comprehension of the game rules and its capability to parse historical gameplay logs for decision-making. We conducted simulations of games lasting for 100 rounds and analyzed the LLMs' decisions in terms of dimensions defined in the behavioral economics literature. We find that all models tend not to initiate defection but act cautiously, favoring cooperation over defection only when the opponent's defection rate is low. Overall, LLMs behave at least as cooperatively as the typical human player, although our results indicate some substantial differences among models. In particular, Llama2 and GPT3.5 are more cooperative than humans, and especially forgiving and non-retaliatory for opponent defection rates below 30%. More similar to humans, Llama3 exhibits consistently uncooperative and exploitative behavior unless the opponent always cooperates. Our systematic approach to the study of LLMs in game theoretical scenarios is a step towards using these simulations to inform practices of LLM auditing and alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokman Saleh, Hafedh Mili, Mounir Boukadoum, Abderrahmane Leshob</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain experts from all fields are called upon, working with data scientists, to explore the use of ML techniques to solve their problems. Starting from a domain problem/question, ML-based problem-solving typically involves three steps: (1) formulating the business problem (problem domain) as a data analysis problem (solution domain), (2) sketching a high-level ML-based solution pattern, given the domain requirements and the properties of the available data, and (3) designing and refining the different components of the solution pattern. There has to be a substantial body of ML problem solving knowledge that ML researchers agree on, and that ML practitioners routinely apply to solve the most common problems. Our work deals with capturing this body of knowledge, and embodying it in a ML problem solving workbench to helps domain specialists who are not ML experts to explore the ML solution space. This paper focuses on: 1) the representation of domain problems, ML problems, and the main ML solution artefacts, and 2) a heuristic matching function that helps identify the ML algorithm family that is most appropriate for the domain problem at hand, given the domain (expert) requirements, and the characteristics of the training data. We review related work and outline our strategy for validating the workbench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Zhang, Minho Heo, Zuxin Liu, Erdem Biyik, Joseph J Lim, Yao Liu, Rasool Fakoor</p>
<p>Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods focus on learning optimal policies over low-level action spaces. While these methods can perform well in their training environments, they lack the flexibility to transfer to new tasks. Instead, RL agents that can act over useful, temporally extended skills rather than low-level actions can learn new tasks more easily. Prior work in skill-based RL either requires expert supervision to define useful skills, which is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space from offline data with heuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making them difficult to transfer during downstream RL. Our approach, EXTRACT, instead utilizes pre-trained vision language models to extract a discrete set of semantically meaningful skills from offline data, each of which is parameterized by continuous arguments, without human supervision. This skill parameterization allows robots to learn new tasks by only needing to learn when to select a specific skill and how to modify its arguments for the specific task. We demonstrate through experiments in sparse-reward, image-based, robot manipulation environments that EXTRACT can more quickly learn new tasks than prior works, with major gains in sample efficiency and performance over prior skill-based RL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Philipp Klein, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohini Roychowdhury, Marko Krema, Brian Moore, Xingjian Lai, Dike Effedua, Bharat Jethwani</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial report generation using general purpose large language models (LLMs) pose two major challenges namely, the lack of compound sentences and hallucinations. Advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques are limited in scope for curing these writing style discrepancies. In this work we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning (FT) process wherein public domain financial reports are processed into prompt-completions and augmented using simple LLM prompts to then enable sectional financial report generation using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs. The proposed fine-tuning process exploits the self-learning capability of LLMs by allowing hallucinations in the first stage and showing the corrections in the second stage. Our proposed fine-tuning framework results doubles the number of correct questions answers and reduces hallucinations by over 50%. Additionally, the two-stage FT model has lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy. Thus, the proposed framework can be generalized to domain specific fine-tuning tasks at minimized tuning costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Xiao, Runze Chen, Haiyong Luo, Fang Zhao, Juan Wang, Xuepeng Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Map-free relocalization technology is crucial for applications in autonomous navigation and augmented reality, but relying on pre-built maps is often impractical. It faces significant challenges due to limitations in matching methods and the inherent lack of scale in monocular images. These issues lead to substantial rotational and metric errors and even localization failures in real-world scenarios. Large matching errors significantly impact the overall relocalization process, affecting both rotational and translational accuracy. Due to the inherent limitations of the camera itself, recovering the metric scale from a single image is crucial, as this significantly impacts the translation error. To address these challenges, we propose a map-free relocalization method enhanced by instance knowledge and depth knowledge. By leveraging instance-based matching information to improve global matching results, our method significantly reduces the possibility of mismatching across different objects. The robustness of instance knowledge across the scene helps the feature point matching model focus on relevant regions and enhance matching accuracy. Additionally, we use estimated metric depth from a single image to reduce metric errors and improve scale recovery accuracy. By integrating methods dedicated to mitigating large translational and rotational errors, our approach demonstrates superior performance in map-free relocalization techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Ye, Peiwen Sun, Jiahe Lei, Hongzhan Lin, Xu Tan, Zheqi Dai, Qiuqiang Kong, Jianyi Chen, Jiahao Pan, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation.

<p>Abstract: Automatic disease diagnosis has become increasingly valuable in clinical practice. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, with growing evidence supporting the efficacy of LLMs in diagnostic tasks. Despite the increasing attention in this field, a holistic view is still lacking. Many critical aspects remain unclear, such as the diseases and clinical data to which LLMs have been applied, the LLM techniques employed, and the evaluation methods used. In this article, we perform a comprehensive review of LLM-based methods for disease diagnosis. Our review examines the existing literature across various dimensions, including disease types and associated clinical specialties, clinical data, LLM techniques, and evaluation methods. Additionally, we offer recommendations for applying and evaluating LLMs for diagnostic tasks. Furthermore, we assess the limitations of current research and discuss future directions.

<p>Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issue \citep{qi2023fine} poses serious safety concerns for Large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses \citep{huang2024vaccine,rosati2024representation} have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. For the first time in the literature, we in this paper show that \textit{harmful perturbation} over the model weights should be the root cause of alignment-broken of harmful fine-tuning. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction before/after simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

<p>Abstract: In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinwei Wu, Xianpan Zhou, Bing Ma, Xuefeng Su, Kai Ma, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating visually appealing images of individual instances, they struggle to accurately position and control the features generation of multiple instances. The Layout-to-Image (L2I) task was introduced to address the positioning challenges by incorporating bounding boxes as spatial control signals, but it still falls short in generating precise instance features. In response, we propose the Instance Feature Generation (IFG) task, which aims to ensure both positional accuracy and feature fidelity in generated instances. To address the IFG task, we introduce the Instance Feature Adapter (IFAdapter). The IFAdapter enhances feature depiction by incorporating additional appearance tokens and utilizing an Instance Semantic Map to align instance-level features with spatial locations. The IFAdapter guides the diffusion process as a plug-and-play module, making it adaptable to various community models. For evaluation, we contribute an IFG benchmark and develop a verification pipeline to objectively compare models' abilities to generate instances with accurate positioning and features. Experimental results demonstrate that IFAdapter outperforms other models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p>

We experimentally demonstrate three simple curricula, such as varying only the variable of highest regret between episodes, that can significantly enhance policy robustness, offering practical insights for reinforcement learning in complex environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in plan generation. Yet, existing datasets often lack the complexity needed for advanced tool use scenarios - such as handling paraphrased query statements, supporting multiple languages, and managing actions that can be done in parallel. These scenarios are crucial for evaluating the evolving capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. Moreover, current datasets don't enable the study of LLMs from a process perspective, particularly in scenarios where understanding typical behaviors and challenges in executing the same process under different conditions or formulations is crucial. To address these gaps, we present the ProcessTBench synthetic dataset, an extension of the TaskBench dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLMs within a process mining framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumera Anjum, Hanzhi Zhang, Wenjun Zhou, Eun Jin Paek, Xiaopeng Zhao, Yunhe Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks, yet they are susceptible to generating inaccurate or unreliable responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. In critical domains such as health and medicine, these hallucinations can pose serious risks. This paper introduces HALO, a novel framework designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of medical question-answering (QA) systems by focusing on the detection and mitigation of hallucinations. Our approach generates multiple variations of a given query using LLMs and retrieves relevant information from external open knowledge bases to enrich the context. We utilize maximum marginal relevance scoring to prioritize the retrieved context, which is then provided to LLMs for answer generation, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations. The integration of LangChain further streamlines this process, resulting in a notable and robust increase in the accuracy of both open-source and commercial LLMs, such as Llama-3.1 (from 44% to 65%) and ChatGPT (from 56% to 70%). This framework underscores the critical importance of addressing hallucinations in medical QA systems, ultimately improving clinical decision-making and patient care.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saba Sturua, Isabelle Mohr, Mohammad Kalim Akram, Michael G\"unther, Bo Wang, Markus Krimmel, Feng Wang, Georgios Mastrapas, Andreas Koukounas, Nan Wang, Han Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v3, a novel text embedding model with 570 million parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual data and long-context retrieval tasks, supporting context lengths of up to 8192 tokens. The model includes a set of task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to generate high-quality embeddings for query-document retrieval, clustering, classification, and text matching. Evaluation on the MTEB benchmark shows that jina-embeddings-v3 outperforms the latest proprietary embeddings from OpenAI and Cohere on English tasks, while achieving superior performance compared to multilingual-e5-large-instruct across all multilingual tasks. With a default output dimension of 1024, users can flexibly reduce the embedding dimensions to as low as 32 without compromising performance, enabled by Matryoshka Representation Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Towers, Aleksandra Kalisz, Philippe A. Robert, Alicia Higueruelo, Francesca Vianello, Ming-Han Chloe Tsai, Harrison Steel, Jakob N. Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed or evolved towards the current strains of a virus. In learning terms, this corresponds to a myopic best response, i.e., not considering the possible adaptive moves of the opponent. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. To motivate our work, we consider antibody designs that target not only the current viral strains but also the wide range of possible future variants that the virus might evolve into under the evolutionary pressure exerted by said antibodies. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of the viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simple model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikit Srivastava, Denis Kuchelev, Tatiana Moteu Ngoli, Kshitij Shetty, Michael R\"oder, Diego Moussallem, Hamada Zahera, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Zhou, Zhengqing Yuan, Zhiling Yan, Weixiang Sun, Kai Zhang, Yiwei Li, Yanfang Ye, Xiang Li, Lifang He, Lichao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is crucial for accurately diagnosing and analyzing various diseases. However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, the most commonly used architectures for this task, struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs and the computational complexity of Transformers. To address this limitation, we introduce TTT-Unet, a novel framework that integrates Test-Time Training (TTT) layers into the traditional U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. TTT-Unet dynamically adjusts model parameters during the testing time, enhancing the model's ability to capture both local and long-range features. We evaluate TTT-Unet on multiple medical imaging datasets, including 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results demonstrate that TTT-Unet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation models across all tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Dutta, Pavana P Karanth, Pedro Maciel Xavier, Iago Leal de Freitas, Nouhaila Innan, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique, David E. Bernal Neira</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Ferraro, Pietro Mazzaglia, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt, Sai Rajeswar</p>
<p>Abstract: Object manipulation capabilities are essential skills that set apart embodied agents engaging with the world, especially in the realm of robotics. The ability to predict outcomes of interactions with objects is paramount in this setting. While model-based control methods have started to be employed for tackling manipulation tasks, they have faced challenges in accurately manipulating objects. As we analyze the causes of this limitation, we identify the cause of underperformance in the way current world models represent crucial positional information, especially about the target's goal specification for object positioning tasks. We introduce a general approach that empowers world model-based agents to effectively solve object-positioning tasks. We propose two declinations of this approach for generative world models: position-conditioned (PCP) and latent-conditioned (LCP) policy learning. In particular, LCP employs object-centric latent representations that explicitly capture object positional information for goal specification. This naturally leads to the emergence of multimodal capabilities, enabling the specification of goals through spatial coordinates or a visual goal. Our methods are rigorously evaluated across several manipulation environments, showing favorable performance compared to current model-based control approaches.</p>
