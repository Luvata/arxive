<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikola Bugarin, Jovana Bugaric, Manuel Barusco, Davide Dalle Pezze, Gian Antonio Susto</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly Detection is a relevant problem in numerous real-world applications, especially when dealing with images. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of changes over time in the input data distribution, which may cause a significant decrease in performance. In this study, we investigate the problem of Pixel-Level Anomaly Detection in the Continual Learning setting, where new data arrives over time and the goal is to perform well on new and old data. We implement several state-of-the-art techniques to solve the Anomaly Detection problem in the classic setting and adapt them to work in the Continual Learning setting. To validate the approaches, we use a real-world dataset of images with pixel-based anomalies to provide a reliable benchmark and serve as a foundation for further advancements in the field. We provide a comprehensive analysis, discussing which Anomaly Detection methods and which families of approaches seem more suitable for the Continual Learning setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching-Hsiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the robust development of technology, license plate recognition technology can now be properly applied in various scenarios, such as road monitoring, tracking of stolen vehicles, detection at parking lot entrances and exits, and so on. However, the precondition for these applications to function normally is that the license plate must be 'clear' enough to be recognized by the system with the correct license plate number. If the license plate becomes blurred due to some external factors, then the accuracy of recognition will be greatly reduced. Although there are many road surveillance cameras in Taiwan, the quality of most cameras is not good, often leading to the inability to recognize license plate numbers due to low photo resolution. Therefore, this study focuses on using super-resolution technology to process blurred license plates. This study will mainly fine-tune three super-resolution models: Real-ESRGAN, A-ESRGAN, and StarSRGAN, and compare their effectiveness in enhancing the resolution of license plate photos and enabling accurate license plate recognition. By comparing different super-resolution models, it is hoped to find the most suitable model for this task, providing valuable references for future researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsuan-Cheng Liao, Chih-Hong Cheng, Hasan Esen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents safety-oriented object detection via a novel Ego-Centric Intersection-over-Union (EC-IoU) measure, addressing practical concerns when applying state-of-the-art learning-based perception models in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. Concretely, we propose a weighting mechanism to refine the widely used IoU measure, allowing it to assign a higher score to a prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical evaluation processes to select object detectors with higher safety-related performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean Average Precision as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Kenny Jones, Siddhartha Chaudhuri, Daniel Ritchie</p>
<p>Abstract: People grasp flexible visual concepts from a few examples. We explore a neurosymbolic system that learns how to infer programs that capture visual concepts in a domain-general fashion. We introduce Template Programs: programmatic expressions from a domain-specific language that specify structural and parametric patterns common to an input concept. Our framework supports multiple concept-related tasks, including few-shot generation and co-segmentation through parsing. We develop a learning paradigm that allows us to train networks that infer Template Programs directly from visual datasets that contain concept groupings. We run experiments across multiple visual domains: 2D layouts, Omniglot characters, and 3D shapes. We find that our method outperforms task-specific alternatives, and performs competitively against domain-specific approaches for the limited domains where they exist.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura O'Mahony, David JP O'Sullivan, Nikola S. Nikolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution data and anomalous inputs are vulnerabilities of machine learning systems today, often causing systems to make incorrect predictions. The diverse range of data on which these models are used makes detecting atypical inputs a difficult and important task. We assess a tool, Benford's law, as a method used to quantify the difference between real and corrupted inputs. We believe that in many settings, it could function as a filter for anomalous data points and for signalling out-of-distribution data. We hope to open a discussion on these applications and further areas where this technique is underexplored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Wenbo Hu, Yixing Lao, Tong He, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results while advancing real-time rendering performance. However, it relies heavily on the quality of the initial point cloud, resulting in blurring and needle-like artifacts in areas with insufficient initializing points. This is mainly attributed to the point cloud growth condition in 3DGS that only considers the average gradient magnitude of points from observable views, thereby failing to grow for large Gaussians that are observable for many viewpoints while many of them are only covered in the boundaries. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Pixel-GS, to take into account the number of pixels covered by the Gaussian in each view during the computation of the growth condition. We regard the covered pixel numbers as the weights to dynamically average the gradients from different views, such that the growth of large Gaussians can be prompted. As a result, points within the areas with insufficient initializing points can be grown more effectively, leading to a more accurate and detailed reconstruction. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to scale the gradient field according to the distance to the camera, to suppress the growth of floaters near the camera. Extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed, on the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Auty, Krystian Mikolajczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is inherently ambiguous, as a given image may result from many different 3D scenes and vice versa. To resolve this ambiguity, an MDE system must make assumptions about the most likely 3D scenes for a given input. These assumptions can be either explicit or implicit. In this work, we demonstrate the use of natural language as a source of an explicit prior about the structure of the world. The assumption is made that human language encodes the likely distribution in depth-space of various objects. We first show that a language model encodes this implicit bias during training, and that it can be extracted using a very simple learned approach. We then show that this prediction can be provided as an explicit source of assumption to an MDE system, using an off-the-shelf instance segmentation model that provides the labels used as the input to the language model. We demonstrate the performance of our method on the NYUD2 dataset, showing improvement compared to the baseline and to random controls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Zhao, Chen Song, Xiaodong Gu, Yuan Dong, Qi Zuo, Weihao Yuan, Zilong Dong, Liefeng Bo, Qixing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in the texturing of 3D meshes using pre-trained text-to-image models is to ensure multi-view consistency. State-of-the-art approaches typically use diffusion models to aggregate multi-view inputs, where common issues are the blurriness caused by the averaging operation in the aggregation step or inconsistencies in local features. This paper introduces an optimization framework that proceeds in four stages to achieve multi-view consistency. Specifically, the first stage generates an over-complete set of 2D textures from a predefined set of viewpoints using an MV-consistent diffusion process. The second stage selects a subset of views that are mutually consistent while covering the underlying 3D model. We show how to achieve this goal by solving semi-definite programs. The third stage performs non-rigid alignment to align the selected views across overlapping regions. The fourth stage solves an MRF problem to associate each mesh face with a selected view. In particular, the third and fourth stages are iterated, with the cuts obtained in the fourth stage encouraging non-rigid alignment in the third stage to focus on regions close to the cuts. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15583">U-ARE-ME: Uncertainty-Aware Rotation Estimation in Manhattan Environments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aalok Patwardhan, Callum Rhodes, Gwangbin Bae, Andrew J. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera rotation estimation from a single image is a challenging task, often requiring depth data and/or camera intrinsics, which are generally not available for in-the-wild videos. Although external sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can help, they often suffer from drift and are not applicable in non-inertial reference frames. We present U-ARE-ME, an algorithm that estimates camera rotation along with uncertainty from uncalibrated RGB images. Using a Manhattan World assumption, our method leverages the per-pixel geometric priors encoded in single-image surface normal predictions and performs optimisation over the SO(3) manifold. Given a sequence of images, we can use the per-frame rotation estimates and their uncertainty to perform multi-frame optimisation, achieving robustness and temporal consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that U-ARE-ME performs comparably to RGB-D methods and is more robust than sparse feature-based SLAM methods. We encourage the reader to view the accompanying video at https://callum-rhodes.github.io/U-ARE-ME for a visual overview of our method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15585">MedPromptX: Grounded Multimodal Prompting for Chest X-ray Diagnosis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai A. Shaaban, Adnan Khan, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records (EHR). This paper introduces \textbf{MedPromptX}, the first model to integrate multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG aids in focusing the model's attention on relevant regions of interest in X-ray images, enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved image and EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to the baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepehr Dehdashtian, Lan Wang, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP provide compact and general-purpose representations of text and images that are demonstrably effective across multiple downstream zero-shot prediction tasks. However, owing to the nature of their training process, these models have the potential to 1) propagate or amplify societal biases in the training data and 2) learn to rely on spurious features. This paper proposes FairerCLIP, a general approach for making zero-shot predictions of CLIP more fair and robust to spurious correlations. We formulate the problem of jointly debiasing CLIP's image and text representations in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), which affords multiple benefits: 1) Flexibility: Unlike existing approaches, which are specialized to either learn with or without ground-truth labels, FairerCLIP is adaptable to learning in both scenarios. 2) Ease of Optimization: FairerCLIP lends itself to an iterative optimization involving closed-form solvers, which leads to $4\times$-$10\times$ faster training than the existing methods. 3) Sample Efficiency: Under sample-limited conditions, FairerCLIP significantly outperforms baselines when they fail entirely. And, 4) Performance: Empirically, FairerCLIP achieves appreciable accuracy gains on benchmark fairness and spurious correlation datasets over their respective baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeliang Zhang, Mingqian Feng, Jinyang Jiang, Rongyi Zhu, Yijie Peng, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based saliency maps are widely used to explain deep neural network decisions. However, as models become deeper and more black-box, such as in closed-source APIs like ChatGPT, computing gradients become challenging, hindering conventional explanation methods. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework for estimating gradients in black-box settings and generating saliency maps to interpret model decisions. We employ the likelihood ratio method to estimate output-to-input gradients and utilize them for saliency map generation. Additionally, we propose blockwise computation techniques to enhance estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments in black-box settings validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating accurate gradient estimation and explainability of generated saliency maps. Furthermore, we showcase the scalability of our approach by applying it to explain GPT-Vision, revealing the continued relevance of gradient-based explanation methods in the era of large, closed-source, and black-box models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Long Ho, Cuong Do, Danh Le-Phuoc, Kok-Seng Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain shift is a formidable issue in Machine Learning that causes a model to suffer from performance degradation when tested on unseen domains. Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) attempts to train a global model using collaborative clients in a privacy-preserving manner that can generalize well to unseen clients possibly with domain shift. However, most existing FedDG methods either cause additional privacy risks of data leakage or induce significant costs in client communication and computation, which are major concerns in the Federated Learning paradigm. To circumvent these challenges, here we introduce a novel architectural method for FedDG, namely gPerXAN, which relies on a normalization scheme working with a guiding regularizer. In particular, we carefully design Personalized eXplicitly Assembled Normalization to enforce client models selectively filtering domain-specific features that are biased towards local data while retaining discrimination of those features. Then, we incorporate a simple yet effective regularizer to guide these models in directly capturing domain-invariant representations that the global model's classifier can leverage. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets, i.e., PACS and Office-Home, and a real-world medical dataset, Camelyon17, indicate that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods in addressing this particular problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sisi Dai, Wenhao Li, Haowen Sun, Haibin Huang, Chongyang Ma, Hui Huang, Kai Xu, Ruizhen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we tackle the complex task of generating 3D human-object interactions (HOI) from textual descriptions in a zero-shot text-to-3D manner. We identify and address two key challenges: the unsatisfactory outcomes of direct text-to-3D methods in HOI, largely due to the lack of paired text-interaction data, and the inherent difficulties in simultaneously generating multiple concepts with complex spatial relationships. To effectively address these issues, we present InterFusion, a two-stage framework specifically designed for HOI generation. InterFusion involves human pose estimations derived from text as geometric priors, which simplifies the text-to-3D conversion process and introduces additional constraints for accurate object generation. At the first stage, InterFusion extracts 3D human poses from a synthesized image dataset depicting a wide range of interactions, subsequently mapping these poses to interaction descriptions. The second stage of InterFusion capitalizes on the latest developments in text-to-3D generation, enabling the production of realistic and high-quality 3D HOI scenes. This is achieved through a local-global optimization process, where the generation of human body and object is optimized separately, and jointly refined with a global optimization of the entire scene, ensuring a seamless and contextually coherent integration. Our experimental results affirm that InterFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D HOI generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding presents a significant challenge in computer vision, withwide-ranging applications in embodied agents and augmented reality systems. Previous approaches haveadopted Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to analyze 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGaussians, a novel open-vocabulary scene understanding approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our keyidea is distilling pre-trained 2D semantics into 3D Gaussians. We design a versatile projection approachthat maps various 2Dsemantic features from pre-trained image encoders into a novel semantic component of 3D Gaussians, withoutthe additional training required by NeRFs. We further build a 3D semantic network that directly predictsthe semantic component from raw 3D Gaussians for fast inference. We explore several applications ofSemantic Gaussians: semantic segmentation on ScanNet-20, where our approach attains a 4.2% mIoU and 4.0%mAcc improvement over prior open-vocabulary scene understanding counterparts; object part segmentation,sceneediting, and spatial-temporal segmentation with better qualitative results over 2D and 3D baselines,highlighting its versatility and effectiveness on supporting diverse downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for enhancing domain generalization in medical imaging, specifically focusing on utilizing unlabelled multi-view colour fundus photographs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-view imaging data and face challenges in generalizing across diverse clinical settings, our method leverages the rich information in the unlabelled multi-view imaging data to improve model robustness and accuracy. By incorporating a class balancing method, a test-time adaptation technique and a multi-view optimization strategy, we address the critical issue of domain shift that often hampers the performance of machine learning models in real-world applications. Experiments comparing various state-of-the-art domain generalization and test-time optimization methodologies show that our approach consistently outperforms when combined with existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. We also show our online method improves all existing techniques. Our framework demonstrates improvements in domain generalization capabilities and offers a practical solution for real-world deployment by facilitating online adaptation to new, unseen datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihua Cheng, Yaning Zhu, Zongji Wang, Hongquan Hao, Yongwei Liu, Shiqing Cheng, Xi Wang, Hyung Jin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Driver's eye gaze holds a wealth of cognitive and intentional cues crucial for intelligent vehicles. Despite its significance, research on in-vehicle gaze estimation remains limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets in real driving scenarios. In this paper, we present three novel elements to advance in-vehicle gaze research. Firstly, we introduce IVGaze, a pioneering dataset capturing in-vehicle gaze, collected from 125 subjects and covering a large range of gaze and head poses within vehicles. Conventional gaze collection systems are inadequate for in-vehicle use. In this dataset, we propose a new vision-based solution for in-vehicle gaze collection, introducing a refined gaze target calibration method to tackle annotation challenges. Second, our research focuses on in-vehicle gaze estimation leveraging the IVGaze. In-vehicle face images often suffer from low resolution, prompting our introduction of a gaze pyramid transformer that leverages transformer-based multilevel features integration. Expanding upon this, we introduce the dual-stream gaze pyramid transformer (GazeDPTR). Employing perspective transformation, we rotate virtual cameras to normalize images, utilizing camera pose to merge normalized and original images for accurate gaze estimation. GazeDPTR shows state-of-the-art performance on the IVGaze dataset. Thirdly, we explore a novel strategy for gaze zone classification by extending the GazeDPTR. A foundational tri-plane and project gaze onto these planes are newly defined. Leveraging both positional features from the projection points and visual attributes from images, we achieve superior performance compared to relying solely on visual features, substantiating the advantage of gaze estimation.

While it is time-consuming to manually label the collected images, recent advances in deep learning and computer vision has made it possible to automating this process [1]. A major obstacle to this is the generalisability of these models when applying these images to independently collected data from other parts of the world [2].

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yan, Zhihui Ke, Xiaobo Zhou, Tie Qiu, Xidong Shi, Dadong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video (NeRV) have recently become a novel way for high-quality video representation. However, existing works employ a single network to represent the entire video, which implicitly confuse static and dynamic information. This leads to an inability to effectively compress the redundant static information and lack the explicitly modeling of global temporal-coherent dynamic details. To solve above problems, we propose DS-NeRV, which decomposes videos into sparse learnable static codes and dynamic codes without the need for explicit optical flow or residual supervision. By setting different sampling rates for two codes and applying weighted sum and interpolation sampling methods, DS-NeRV efficiently utilizes redundant static information while maintaining high-frequency details. Additionally, we design a cross-channel attention-based (CCA) fusion module to efficiently fuse these two codes for frame decoding. Our approach achieves a high quality reconstruction of 31.2 PSNR with only 0.35M parameters thanks to separate static and dynamic codes representation and outperforms existing NeRV methods in many downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Stubbin, Thompson Chyrikov, Jim Zhao, Christina Chajo</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) plays an indispensable role in demystifying the decision-making processes of AI, especially within the healthcare industry. Clinicians rely heavily on detailed reasoning when making a diagnosis, often CT scans for specific features that distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. A comprehensive diagnostic approach includes an evaluation of imaging results, patient observations, and clinical tests. The surge in deploying deep learning models as support systems in medical diagnostics has been significant, offering advances that traditional methods could not. However, the complexity and opacity of these models present a double-edged sword. As they operate as "black boxes," with their reasoning obscured and inaccessible, there's an increased risk of misdiagnosis, which can lead to patient harm. Hence, there is a pressing need to cultivate transparency within AI systems, ensuring that the rationale behind an AI's diagnostic recommendations is clear and understandable to medical practitioners. This shift towards transparency is not just beneficial -- it's a critical step towards responsible AI integration in healthcare, ensuring that AI aids rather than hinders medical professionals in their crucial work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Huang, Yanwei Zheng, Chuanlin Lan, Xinpeng Zhao, Dongxiao yu, Yifei Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanxin Xu, Shuo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning method for extracting latent embeddings from behaviors of larval zebrafish. Drawing inspiration from Masked Modeling techniquesutilized in image processing with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked} and in natural language processing with Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) \cite{radford2018improving}, we treat behavior sequences as a blend of images and language. For the skeletal sequences of swimming zebrafish, we propose a pioneering Transformer-CNN architecture, the Sequence Spatial-Temporal Transformer (SSTFormer), designed to capture the inter-frame correlation of different joints. This correlation is particularly valuable, as it reflects the coordinated movement of various parts of the fish body across adjacent frames. To handle the high frame rate, we segment the skeleton sequence into distinct time slices, analogous to "words" in a sentence, and employ self-attention transformer layers to encode the consecutive frames within each slice, capturing the spatial correlation among different joints. Furthermore, we incorporate a CNN-based attention module to enhance the representations outputted by the transformer layers. Lastly, we introduce a temporal feature aggregation operation between time slices to improve the discrimination of similar behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengqi Zhou, Jun Hou, Chuanchen Luo, Yuxi Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Junran Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to its great application potential, large-scale scene generation has drawn extensive attention in academia and industry. Recent research employs powerful generative models to create desired scenes and achieves promising results. However, most of these methods represent the scene using 3D primitives (e.g. point cloud or radiance field) incompatible with the industrial pipeline, which leads to a substantial gap between academic research and industrial deployment. Procedural Controllable Generation (PCG) is an efficient technique for creating scalable and high-quality assets, but it is unfriendly for ordinary users as it demands profound domain expertise. To address these issues, we resort to using the large language model (LLM) to drive the procedural modeling. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale scene generation framework, SceneX, which can automatically produce high-quality procedural models according to designers' textual descriptions.Specifically, the proposed method comprises two components, PCGBench and PCGPlanner. The former encompasses an extensive collection of accessible procedural assets and thousands of hand-craft API documents. The latter aims to generate executable actions for Blender to produce controllable and precise 3D assets guided by the user's instructions. Our SceneX can generate a city spanning 2.5 km times 2.5 km with delicate layout and geometric structures, drastically reducing the time cost from several weeks for professional PCG engineers to just a few hours for an ordinary user. Extensive experiments demonstrated the capability of our method in controllable large-scale scene generation and editing, including asset placement and season translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongbin Zhang, Chuming Wang, Weitao Wang, Peihao Li, Minghan Qin, Haoqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis from unconstrained in-the-wild images remains a meaningful but challenging task. The photometric variation and transient occluders in those unconstrained images make it difficult to reconstruct the original scene accurately. Previous approaches tackle the problem by introducing a global appearance feature in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, in the real world, the unique appearance of each tiny point in a scene is determined by its independent intrinsic material attributes and the varying environmental impacts it receives. Inspired by this fact, we propose Gaussian in the wild (GS-W), a method that uses 3D Gaussian points to reconstruct the scene and introduces separated intrinsic and dynamic appearance feature for each point, capturing the unchanged scene appearance along with dynamic variation like illumination and weather. Additionally, an adaptive sampling strategy is presented to allow each Gaussian point to focus on the local and detailed information more effectively. We also reduce the impact of transient occluders using a 2D visibility map. More experiments have demonstrated better reconstruction quality and details of GS-W compared to previous methods, with a $1000\times$ increase in rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Guo, Abhinav Kumar, Cheng Zhao, Ruoyu Wang, Xinyu Huang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction for categorical objects heavily relies on accurately perceiving each object's pose. While gradient-based optimization within a NeRF framework updates initially given poses, this paper highlights that such a scheme fails when the initial pose even moderately deviates from the true pose. Consequently, existing methods often depend on a third-party 3D object to provide an initial object pose, leading to increased complexity and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we present UPNeRF, a Unified framework integrating Pose estimation and NeRF-based reconstruction, bringing us closer to real-time monocular 3D object reconstruction. UPNeRF decouples the object's dimension estimation and pose refinement to resolve the scale-depth ambiguity, and introduces an effective projected-box representation that generalizes well cross different domains. While using a dedicated pose estimator that smoothly integrates into an object-centric NeRF, UPNeRF is free from external 3D detectors. UPNeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both reconstruction and pose estimation tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, UPNeRF exhibits exceptional Cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, surpassing prior methods with up to 50% reduction in rotation and translation error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Ma, Qiong Cao, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating 3D interactive human motion from text. Given a textual description depicting the actions of different body parts in contact with objects, we synthesize sequences of 3D body poses that are visually natural and physically plausible. Yet, this task poses a significant challenge due to the inadequate consideration of interactions by physical contacts in both motion and textual descriptions, leading to unnatural and implausible sequences. To tackle this challenge, we create a novel dataset named RICH-CAT, representing ``Contact-Aware Texts'' constructed from the RICH dataset. RICH-CAT comprises high-quality motion, accurate human-object contact labels, and detailed textual descriptions, encompassing over 8,500 motion-text pairs across 26 indoor/outdoor actions. Leveraging RICH-CAT, we propose a novel approach named CATMO for text-driven interactive human motion synthesis that explicitly integrates human body contacts as evidence. We employ two VQ-VAE models to encode motion and body contact sequences into distinct yet complementary latent spaces and an intertwined GPT for generating human motions and contacts in a mutually conditioned manner. Additionally, we introduce a pre-trained text encoder to learn textual embeddings that better discriminate among various contact types, allowing for more precise control over synthesized motions and contacts. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing text-to-motion methods, producing stable, contact-aware motion sequences. Code and data will be available for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chensheng Peng, Zhaoyu Zeng, Jinling Gao, Jundong Zhou, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou, Nanyang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple object tracking is a critical task in autonomous driving. Existing works primarily focus on the heuristic design of neural networks to obtain high accuracy. As tracking accuracy improves, however, neural networks become increasingly complex, posing challenges for their practical application in real driving scenarios due to the high level of latency. In this paper, we explore the use of the neural architecture search (NAS) methods to search for efficient architectures for tracking, aiming for low real-time latency while maintaining relatively high accuracy. Another challenge for object tracking is the unreliability of a single sensor, therefore, we propose a multi-modal framework to improve the robustness. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can run on edge devices within lower latency constraints, thus greatly reducing the computational requirements for multi-modal object tracking while keeping lower latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Ruan, Jingsheng Gao, Mingye Xie, Daize Dong, Suncheng Xiang, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapter-Tuning (AT) method involves freezing a pre-trained model and introducing trainable adapter modules to acquire downstream knowledge, thereby calibrating the model for better adaptation to downstream tasks. This paper proposes a distillation framework for the AT method instead of crafting a carefully designed adapter module, which aims to improve fine-tuning performance. For the first time, we explore the possibility of combining the AT method with knowledge distillation. Via statistical analysis, we observe significant differences in the knowledge acquisition between adapter modules of different models. Leveraging these differences, we propose a simple yet effective framework called inverse Distillation Adapter-Tuning (iDAT). Specifically, we designate the smaller model as the teacher and the larger model as the student. The two are jointly trained, and online knowledge distillation is applied to inject knowledge of different perspective to student model, and significantly enhance the fine-tuning performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on the VTAB-1K benchmark with 19 image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of iDAT. The results show that using existing AT method within our iDAT framework can further yield a 2.66% performance gain, with only an additional 0.07M trainable parameters. Our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-arts without bells and whistles. Our code is available at https://github.com/JCruan519/iDAT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiping Zhuang, Yuchen Liu, Run He, Kai Tong, Ziqian Zeng, Cen Chen, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Online Class Incremental Learning (OCIL) aims to train the model in a task-by-task manner, where data arrive in mini-batches at a time while previous data are not accessible. A significant challenge is known as Catastrophic Forgetting, i.e., loss of the previous knowledge on old data. To address this, replay-based methods show competitive results but invade data privacy, while exemplar-free methods protect data privacy but struggle for accuracy. In this paper, we proposed an exemplar-free approach -- Analytic Online Class Incremental Learning (AOCIL). Instead of back-propagation, we design the Analytic Classifier (AC) updated by recursive least square, cooperating with a frozen backbone. AOCIL simultaneously achieves high accuracy, low resource consumption and data privacy protection. We conduct massive experiments on four existing benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the strong capability of handling OCIL scenarios. Codes will be ready.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Tang Li, Chenhui Chu, Nengjun Zhu, Rui Wang, Pinpin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value relations are prevalent in Visually-Rich Documents (VRDs), often depicted in distinct spatial regions accompanied by specific color and font styles. These non-textual cues serve as important indicators that greatly enhance human comprehension and acquisition of such relation triplets. However, current document AI approaches often fail to consider this valuable prior information related to visual and spatial features, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly when dealing with limited examples. To address this limitation, our research focuses on few-shot relational learning, specifically targeting the extraction of key-value relation triplets in VRDs. Given the absence of a suitable dataset for this task, we introduce two new few-shot benchmarks built upon existing supervised benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we propose a variational approach that incorporates relational 2D-spatial priors and prototypical rectification techniques. This approach aims to generate relation representations that are more aware of the spatial context and unseen relation in a manner similar to human perception. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by showcasing its ability to outperform existing methods. This study also opens up new possibilities for practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing object detectors encounter challenges in handling domain shifts between training and real-world data, particularly under poor visibility conditions like fog and night. Cutting-edge cross-domain object detection methods use teacher-student frameworks and compel teacher and student models to produce consistent predictions under weak and strong augmentations, respectively. In this paper, we reveal that manually crafted augmentations are insufficient for optimal teaching and present a simple yet effective framework named Adversarial Defense Teacher (ADT), leveraging adversarial defense to enhance teaching quality. Specifically, we employ adversarial attacks, encouraging the model to generalize on subtly perturbed inputs that effectively deceive the model. To address small objects under poor visibility conditions, we propose a Zoom-in Zoom-out strategy, which zooms-in images for better pseudo-labels and zooms-out images and pseudo-labels to learn refined features. Our results demonstrate that ADT achieves superior performance, reaching 54.5% mAP on Foggy Cityscapes, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 2.6% mAP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaya Kotani, Takeru Oba, Norimichi Ukita</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a depth estimation method using radar-image fusion by addressing the uncertain vertical directions of sparse radar measurements. In prior radar-image fusion work, image features are merged with the uncertain sparse depths measured by radar through convolutional layers. This approach is disturbed by the features computed with the uncertain radar depths. Furthermore, since the features are computed with a fully convolutional network, the uncertainty of each depth corresponding to a pixel is spread out over its surrounding pixels. Our method avoids this problem by computing features only with an image and conditioning the features pixelwise with the radar depth. Furthermore, the set of possibly correct radar directions is identified with reliable LiDAR measurements, which are available only in the training stage. Our method improves training data by learning only these possibly correct radar directions, while the previous method trains raw radar measurements, including erroneous measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can improve the quantitative and qualitative results compared with its base method using radar-image fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce in-context matting, a novel task setting of image matting. Given a reference image of a certain foreground and guided priors such as points, scribbles, and masks, in-context matting enables automatic alpha estimation on a batch of target images of the same foreground category, without additional auxiliary input. This setting marries good performance in auxiliary input-based matting and ease of use in automatic matting, which finds a good trade-off between customization and automation. To overcome the key challenge of accurate foreground matching, we introduce IconMatting, an in-context matting model built upon a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Conditioned on inter- and intra-similarity matching, IconMatting can make full use of reference context to generate accurate target alpha mattes. To benchmark the task, we also introduce a novel testing dataset ICM-$57$, covering 57 groups of real-world images. Quantitative and qualitative results on the ICM-57 testing set show that IconMatting rivals the accuracy of trimap-based matting while retaining the automation level akin to automatic matting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoyu Sun, Chunyang Wang, Xuelian Liu, Chunhao Shi, Yueyang Ding, Guan Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D single object tracking within LIDAR point clouds is a pivotal task in computer vision, with profound implications for autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Video Super Resolution (VSR) is generally trained with randomly clipped and cropped short videos extracted from original training videos due to various challenges in learning RNNs. However, since this RNN is optimized to super-resolve short videos, VSR of long videos is degraded due to the domain gap. Our preliminary experiments reveal that such degradation changes depending on the video properties, such as the video length and dynamics. To avoid this degradation, this paper proposes the training strategy of RNN for VSR that can work efficiently and stably independently of the video length and dynamics. The proposed training strategy stabilizes VSR by training a VSR network with various RNN hidden states changed depending on the video properties. Since computing such a variety of hidden states is time-consuming, this computational cost is reduced by reusing the hidden states for efficient training. In addition, training stability is further improved with frame-number conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performed better than base methods in videos with various lengths and dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hancheng Ye, Chong Yu, Peng Ye, Renqiu Xia, Yansong Tang, Jiwen Lu, Tao Chen, Bo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Vision Transformer Compression (VTC) works mainly follow a two-stage scheme, where the importance score of each model unit is first evaluated or preset in each submodule, followed by the sparsity score evaluation according to the target sparsity constraint. Such a separate evaluation process induces the gap between importance and sparsity score distributions, thus causing high search costs for VTC. In this work, for the first time, we investigate how to integrate the evaluations of importance and sparsity scores into a single stage, searching the optimal subnets in an efficient manner. Specifically, we present OFB, a cost-efficient approach that simultaneously evaluates both importance and sparsity scores, termed Once for Both (OFB), for VTC. First, a bi-mask scheme is developed by entangling the importance score and the differentiable sparsity score to jointly determine the pruning potential (prunability) of each unit. Such a bi-mask search strategy is further used together with a proposed adaptive one-hot loss to realize the progressive-and-efficient search for the most important subnet. Finally, Progressive Masked Image Modeling (PMIM) is proposed to regularize the feature space to be more representative during the search process, which may be degraded by the dimension reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OFB can achieve superior compression performance over state-of-the-art searching-based and pruning-based methods under various Vision Transformer architectures, meanwhile promoting search efficiency significantly, e.g., costing one GPU search day for the compression of DeiT-S on ImageNet-1K.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanfeng Zhong, Xin Liao, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaofan Zhang, Guotai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite that deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance in pathology image classification, they heavily rely on labeled data, demanding extensive human annotation efforts. In this study, we present a novel human annotation-free method for pathology image classification by leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Without human annotation, pseudo labels of the training set are obtained by utilizing the zero-shot inference capabilities of VLM, which may contain a lot of noise due to the domain shift between the pre-training data and the target dataset. To address this issue, we introduce VLM-CPL, a novel approach based on consensus pseudo labels that integrates two noisy label filtering techniques with a semi-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, we first obtain prompt-based pseudo labels with uncertainty estimation by zero-shot inference with the VLM using multiple augmented views of an input. Then, by leveraging the feature representation ability of VLM, we obtain feature-based pseudo labels via sample clustering in the feature space. Prompt-feature consensus is introduced to select reliable samples based on the consensus between the two types of pseudo labels. By rejecting low-quality pseudo labels, we further propose High-confidence Cross Supervision (HCS) to learn from samples with reliable pseudo labels and the remaining unlabeled samples. Experimental results showed that our method obtained an accuracy of 87.1% and 95.1% on the HPH and LC25K datasets, respectively, and it largely outperformed existing zero-shot classification and noisy label learning methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingliang Liang, Martha Larson</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Gaussian masking for Language-Image Pre-Training (GLIP) a novel, straightforward, and effective technique for masking image patches during pre-training of a vision-language model. GLIP builds on Fast Language-Image Pre-Training (FLIP), which randomly masks image patches while training a CLIP model. GLIP replaces random masking with centered masking, that uses a Gaussian distribution and is inspired by the importance of image patches at the center of the image. GLIP retains the same computational savings as FLIP, while improving performance across a range of downstream datasets and tasks, as demonstrated by our experimental results. We show the benefits of GLIP to be easy to obtain, requiring no delicate tuning of the Gaussian, and also applicable to data sets containing images without an obvious center focus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kodai Shimosato, Norimichi Ukita</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a mask optimization method for improving the quality of object removal using image inpainting. While many inpainting methods are trained with a set of random masks, a target for inpainting may be an object, such as a person, in many realistic scenarios. This domain gap between masks in training and inference images increases the difficulty of the inpainting task. In our method, this domain gap is resolved by training the inpainting network with object masks extracted by segmentation, and such object masks are also used in the inference step. Furthermore, to optimize the object masks for inpainting, the segmentation network is connected to the inpainting network and end-to-end trained to improve the inpainting performance. The effect of this end-to-end training is further enhanced by our mask expansion loss for achieving the trade-off between large and small masks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for better object removal using image inpainting.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the ability of Image Captioning (IC) models to decode masked visual content sourced from diverse datasets. Our findings reveal the IC model's capability to generate captions from masked images, closely resembling the original content. Notably, even in the presence of masks, the model adeptly crafts descriptive textual information that goes beyond what is observable in the original image-generated captions. While the decoding performance of the IC model experiences a decline with an increase in the masked region's area, the model still performs well when important regions of the image are not masked at high coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-Wei Liao, Winston Wang, Tzu-Sian Wang, Li-Xuan Peng, Cheng-Fu Chou, Jun-Cheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: QR codes, prevalent in daily applications, lack visual appeal due to their conventional black-and-white design. Integrating aesthetics while maintaining scannability poses a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-model-based aesthetic QR code generation pipeline, utilizing pre-trained ControlNet and guided iterative refinement via a novel classifier guidance (SRG) based on the proposed Scanning-Robust Loss (SRL) tailored with QR code mechanisms, which ensures both aesthetics and scannability. To further improve the scannability while preserving aesthetics, we propose a two-stage pipeline with Scanning-Robust Perceptual Guidance (SRPG). Moreover, we can further enhance the scannability of the generated QR code by post-processing it through the proposed Scanning-Robust Projected Gradient Descent (SRPGD) post-processing technique based on SRL with proven convergence. With extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective experiments, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate diverse aesthetic QR codes with flexibility in detail. In addition, our pipelines outperforming existing models in terms of Scanning Success Rate (SSR) 86.67% (+40%) with comparable aesthetic scores. The pipeline combined with SRPGD further achieves 96.67% (+50%). Our code will be available https://github.com/jwliao1209/DiffQRCode.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate a new task in human motion prediction, which is predicting motions under unexpected physical perturbation potentially involving multiple people. Compared with existing research, this task involves predicting less controlled, unpremeditated and pure reactive motions in response to external impact and how such motions can propagate through people. It brings new challenges such as data scarcity and predicting complex interactions. To this end, we propose a new method capitalizing differential physics and deep neural networks, leading to an explicit Latent Differential Physics (LDP) model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that LDP has high data efficiency, outstanding prediction accuracy, strong generalizability and good explainability. Since there is no similar research, a comprehensive comparison with 11 adapted baselines from several relevant domains is conducted, showing LDP outperforming existing research both quantitatively and qualitatively, improving prediction accuracy by as much as 70%, and demonstrating significantly stronger generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Satpathy,  Nilaksh, Dhruva Rajwade</p>
<p>Abstract: Self Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to tackle data landscapes with absence of human supervision. The ability to learn meaningful tasks without the use of labeled data makes SSL a popular method to manage large chunks of data in the absence of labels. However, recent work indicates SSL to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, wherein models can be controlled, possibly maliciously, to suit an adversary's motives. Li et.al (2022) introduce a novel frequency-based backdoor attack: CTRL. They show that CTRL can be used to efficiently and stealthily gain control over a victim's model trained using SSL. In this work, we devise two defense strategies against frequency-based attacks in SSL: One applicable before model training and the second to be applied during model inference. Our first contribution utilizes the invariance property of the downstream task to defend against backdoor attacks in a generalizable fashion. We observe the ASR (Attack Success Rate) to reduce by over 60% across experiments. Our Inference-time defense relies on evasiveness of the attack and uses the luminance channel to defend against attacks. Using object classification as the downstream task for SSL, we demonstrate successful defense strategies that do not require re-training of the model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Xie, Hongyi Xu, Guoxian Song, Chao Wang, Yichun Shi, Linjie Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose X-Portrait, an innovative conditional diffusion model tailored for generating expressive and temporally coherent portrait animation. Specifically, given a single portrait as appearance reference, we aim to animate it with motion derived from a driving video, capturing both highly dynamic and subtle facial expressions along with wide-range head movements. As its core, we leverage the generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model as the rendering backbone, while achieve fine-grained head pose and expression control with novel controlling signals within the framework of ControlNet. In contrast to conventional coarse explicit controls such as facial landmarks, our motion control module is learned to interpret the dynamics directly from the original driving RGB inputs. The motion accuracy is further enhanced with a patch-based local control module that effectively enhance the motion attention to small-scale nuances like eyeball positions. Notably, to mitigate the identity leakage from the driving signals, we train our motion control modules with scaling-augmented cross-identity images, ensuring maximized disentanglement from the appearance reference modules. Experimental results demonstrate the universal effectiveness of X-Portrait across a diverse range of facial portraits and expressive driving sequences, and showcase its proficiency in generating captivating portrait animations with consistently maintained identity characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglin Li, Yangchen Huang, Mengran Zhu, Jingyu Zhang, JingHao Chang, Houze Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Change Detection is a classic task of computer vision that receives a bi-temporal image pair as input and separates the semantically changed and unchanged regions of it. The diffusion model is used in image synthesis and as a feature extractor and has been applied to various downstream tasks. Using this, a feature map is extracted from the pre-trained diffusion model from the large-scale data set, and changes are detected through the additional network. On the one hand, the current diffusion-based change detection approach focuses only on extracting a good feature map using the diffusion model. It obtains and uses differences without further adjustment to the created feature map. Our method focuses on manipulating the feature map extracted from the Diffusion Model to be more semantically useful, and for this, we propose two methods: Feature Attention and FDAF. Our model with Feature Attention achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score (90.18) and IoU (83.86) on the LEVIR-CD dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luchuan Song, Pinxin Liu, Guojun Yin, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The one-shot talking-head generation learns to synthesize a talking-head video with one source portrait image under the driving of same or different identity video. Usually these methods require plane-based pixel transformations via Jacobin matrices or facial image warps for novel poses generation. The constraints of using a single image source and pixel displacements often compromise the clarity of the synthesized images. Some methods try to improve the quality of synthesized videos by introducing additional super-resolution modules, but this will undoubtedly increase computational consumption and destroy the original data distribution. In this work, we propose an adaptive high-quality talking-head video generation method, which synthesizes high-resolution video without additional pre-trained modules. Specifically, inspired by existing super-resolution methods, we down-sample the one-shot source image, and then adaptively reconstruct high-frequency details via an encoder-decoder module, resulting in enhanced video clarity. Our method consistently improves the quality of generated videos through a straightforward yet effective strategy, substantiated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet Dung Nguyen, Reynold Bailey, Gabriel J. Diaz, Chengyi Ma, Alexander Fix, Alexander Ororbia</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye image segmentation is a critical step in eye tracking that has great influence over the final gaze estimate. Segmentation models trained using supervised machine learning can excel at this task, their effectiveness is determined by the degree of overlap between the narrow distributions of image properties defined by the target dataset and highly specific training datasets, of which there are few. Attempts to broaden the distribution of existing eye image datasets through the inclusion of synthetic eye images have found that a model trained on synthetic images will often fail to generalize back to real-world eye images. In remedy, we use dimensionality-reduction techniques to measure the overlap between the target eye images and synthetic training data, and to prune the training dataset in a manner that maximizes distribution overlap. We demonstrate that our methods result in robust, improved performance when tackling the discrepancy between simulation and real-world data samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Chen, Yuefan Wu, Jiaqi Tan, Hang Ma, Yasutaka Furukawa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a vector HD-mapping algorithm that formulates the mapping as a tracking task and uses a history of memory latents to ensure consistent reconstructions over time. Our method, MapTracker, accumulates a sensor stream into memory buffers of two latent representations: 1) Raster latents in the bird's-eye-view (BEV) space and 2) Vector latents over the road elements (i.e., pedestrian-crossings, lane-dividers, and road-boundaries). The approach borrows the query propagation paradigm from the tracking literature that explicitly associates tracked road elements from the previous frame to the current, while fusing a subset of memory latents selected with distance strides to further enhance temporal consistency. A vector latent is decoded to reconstruct the geometry of a road element. The paper further makes benchmark contributions by 1) Improving processing code for existing datasets to produce consistent ground truth with temporal alignments and 2) Augmenting existing mAP metrics with consistency checks. MapTracker significantly outperforms existing methods on both nuScenes and Agroverse2 datasets by over 8% and 19% on the conventional and the new consistency-aware metrics, respectively.

<p>Abstract: The advent of Vision Language Models (VLM) has allowed researchers to investigate the visual understanding of a neural network using natural language. Beyond object classification and detection, VLMs are capable of visual comprehension and common-sense reasoning. This naturally led to the question: How do VLMs respond when the image itself is inherently unreasonable? To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization. GPT4V, the best-performing VLM, achieves 62.99% accuracy (4-shot) on the comprehension task and 49.7% on the localization task (4-shot and Chain-of-Thought). Human evaluation reveals that humans achieve 91.03% and 100% accuracy in comprehension and localization. We discover that In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning substantially degrade the performance of GeminiPro on the localization task. Tangentially, we discover a potential weakness in the ICL capabilities of VLMs: they fail to locate optical illusions even when the correct answer is in the context window as a few-shot example.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose WaterMark Detection (WMD), the first invisible watermark detection method under a black-box and annotation-free setting. WMD is capable of detecting arbitrary watermarks within a given reference dataset using a clean non-watermarked dataset as a reference, without relying on specific decoding methods or prior knowledge of the watermarking techniques. We develop WMD using foundations of offset learning, where a clean non-watermarked dataset enables us to isolate the influence of only watermarked samples in the reference dataset. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of WMD, significantly outperforming naive detection methods, which only yield AUC scores around 0.5. In contrast, WMD consistently achieves impressive detection AUC scores, surpassing 0.9 in most single-watermark datasets and exceeding 0.7 in more challenging multi-watermark scenarios across diverse datasets and watermarking methods. As invisible watermarks become increasingly prevalent, while specific decoding techniques remain undisclosed, our approach provides a versatile solution and establishes a path toward increasing accountability, transparency, and trust in our digital visual content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timur Ibrayev, Amitangshu Mukherjee, Sai Aparna Aketi, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) based machine perception frameworks process the entire input in a one-shot manner to provide answers to both "what object is being observed" and "where it is located". In contrast, the "two-stream hypothesis" from neuroscience explains the neural processing in the human visual cortex as an active vision system that utilizes two separate regions of the brain to answer the what and the where questions. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework inspired by the "two-stream hypothesis" and explore the potential benefits that it offers. Specifically, the proposed framework models the following mechanisms: 1) ventral (what) stream focusing on the input regions perceived by the fovea part of an eye (foveation), 2) dorsal (where) stream providing visual guidance, and 3) iterative processing of the two streams to calibrate visual focus and process the sequence of focused image patches. The training of the proposed framework is accomplished by label-based DNN training for the ventral stream model and reinforcement learning for the dorsal stream model. We show that the two-stream foveation-based learning is applicable to the challenging task of weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where the training data is limited to the object class or its attributes. The framework is capable of both predicting the properties of an object and successfully localizing it by predicting its bounding box. We also show that, due to the independent nature of the two streams, the dorsal model can be applied on its own to unseen images to localize objects from different datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate collection of plant phenotyping is critical to optimising sustainable farming practices in precision agriculture. Traditional phenotyping in controlled laboratory environments, while valuable, falls short in understanding plant growth under real-world conditions. Emerging sensor and digital technologies offer a promising approach for direct phenotyping of plants in farm environments. This study investigates a learning-based phenotyping method using the Neural Radiance Field to achieve accurate in-situ phenotyping of pepper plants in greenhouse environments. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of this method, traditional point cloud registration on 3D scanning data is implemented for comparison. Experimental result shows that NeRF(Neural Radiance Fields) achieves competitive accuracy compared to the 3D scanning methods. The mean distance error between the scanner-based method and the NeRF-based method is 0.865mm. This study shows that the learning-based NeRF method achieves similar accuracy to 3D scanning-based methods but with improved scalability and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The burgeoning integration of 3D medical imaging into healthcare has led to a substantial increase in the workload of medical professionals. To assist clinicians in their diagnostic processes and alleviate their workload, the development of a robust system for retrieving similar case studies presents a viable solution. While the concept holds great promise, the field of 3D medical text-image retrieval is currently limited by the absence of robust evaluation benchmarks and curated datasets. To remedy this, our study presents a groundbreaking dataset, BIMCV-R (This dataset will be released upon acceptance.), which includes an extensive collection of 8,069 3D CT volumes, encompassing over 2 million slices, paired with their respective radiological reports. Expanding upon the foundational work of our dataset, we craft a retrieval strategy, MedFinder. This approach employs a dual-stream network architecture, harnessing the potential of large language models to advance the field of medical image retrieval beyond existing text-image retrieval solutions. It marks our preliminary step towards developing a system capable of facilitating text-to-image, image-to-text, and keyword-based retrieval tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Facial expression spotting is a significant but challenging task in facial expression analysis. The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16002">SDSTrack: Self-Distillation Symmetric Adapter Learning for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojun Hou, Jiazheng Xing, Yijie Qian, Yaowei Guo, Shuo Xin, Junhao Chen, Kai Tang, Mengmeng Wang, Zhengkai Jiang, Liang Liu, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Visual Object Tracking (VOT) has recently gained significant attention due to its robustness. Early research focused on fully fine-tuning RGB-based trackers, which was inefficient and lacked generalized representation due to the scarcity of multimodal data. Therefore, recent studies have utilized prompt tuning to transfer pre-trained RGB-based trackers to multimodal data. However, the modality gap limits pre-trained knowledge recall, and the dominance of the RGB modality persists, preventing the full utilization of information from other modalities. To address these issues, we propose a novel symmetric multimodal tracking framework called SDSTrack. We introduce lightweight adaptation for efficient fine-tuning, which directly transfers the feature extraction ability from RGB to other domains with a small number of trainable parameters and integrates multimodal features in a balanced, symmetric manner. Furthermore, we design a complementary masked patch distillation strategy to enhance the robustness of trackers in complex environments, such as extreme weather, poor imaging, and sensor failure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDSTrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various multimodal tracking scenarios, including RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal, and RGB+Event tracking, and exhibits impressive results in extreme conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiben Liu, Huijie Fan, Qiang Wang, Xiai Chen, Zhi Han, Yandong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong Person Re-Identification (LReID) aims to continuously learn from successive data streams, matching individuals across multiple cameras. The key challenge for LReID is how to effectively preserve old knowledge while learning new information incrementally. Task-level domain gaps and limited old task datasets are key factors leading to catastrophic forgetting in ReLD, which are overlooked in existing methods. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Diverse Representation Embedding (DRE) framework for LReID. The proposed DRE preserves old knowledge while adapting to new information based on instance-level and task-level layout. Concretely, an Adaptive Constraint Module (ACM) is proposed to implement integration and push away operations between multiple representations, obtaining dense embedding subspace for each instance to improve matching ability on limited old task datasets. Based on the processed diverse representation, we interact knowledge between the adjustment model and the learner model through Knowledge Update (KU) and Knowledge Preservation (KP) strategies at the task-level layout, which reduce the task-wise domain gap on both old and new tasks, and exploit diverse representation of each instance in limited datasets from old tasks, improving model performance for extended periods. Extensive experiments were conducted on eleven Re-ID datasets, including five seen datasets for training in order-1 and order-2 orders and six unseen datasets for inference. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves significantly improved performance in holistic, large-scale, and occluded datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Suo, Fan Ma, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) task, which is to retrieve the target image given a reference image and a description without training on the triplet datasets. Previous works generate pseudo-word tokens by projecting the reference image features to the text embedding space. However, they focus on the global visual representation, ignoring the representation of detailed attributes, e.g., color, object number and layout. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Dual-stream zero-shot composed image retrieval framework (KEDs). KEDs implicitly models the attributes of the reference images by incorporating a database. The database enriches the pseudo-word tokens by providing relevant images and captions, emphasizing shared attribute information in various aspects. In this way, KEDs recognizes the reference image from diverse perspectives. Moreover, KEDs adopts an extra stream that aligns pseudo-word tokens with textual concepts, leveraging pseudo-triplets mined from image-text pairs. The pseudo-word tokens generated in this stream are explicitly aligned with fine-grained semantics in the text embedding space. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, i.e. ImageNet-R, COCO object, Fashion-IQ and CIRR, show that KEDs outperforms previous zero-shot composed image retrieval methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Wang, Chuhong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, machine learning-based semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated their potential to accurately segment regions and contours in medical images, allowing the precise location of anatomical structures and abnormalities. Although medical images are difficult to acquire and annotate, semi-supervised learning methods are efficient in dealing with the scarcity of labeled data. However, overfitting is almost inevitable due to the limited images for training. Furthermore, the intricate shapes of organs and lesions in medical images introduce additional complexity in different cases, preventing networks from acquiring a strong ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce a novel method called Scaling-up Mix with Multi-Class (SM2C). This method uses three strategies - scaling-up image size, multi-class mixing, and object shape jittering - to improve the ability to learn semantic features within medical images. By diversifying the shape of the segmentation objects and enriching the semantic information within each sample, the SM2C demonstrates its potential, especially in the training of unlabelled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the SM2C on three benchmark medical image segmentation datasets. The proposed framework shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyoel Gebre, Krishna Saxena, Timothy Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Image inpainting is the process of taking an image and generating lost or intentionally occluded portions. Inpainting has countless applications including restoring previously damaged pictures, restoring the quality of images that have been degraded due to compression, and removing unwanted objects/text. Modern inpainting techniques have shown remarkable ability in generating sensible completions for images with mask occlusions. In our paper, an overview of the progress of inpainting techniques will be provided, along with identifying current leading approaches, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses. A critical gap in these existing models will be addressed, focusing on the ability to prompt and control what exactly is generated. We will additionally justify why we think this is the natural next progressive step that inpainting models must take, and provide multiple approaches to implementing this functionality. Finally, we will evaluate the results of our approaches by qualitatively checking whether they generate high-quality images that correctly inpaint regions with the objects that they are instructed to produce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanvir Mahmud, Burhaneddin Yaman, Chun-Hao Liu, Diana Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep neural networks evolve from convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to advanced vision transformers (ViTs), there is an increased need to eliminate redundant data for faster processing without compromising accuracy. Previous methods are often architecture-specific or necessitate re-training, restricting their applicability with frequent model updates. To solve this, we first introduce a novel property of lightweight ConvNets: their ability to identify key discriminative patch regions in images, irrespective of model's final accuracy or size. We demonstrate that fully-connected layers are the primary bottleneck for ConvNets performance, and their suppression with simple weight recalibration markedly enhances discriminative patch localization performance. Using this insight, we introduce PaPr, a method for substantially pruning redundant patches with minimal accuracy loss using lightweight ConvNets across a variety of deep learning architectures, including ViTs, ConvNets, and hybrid transformers, without any re-training. Moreover, the simple early-stage one-step patch pruning with PaPr enhances existing patch reduction methods. Through extensive testing on diverse architectures, PaPr achieves significantly higher accuracy over state-of-the-art patch reduction methods with similar FLOP count reduction. More specifically, PaPr reduces about 70% of redundant patches in videos with less than 0.8% drop in accuracy, and up to 3.7x FLOPs reduction, which is a 15% more reduction with 2.5% higher accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16028">Exploring the Impact of Dataset Bias on Dataset Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Lu, Jianyang Gu, Xuguang Chen, Saeed Vahidian, Qi Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) is a promising technique to synthesize a smaller dataset that preserves essential information from the original dataset. This synthetic dataset can serve as a substitute for the original large-scale one, and help alleviate the training workload. However, current DD methods typically operate under the assumption that the dataset is unbiased, overlooking potential bias issues within the dataset itself. To fill in this blank, we systematically investigate the influence of dataset bias on DD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration in the DD domain. Given that there are no suitable biased datasets for DD, we first construct two biased datasets, CMNIST-DD and CCIFAR10-DD, to establish a foundation for subsequent analysis. Then we utilize existing DD methods to generate synthetic datasets on CMNIST-DD and CCIFAR10-DD, and evaluate their performance following the standard process. Experiments demonstrate that biases present in the original dataset significantly impact the performance of the synthetic dataset in most cases, which highlights the necessity of identifying and mitigating biases in the original datasets during DD. Finally, we reformulate DD within the context of a biased dataset. Our code along with biased datasets are available at https://github.com/yaolu-zjut/Biased-DD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies have enabled autonomous vehicles to share sensing information to see through occlusions, greatly boosting the perception capability. However, there are no real-world datasets to facilitate the real V2X cooperative perception research -- existing datasets either only support Vehicle-to-Infrastructure cooperation or Vehicle-to-Vehicle cooperation. In this paper, we propose a dataset that has a mixture of multiple vehicles and smart infrastructure simultaneously to facilitate the V2X cooperative perception development with multi-modality sensing data. Our V2X-Real is collected using two connected automated vehicles and two smart infrastructures, which are all equipped with multi-modal sensors including LiDAR sensors and multi-view cameras. The whole dataset contains 33K LiDAR frames and 171K camera data with over 1.2M annotated bounding boxes of 10 categories in very challenging urban scenarios. According to the collaboration mode and ego perspective, we derive four types of datasets for Vehicle-Centric, Infrastructure-Centric, Vehicle-to-Vehicle, and Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure cooperative perception. Comprehensive multi-class multi-agent benchmarks of SOTA cooperative perception methods are provided. The V2X-Real dataset and benchmark codes will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibo Wang, Song Zhang, Ping Huang, Donghai Zhang, Wei Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research that combines implicit 3D representation with semantic information, like Semantic-NeRF, has proven that NeRF model could perform excellently in rendering 3D structures with semantic labels. This research aims to extend the Semantic Neural Radiance Fields (Semantic-NeRF) model by focusing solely on semantic output and removing the RGB output component. We reformulate the model and its training procedure to leverage only the cross-entropy loss between the model semantic output and the ground truth semantic images, removing the colour data traditionally used in the original Semantic-NeRF approach. We then conduct a series of identical experiments using the original and the modified Semantic-NeRF model. Our primary objective is to obverse the impact of this modification on the model performance by Semantic-NeRF, focusing on tasks such as scene understanding, object detection, and segmentation. The results offer valuable insights into the new way of rendering the scenes and provide an avenue for further research and development in semantic-focused 3D scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Gu, Libo Zhang, Fan Chen, Longyin Wen, Yufei Wang, Tiejian Luo, Sijie Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on understanding the predominant video creation pipeline, i.e., compositional video editing with six main types of editing components, including video effects, animation, transition, filter, sticker, and text. In contrast to existing visual representation learning of visual materials (i.e., images/videos), we aim to learn visual representations of editing actions/components that are generally applied on raw materials. We start by proposing the first large-scale dataset for editing components of video creation, which covers about $3,094$ editing components with $618,800$ videos. Each video in our dataset is rendered by various image/video materials with a single editing component, which supports atomic visual understanding of different editing components. It can also benefit several downstream tasks, e.g., editing component recommendation, editing component recognition/retrieval, etc. Existing visual representation methods perform poorly because it is difficult to disentangle the visual appearance of editing components from raw materials. To that end, we benchmark popular alternative solutions and propose a novel method that learns to attend to the appearance of editing components regardless of raw materials. Our method achieves favorable results on editing component retrieval/recognition compared to the alternative solutions. A user study is also conducted to show that our representations cluster visually similar editing components better than other alternatives. Furthermore, our learned representations used to transition recommendation tasks achieve state-of-the-art results on the AutoTransition dataset. The code and dataset will be released for academic use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Shi, Yuhui Zhang, Ziyue Huang, Xiaofeng Yang, Li Shen, Wei Chen, Xueqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Split Learning (FSL) is a promising distributed learning paradigm in practice, which gathers the strengths of both Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) paradigms, to ensure model privacy while diminishing the resource overhead of each client, especially on large transformer models in a resource-constrained environment, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT). However, almost all works merely investigate the performance with simple neural network models in FSL. Despite the minor efforts focusing on incorporating Vision Transformers (ViT) as model architectures, they train ViT from scratch, thereby leading to enormous training overhead in each device with limited resources. Therefore, in this paper, we harness Pre-trained Image Transformers (PITs) as the initial model, coined FES-PIT, to accelerate the training process and improve model robustness. Furthermore, we propose FES-PTZO to hinder the gradient inversion attack, especially having the capability compatible with black-box scenarios, where the gradient information is unavailable. Concretely, FES-PTZO approximates the server gradient by utilizing a zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, which replaces the backward propagation with just one forward process. Empirically, we are the first to provide a systematic evaluation of FSL methods with PITs in real-world datasets, different partial device participations, and heterogeneous data splits. Our experiments verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose SAM-Road, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for extracting large-scale, vectorized road network graphs from satellite imagery. To predict graph geometry, we formulate it as a dense semantic segmentation task, leveraging the inherent strengths of SAM. The image encoder of SAM is fine-tuned to produce probability masks for roads and intersections, from which the graph vertices are extracted via simple non-maximum suppression. To predict graph topology, we designed a lightweight transformer-based graph neural network, which leverages the SAM image embeddings to estimate the edge existence probabilities between vertices. Our approach directly predicts the graph vertices and edges for large regions without expensive and complex post-processing heuristics, and is capable of building complete road network graphs spanning multiple square kilometers in a matter of seconds. With its simple, straightforward, and minimalist design, SAM-Road achieves comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art method RNGDet++, while being 40 times faster on the City-scale dataset. We thus demonstrate the power of a foundational vision model when applied to a graph learning task. The code is available at https://github.com/htcr/sam_road.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Lin, Zerui Tao, Jianhai Zhang, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) based adversarial purification (AP) has shown to be the most powerful alternative to adversarial training (AT). However, these methods neglect the fact that pre-trained diffusion models themselves are not robust to adversarial attacks as well. Additionally, the diffusion process can easily destroy semantic information and generate a high quality image but totally different from the original input image after the reverse process, leading to degraded standard accuracy. To overcome these issues, a natural idea is to harness adversarial training strategy to retrain or fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, which is computationally prohibitive. We propose a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance, which is independent of given pre-trained DMs and avoids retraining or fine-tuning the DMs. This robust guidance can not only ensure to generate purified examples retaining more semantic content but also mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off of DMs for the first time, which also provides DM-based AP an efficient adaptive ability to new attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization against different attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality human reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering of a dynamic scene is a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Despite considerable efforts invested in developing various capture systems and reconstruction algorithms, recent advancements still struggle with loose or oversized clothing and overly complex poses. In part, this is due to the challenges of acquiring high-quality human datasets. To facilitate the development of these fields, in this paper, we present PKU-DyMVHumans, a versatile human-centric dataset for high-fidelity reconstruction and rendering of dynamic human scenarios from dense multi-view videos. It comprises 8.2 million frames captured by more than 56 synchronized cameras across diverse scenarios. These sequences comprise 32 human subjects across 45 different scenarios, each with a high-detailed appearance and realistic human motion. Inspired by recent advancements in neural radiance field (NeRF)-based scene representations, we carefully set up an off-the-shelf framework that is easy to provide those state-of-the-art NeRF-based implementations and benchmark on PKU-DyMVHumans dataset. It is paving the way for various applications like fine-grained foreground/background decomposition, high-quality human reconstruction and photo-realistic novel view synthesis of a dynamic scene.

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as promising tools for advancing autonomous driving (AD) research, offering scalable closed-loop simulation and data augmentation capabilities. However, to trust the results achieved in simulation, one needs to ensure that AD systems perceive real and rendered data in the same way. Although the performance of rendering methods is increasing, many scenarios will remain inherently challenging to reconstruct faithfully. To this end, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the real-to-simulated data gap. Rather than solely focusing on improving rendering fidelity, we explore simple yet effective methods to enhance perception model robustness to NeRF artifacts without compromising performance on real data. Moreover, we conduct the first large-scale investigation into the real-to-simulated data gap in an AD setting using a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Specifically, we evaluate object detectors and an online mapping model on real and simulated data, and study the effects of different pre-training strategies. Our results show notable improvements in model robustness to simulated data, even improving real-world performance in some cases. Last, we delve into the correlation between the real-to-simulated gap and image reconstruction metrics, identifying FID and LPIPS as strong indicators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been widely exploited as 3D representations for dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Despite their notable successes in surface modeling and novel view synthesis, existing NeRF-based methods are hindered by their computationally intensive and time-consuming volume rendering pipeline. This paper presents an efficient dense RGB-D SLAM system, i.e., CG-SLAM, based on a novel uncertainty-aware 3D Gaussian field with high consistency and geometric stability. Through an in-depth analysis of Gaussian Splatting, we propose several techniques to construct a consistent and stable 3D Gaussian field suitable for tracking and mapping. Additionally, a novel depth uncertainty model is proposed to ensure the selection of valuable Gaussian primitives during optimization, thereby improving tracking efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CG-SLAM achieves superior tracking and mapping performance with a notable tracking speed of up to 15 Hz.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16111">EVA: Zero-shot Accurate Attributes and Multi-Object Video Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangpeng Yang, Linchao Zhu, Hehe Fan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current diffusion-based video editing primarily focuses on local editing (\textit{e.g.,} object/background editing) or global style editing by utilizing various dense correspondences. However, these methods often fail to accurately edit the foreground and background simultaneously while preserving the original layout. We find that the crux of the issue stems from the imprecise distribution of attention weights across designated regions, including inaccurate text-to-attribute control and attention leakage. To tackle this issue, we introduce EVA, a \textbf{zero-shot} and \textbf{multi-attribute} video editing framework tailored for human-centric videos with complex motions. We incorporate a Spatial-Temporal Layout-Guided Attention mechanism that leverages the intrinsic positive and negative correspondences of cross-frame diffusion features. To avoid attention leakage, we utilize these correspondences to boost the attention scores of tokens within the same attribute across all video frames while limiting interactions between tokens of different attributes in the self-attention layer. For precise text-to-attribute manipulation, we use discrete text embeddings focused on specific layout areas within the cross-attention layer. Benefiting from the precise attention weight distribution, EVA can be easily generalized to multi-object editing scenarios and achieves accurate identity mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate EVA achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world scenarios. Full results are provided at https://knightyxp.github.io/EVA/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongrui Liu, Daqi Liu, Xueqian Li, Sihao Lin, Hongwei xie, Bing Wang, Xiaojun Chang, Lei Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Scene Flow Prior (NSFP) and Fast Neural Scene Flow (FNSF) have shown remarkable adaptability in the context of large out-of-distribution autonomous driving. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their astonishing generalization capabilities remain unclear. Our research addresses this gap by examining the generalization capabilities of NSFP through the lens of uniform stability, revealing that its performance is inversely proportional to the number of input point clouds. This finding sheds light on NSFP's effectiveness in handling large-scale point cloud scene flow estimation tasks. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we further explore the improvement of scene flow estimation by leveraging historical point clouds across multiple frames, which inherently increases the number of point clouds. Consequently, we propose a simple and effective method for multi-frame point cloud scene flow estimation, along with a theoretical evaluation of its generalization abilities. Our analysis confirms that the proposed method maintains a limited generalization error, suggesting that adding multiple frames to the scene flow optimization process does not detract from its generalizability. Extensive experimental results on large-scale autonomous driving Waymo Open and Argoverse lidar datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bolin Ni, Hongbo Zhao, Chenghao Zhang, Ke Hu, Gaofeng Meng, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Shiming Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to empower models to learn new tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Most prior works concentrate on the techniques of architectures, replay data, regularization, \etc. However, the category name of each class is largely neglected. Existing methods commonly utilize the one-hot labels and randomly initialize the classifier head. We argue that the scarce semantic information conveyed by the one-hot labels hampers the effective knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we revisit the role of the classifier head within the CL paradigm and replace the classifier with semantic knowledge from pretrained language models (PLMs). Specifically, we use PLMs to generate semantic targets for each class, which are frozen and serve as supervision signals during training. Such targets fully consider the semantic correlation between all classes across tasks. Empirical studies show that our approach mitigates forgetting by alleviating representation drifting and facilitating knowledge transfer across tasks. The proposed method is simple to implement and can seamlessly be plugged into existing methods with negligible adjustments. Extensive experiments based on eleven mainstream baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach to various protocols. For example, under the class-incremental learning setting on ImageNet-100, our method significantly improves the Top-1 accuracy by 3.2\% to 6.1\% while reducing the forgetting rate by 2.6\% to 13.1\%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16128">Enhancing Video Transformers for Action Understanding with VLM-aided Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Lu, Hu Jian, Ronald Poppe, Albert Ali Salah</p>
<p>Abstract: Owing to their ability to extract relevant spatio-temporal video embeddings, Vision Transformers (ViTs) are currently the best performing models in video action understanding. However, their generalization over domains or datasets is somewhat limited. In contrast, Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional generalization performance, but are currently unable to process videos. Consequently, they cannot extract spatio-temporal patterns that are crucial for action understanding. In this paper, we propose the Four-tiered Prompts (FTP) framework that takes advantage of the complementary strengths of ViTs and VLMs. We retain ViTs' strong spatio-temporal representation ability but improve the visual encodings to be more comprehensive and general by aligning them with VLM outputs. The FTP framework adds four feature processors that focus on specific aspects of human action in videos: action category, action components, action description, and context information. The VLMs are only employed during training, and inference incurs a minimal computation cost. Our approach consistently yields state-of-the-art performance. For instance, we achieve remarkable top-1 accuracy of 93.8% on Kinetics-400 and 83.4% on Something-Something V2, surpassing VideoMAEv2 by 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16131">Salience DETR: Enhancing Detection Transformer with Hierarchical Salience Filtering Refinement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuquan Hou, Meiqin Liu, Senlin Zhang, Ping Wei, Badong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: DETR-like methods have significantly increased detection performance in an end-to-end manner. The mainstream two-stage frameworks of them perform dense self-attention and select a fraction of queries for sparse cross-attention, which is proven effective for improving performance but also introduces a heavy computational burden and high dependence on stable query selection. This paper demonstrates that suboptimal two-stage selection strategies result in scale bias and redundancy due to the mismatch between selected queries and objects in two-stage initialization. To address these issues, we propose hierarchical salience filtering refinement, which performs transformer encoding only on filtered discriminative queries, for a better trade-off between computational efficiency and precision. The filtering process overcomes scale bias through a novel scale-independent salience supervision. To compensate for the semantic misalignment among queries, we introduce elaborate query refinement modules for stable two-stage initialization. Based on above improvements, the proposed Salience DETR achieves significant improvements of +4.0% AP, +0.2% AP, +4.4% AP on three challenging task-specific detection datasets, as well as 49.2% AP on COCO 2017 with less FLOPs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Otonari, Satoshi Ikehata, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in the study of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic scenes often involve explicit modeling of scene dynamics. However, this approach faces challenges in modeling scene dynamics in urban environments, where moving objects of various categories and scales are present. In such settings, it becomes crucial to effectively eliminate moving objects to accurately reconstruct static backgrounds. Our research introduces an innovative method, termed here as Entity-NeRF, which combines the strengths of knowledge-based and statistical strategies. This approach utilizes entity-wise statistics, leveraging entity segmentation and stationary entity classification through thing/stuff segmentation. To assess our methodology, we created an urban scene dataset masked with moving objects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Entity-NeRF notably outperforms existing techniques in removing moving objects and reconstructing static urban backgrounds, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillaume Thiry, Hao Tang, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: Video inpainting tasks have seen significant improvements in recent years with the rise of deep neural networks and, in particular, vision transformers. Although these models show promising reconstruction quality and temporal consistency, they are still unsuitable for live videos, one of the last steps to make them completely convincing and usable. The main limitations are that these state-of-the-art models inpaint using the whole video (offline processing) and show an insufficient frame rate. In our approach, we propose a framework to adapt existing inpainting transformers to these constraints by memorizing and refining redundant computations while maintaining a decent inpainting quality. Using this framework with some of the most recent inpainting models, we show great online results with a consistent throughput above 20 frames per second. The code and pretrained models will be made available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minchan Kim, Minyeong Kim, Junik Bae, Suhwan Choi, Sungkyung Kim, Buru Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models pose a significant challenge to their reliability, particularly in the generation of long captions. Current methods fall short of accurately identifying and mitigating these hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce ESREAL, a novel unsupervised learning framework designed to suppress the generation of hallucinations through accurate localization and penalization of hallucinated tokens. Initially, ESREAL creates a reconstructed image based on the generated caption and aligns its corresponding regions with those of the original image. This semantic reconstruction aids in identifying both the presence and type of token-level hallucinations within the generated caption. Subsequently, ESREAL computes token-level hallucination scores by assessing the semantic similarity of aligned regions based on the type of hallucination. Finally, ESREAL employs a proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes hallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores. Our framework notably reduces hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2 by 32.81%, 27.08%, and 7.46% on the CHAIR metric. This improvement is achieved solely through signals derived from the image itself, without the need for any image-text pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Tian, Lingxiao Yang, Ran Ji, Yuexin Ma, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu, Ye Shi, Jingya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze plays a crucial role in revealing human attention and intention, shedding light on the cognitive processes behind human actions. The integration of gaze guidance with the dynamics of hand-object interactions boosts the accuracy of human motion prediction. However, the lack of datasets that capture the intricate relationship and consistency among gaze, hand, and object movements remains a substantial hurdle. In this paper, we introduce the first Gaze-guided Hand-Object Interaction dataset, GazeHOI, and present a novel task for synthesizing gaze-guided hand-object interactions. Our dataset, GazeHOI, features simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hand, and object interactions, comprising 479 sequences with an average duration of 19.1 seconds, 812 sub-sequences, and 33 objects of various sizes. We propose a hierarchical framework centered on a gaze-guided hand-object interaction diffusion model, named GHO-Diffusion. In the pre-diffusion phase, we separate gaze conditions into spatial-temporal features and goal pose conditions at different levels of information granularity. During the diffusion phase, two gaze-conditioned diffusion models are stacked to simplify the complex synthesis of hand-object motions. Here, the object motion diffusion model generates sequences of object motions based on gaze conditions, while the hand motion diffusion model produces hand motions based on the generated object motion. To improve fine-grained goal pose alignment, we introduce a Spherical Gaussian constraint to guide the denoising step. In the subsequent post-diffusion phase, we optimize the generated hand motions using contact consistency. Our extensive experiments highlight the uniqueness of our dataset and the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuf Artan, Bensu Alkan Semiz</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent fingerprints are one of the most widely used forensic evidence by law enforcement agencies. However, latent recognition performance is far from the exemplary performance of sensor fingerprint recognition due to deformations and artifacts within these images. In this study, we propose a fusion based local matching approach towards latent fingerprint recognition. Recent latent recognition studies typically relied on local descriptor generation methods, in which either handcrafted minutiae features or deep neural network features are extracted around a minutia of interest, in the latent recognition process. Proposed approach would integrate these handcrafted features with a recently proposed deep neural network embedding features in a multi-stage fusion approach to significantly improve latent recognition results. Effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown on several public and private data sets. As demonstrated in our experimental results, proposed method improves rank-1 identification accuracy by considerably for real-world datasets when compared to either the single usage of these features or existing state-of-the-art methods in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Being able to map the activities of others into one's own point of view is one fundamental human skill even from a very early age. Taking a step toward understanding this human ability, we introduce EgoExoLearn, a large-scale dataset that emulates the human demonstration following process, in which individuals record egocentric videos as they execute tasks guided by demonstration videos. Focusing on the potential applications in daily assistance and professional support, EgoExoLearn contains egocentric and demonstration video data spanning 120 hours captured in daily life scenarios and specialized laboratories. Along with the videos we record high-quality gaze data and provide detailed multimodal annotations, formulating a playground for modeling the human ability to bridge asynchronous procedural actions from different viewpoints. To this end, we present benchmarks such as cross-view association, cross-view action planning, and cross-view referenced skill assessment, along with detailed analysis. We expect EgoExoLearn can serve as an important resource for bridging the actions across views, thus paving the way for creating AI agents capable of seamlessly learning by observing humans in the real world.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16184">Improving Scene Graph Generation with Relation Words&#x27; Debiasing in Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wang, Xiaoyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) provides basic language representation of visual scenes, requiring models to grasp complex and diverse semantics between various objects. However, this complexity and diversity in SGG also leads to underrepresentation, where part of test triplets are rare or even unseen during training, resulting in imprecise predictions. To tackle this, we propose using the SGG models with pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance representation. However, due to the gap between the pretraining and SGG, directly ensembling the pretrained VLMs leads to severe biases across relation words. Thus, we introduce LM Estimation to approximate the words' distribution underlies in the pretraining language sets, and then use the distribution for debiasing. After that, we ensemble VLMs with SGG models to enhance representation. Considering that each model may represent better at different samples, we use a certainty-aware indicator to score each sample and dynamically adjust the ensemble weights. Our method effectively addresses the words biases, enhances SGG's representation, and achieve markable performance enhancements. It is training-free and integrates well with existing SGG models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Shangguan, Daniel Seita, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal feature extraction and integration have led to steady performance improvements in few-shot learning tasks due to generating richer features. However, existing multi-modal object detection (MM-OD) methods degrade when facing significant domain-shift and are sample insufficient. We hypothesize that rich text information could more effectively help the model to build a knowledge relationship between the vision instance and its language description and can help mitigate domain shift. Specifically, we study the Cross-Domain few-shot generalization of MM-OD (CDMM-FSOD) and propose a meta-learning based multi-modal few-shot object detection method that utilizes rich text semantic information as an auxiliary modality to achieve domain adaptation in the context of FSOD. Our proposed network contains (i) a multi-modal feature aggregation module that aligns the vision and language support feature embeddings and (ii) a rich text semantic rectify module that utilizes bidirectional text feature generation to reinforce multi-modal feature alignment and thus to enhance the model's language understanding capability. We evaluate our model on common standard cross-domain object detection datasets and demonstrate that our approach considerably outperforms existing FSOD methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised landmarks discovery (ULD) for an object category is a challenging computer vision problem. In pursuit of developing a robust ULD framework, we explore the potential of a recent paradigm of self-supervised learning algorithms, known as diffusion models. Some recent works have shown that these models implicitly contain important correspondence cues. Towards harnessing the potential of diffusion models for the ULD task, we make the following core contributions. First, we propose a ZeroShot ULD baseline based on simple clustering of random pixel locations with nearest neighbour matching. It delivers better results than existing ULD methods. Second, motivated by the ZeroShot performance, we develop a ULD algorithm based on diffusion features using self-training and clustering which also outperforms prior methods by notable margins. Third, we introduce a new proxy task based on generating latent pose codes and also propose a two-stage clustering mechanism to facilitate effective pseudo-labeling, resulting in a significant performance improvement. Overall, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four challenging benchmarks AFLW, MAFL, CatHeads and LS3D by significant margins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqiao Fan, Jianfei Yang, Yuecong Xu, Lihua Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) from Radio Frequency vision (RF-vision) performs human sensing using RF signals that penetrate obstacles without revealing privacy (e.g., facial information). Recently, mmWave radar has emerged as a promising RF-vision sensor, providing radar point clouds by processing RF signals. However, the mmWave radar has a limited resolution with severe noise, leading to inaccurate and inconsistent human pose estimation. This work proposes mmDiff, a novel diffusion-based pose estimator tailored for noisy radar data. Our approach aims to provide reliable guidance as conditions to diffusion models. Two key challenges are addressed by mmDiff: (1) miss-detection of parts of human bodies, which is addressed by a module that isolates feature extraction from different body parts, and (2) signal inconsistency due to environmental interference, which is tackled by incorporating prior knowledge of body structure and motion. Several modules are designed to achieve these goals, whose features work as the conditions for the subsequent diffusion model, eliminating the miss-detection and instability of HPE based on RF-vision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmDiff outperforms existing methods significantly, achieving state-of-the-art performances on public datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biometric authentication, which utilizes contactless features, such as forehead patterns, has become increasingly important for identity verification and access management. The proposed method is based on learning a 3D spatio-spatial temporal convolution to create detailed pictures of forehead patterns. We introduce a new CNN model called the Forehead Spatio-Spatial Temporal Network (FH-SSTNet), which utilizes a 3D CNN architecture with triplet loss to capture distinguishing features. We enhance the model's discrimination capability using Arcloss in the network's head. Experimentation on the Forehead Creases version 1 (FH-V1) dataset, containing 247 unique subjects, demonstrates the superior performance of FH-SSTNet compared to existing methods and pre-trained CNNs like ResNet50, especially for forehead-based user verification. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FH-SSTNet for forehead-based user verification, confirming its effectiveness in identity authentication.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework designed to train an image deblurring algorithm tailored to a specific camera device. This algorithm works by transforming a blurry input image, which is challenging to deblur, into another blurry image that is more amenable to deblurring. The transformation process, from one blurry state to another, leverages unpaired data consisting of sharp and blurry images captured by the target camera device. Learning this blur-to-blur transformation is inherently simpler than direct blur-to-sharp conversion, as it primarily involves modifying blur patterns rather than the intricate task of reconstructing fine image details. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqing Liang, Congyi Zhang, Junli Zhao, Wenping Wang, Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deducing the 3D face from a skull is an essential but challenging task in forensic science and archaeology. Existing methods for automated facial reconstruction yield inaccurate results, suffering from the non-determinative nature of the problem that a skull with a sparse set of tissue depth cannot fully determine the skinned face. Additionally, their texture-less results require further post-processing stages to achieve a photo-realistic appearance. This paper proposes an end-to-end 3D face reconstruction and exploration tool, providing textured 3D faces for reference. With the help of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and image-based facial reconstruction techniques, we generate an initial reference 3D face, whose biological profile aligns with the given skull. We then adapt these initial faces to meet the statistical expectations of extruded anatomical landmarks on the skull through an optimization process. The joint statistical distribution of tissue depths is learned on a small set of anatomical landmarks on the skull. To support further adjustment, we propose an efficient face adaptation tool to assist users in tuning tissue depths, either globally or at local regions, while observing plausible visual feedback. Experiments conducted on a real skull-face dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in terms of reconstruction accuracy, diversity, and stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yan, Yang Li, Zhennan Wu, Shenzhou Chen, Weixuan Sun, Taizhang Shang, Weizhe Liu, Tian Chen, Xiaqiang Dai, Chao Ma, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Frankenstein, a diffusion-based framework that can generate semantic-compositional 3D scenes in a single pass. Unlike existing methods that output a single, unified 3D shape, Frankenstein simultaneously generates multiple separated shapes, each corresponding to a semantically meaningful part. The 3D scene information is encoded in one single tri-plane tensor, from which multiple Singed Distance Function (SDF) fields can be decoded to represent the compositional shapes. During training, an auto-encoder compresses tri-planes into a latent space, and then the denoising diffusion process is employed to approximate the distribution of the compositional scenes. Frankenstein demonstrates promising results in generating room interiors as well as human avatars with automatically separated parts. The generated scenes facilitate many downstream applications, such as part-wise re-texturing, object rearrangement in the room or avatar cloth re-targeting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Huang, Zhulin An, Yan Zeng, Chuanguang Yang, Xinqiang Yu, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (efCIL) aims to continuously incorporate the knowledge from new classes while retaining previously learned information, without storing any old-class exemplars (i.e., samples). For this purpose, various efCIL methods have been proposed over the past few years, generally with elaborately constructed old pseudo-features, increasing the difficulty of model development and interpretation. In contrast, we propose a \textbf{simple Incremental Representation (IR) framework} for efCIL without constructing old pseudo-features. IR utilizes dataset augmentation to cover a suitable feature space and prevents the model from forgetting by using a single L2 space maintenance loss. We discard the transient classifier trained on each one of the sequence tasks and instead replace it with a 1-near-neighbor classifier for inference, ensuring the representation is incrementally updated during CIL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed IR achieves comparable performance while significantly preventing the model from forgetting on CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNetSubset datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Wang, Wenbo Hu, Lei Zhu, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse rendering aims at recovering both geometry and materials of objects. It provides a more compatible reconstruction for conventional rendering engines, compared with the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). On the other hand, existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods cannot handle glossy objects with local light interactions well, as they typically oversimplify the illumination as a 2D environmental map, which assumes infinite lights only. Observing the superiority of NeRFs in recovering radiance fields, we propose a novel 5D Neural Plenoptic Function (NeP) based on NeRFs and ray tracing, such that more accurate lighting-object interactions can be formulated via the rendering equation. We also design a material-aware cone sampling strategy to efficiently integrate lights inside the BRDF lobes with the help of pre-filtered radiance fields. Our method has two stages: the geometry of the target object and the pre-filtered environmental radiance fields are reconstructed in the first stage, and materials of the target object are estimated in the second stage with the proposed NeP and material-aware cone sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on the proposed real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-fidelity geometry/materials of challenging glossy objects with complex lighting interactions from nearby objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Li, Lu Bai, Bin Yang, Chang Li, Lingfei Ma, Lixin Cui, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) plays an important role in intelligent transportation system (ITS). The early works predominantly focus on boosting the visual appeal of the fused result, and only several recent approaches have tried to combine the high-level vision task with IVF. However, they prioritize the design of cascaded structure to seek unified suitable features and fit different tasks. Thus, they tend to typically bias toward to reconstructing raw pixels without considering the significance of semantic features. Therefore, we propose a novel prior semantic guided image fusion method based on the dual-modality strategy, improving the performance of IVF in ITS. Specifically, to explore the independent significant semantic of each modality, we first design two parallel semantic segmentation branches with a refined feature adaptive-modulation (RFaM) mechanism. RFaM can perceive the features that are semantically distinct enough in each semantic segmentation branch. Then, two pilot experiments based on the two branches are conducted to capture the significant prior semantic of two images, which then is applied to guide the fusion task in the integration of semantic segmentation branches and fusion branches. In addition, to aggregate both high-level semantics and impressive visual effects, we further investigate the frequency response of the prior semantics, and propose a multi-level representation-adaptive fusion (MRaF) module to explicitly integrate the low-frequent prior semantic with the high-frequent details. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art image fusion approaches, in terms of either the visual appeal or the high-level semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Rendell, Jinming Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffeomorphic image registration is a commonly used method to deform one image to resemble another. While warping a single image to another is useful, it can be advantageous to warp multiple images simultaneously, such as in tracking the motion of the heart across a sequence of images. In this paper, our objective is to propose a novel method capable of registering a group or sequence of images to a target image, resulting in registered images that appear identical and therefore have a low rank. Moreover, we aim for these registered images to closely resemble the target image. Through experimental evidence, we will demonstrate our method's superior efficacy in producing low-rank groupwise deformations compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Zhu, Junwei Liang, Po-Yao Huang, Alex Hauptmann</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for egocentric videos. We propose a transformer-based model to learn class-discriminative and domain-invariant feature representations. It consists of two novel designs. The first module is called Generative Adversarial Domain Alignment Network with the aim of learning domain-invariant representations. It simultaneously learns a mask generator and a domain-invariant encoder in an adversarial way. The domain-invariant encoder is trained to minimize the distance between the source and target domain. The masking generator, conversely, aims at producing challenging masks by maximizing the domain distance. The second is a Masked Consistency Learning module to learn class-discriminative representations. It enforces the prediction consistency between the masked target videos and their full forms. To better evaluate the effectiveness of domain adaptation methods, we construct a more challenging benchmark for egocentric videos, U-Ego4D. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Epic-Kitchen and the proposed U-Ego4D benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Liang, Kuanrong Liu, Jiajun Gong, Jiawei Liang, Yuan Xun, Ee-Chien Chang, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for building high-quality features using the complementary strengths of various data modalities. However, the open nature of such systems inadvertently increases the possibility of backdoor attacks. These attacks subtly embed malicious behaviors within the model during training, which can be activated by specific triggers in the inference phase, posing significant security risks. Despite existing countermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the adverse impacts of such attacks, these defenses often degrade the clean accuracy and necessitate the construction of extensive clean training pairs. In this paper, we explore the possibility of a less-cost defense from the perspective of model unlearning, that is, whether the model can be made to quickly \textbf{u}nlearn \textbf{b}ackdoor \textbf{t}hreats (UBT) by constructing a small set of poisoned samples. Specifically, we strengthen the backdoor shortcuts to discover suspicious samples through overfitting training prioritized by weak similarity samples. Building on the initial identification of suspicious samples, we introduce an innovative token-based localized forgetting training regime. This technique specifically targets the poisoned aspects of the model, applying a focused effort to unlearn the backdoor associations and trying not to damage the integrity of the overall model. Experimental results show that our method not only ensures a minimal success rate for attacks, but also preserves the model's high clean accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16263">Emotion Recognition from the perspective of Activity Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Savinay Nagendra, Prapti Panigrahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Applications of an efficient emotion recognition system can be found in several domains such as medicine, driver fatigue surveillance, social robotics, and human-computer interaction. Appraising human emotional states, behaviors, and reactions displayed in real-world settings can be accomplished using latent continuous dimensions. Continuous dimensional models of human affect, such as those based on valence and arousal are more accurate in describing a broad range of spontaneous everyday emotions than more traditional models of discrete stereotypical emotion categories (e.g. happiness, surprise). Most of the prior work on estimating valence and arousal considers laboratory settings and acted data. But, for emotion recognition systems to be deployed and integrated into real-world mobile and computing devices, we need to consider data collected in the world. Action recognition is a domain of Computer Vision that involves capturing complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion between frames. In this paper, we treat emotion recognition from the perspective of action recognition by exploring the application of deep learning architectures specifically designed for action recognition, for continuous affect recognition. We propose a novel three-stream end-to-end deep learning regression pipeline with an attention mechanism, which is an ensemble design based on sub-modules of multiple state-of-the-art action recognition systems. The pipeline constitutes a novel data pre-processing approach with a spatial self-attention mechanism to extract keyframes. The optical flow of high-attention regions of the face is extracted to capture temporal context. AFEW-VA in-the-wild dataset has been used to conduct comparative experiments. Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms multiple standard baselines of both emotion recognition and action recognition models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcella Astrid, Muhammad Zaigham Zaheer, Seung-Ik Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to devise an anomaly detection model using only normal training data, an autoencoder (AE) is typically trained to reconstruct the data. As a result, the AE can extract normal representations in its latent space. During test time, since AE is not trained using real anomalies, it is expected to poorly reconstruct the anomalous data. However, several researchers have observed that it is not the case. In this work, we propose to limit the reconstruction capability of AE by introducing a novel latent constriction loss, which is added to the existing reconstruction loss. By using our method, no extra computational cost is added to the AE during test time. Evaluations using three video anomaly detection benchmark datasets, i.e., Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in limiting the reconstruction capability of AE, which leads to a better anomaly detection model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Liang, Wei Wang, Ruoyu Chen, Aishan Liu, Boxi Wu, Ee-Chien Chang, Xiaochun Cao, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of foundation models, deep learning-based object detectors have shown practical usability in closed set scenarios. However, for real-world tasks, object detectors often operate in open environments, where crucial factors (\eg, data distribution, objective) that influence model learning are often changing. The dynamic and intricate nature of the open environment poses novel and formidable challenges to object detectors. Unfortunately, current research on object detectors in open environments lacks a comprehensive analysis of their distinctive characteristics, challenges, and corresponding solutions, which hinders their secure deployment in critical real-world scenarios. This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive review and analysis of object detectors in open environments. We initially identified limitations of key structural components within the existing detection pipeline and propose the open environment object detector challenge framework that includes four quadrants (\ie, out-of-domain, out-of-category, robust learning, and incremental learning) based on the dimensions of the data / target changes. For each quadrant of challenges in the proposed framework, we present a detailed description and systematic analysis of the overarching goals and core difficulties, systematically review the corresponding solutions, and benchmark their performance over multiple widely adopted datasets. In addition, we engage in a discussion of open problems and potential avenues for future research. This paper aims to provide a fresh, comprehensive, and systematic understanding of the challenges and solutions associated with open-environment object detectors, thus catalyzing the development of more solid applications in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training strategies based on self-supervised learning (SSL) have proven to be effective pretext tasks for many downstream tasks in computer vision. Due to the significant disparity between medical and natural images, the application of typical SSL is not straightforward in medical imaging. Additionally, those pretext tasks often lack context, which is critical for computer-aided clinical decision support. In this paper, we developed a longitudinal masked auto-encoder (MAE) based on the well-known Transformer-based MAE. In particular, we explored the importance of time-aware position embedding as well as disease progression-aware masking. Taking into account the time between examinations instead of just scheduling them offers the benefit of capturing temporal changes and trends. The masking strategy, for its part, evolves during follow-up to better capture pathological changes, ensuring a more accurate assessment of disease progression. Using OPHDIAT, a large follow-up screening dataset targeting diabetic retinopathy (DR), we evaluated the pre-trained weights on a longitudinal task, which is to predict the severity label of the next visit within 3 years based on the past time series examinations. Our results demonstrated the relevancy of both time-aware position embedding and masking strategies based on disease progression knowledge. Compared to popular baseline models and standard longitudinal Transformers, these simple yet effective extensions significantly enhance the predictive ability of deep classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlong Tang, Daiki Shimada, Jing Bi, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In everyday communication, humans frequently use speech and gestures to refer to specific areas or objects, a process known as Referential Dialogue (RD). While prior studies have investigated RD through Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in static contexts, the exploration of Temporal Referential Dialogue (TRD) within audio-visual media remains limited. Two primary challenges hinder progress in this field: (1) the absence of comprehensive, untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations, and (2) the need for methods to integrate complex temporal auditory and visual cues effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework to generate PU-VALOR, an extensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 untrimmed videos with accurate temporal demarcations. We also present AVicuna, featuring an Audio-Visual Tokens Interleaver (AVTI) that ensures the temporal alignment of audio-visual information. Additionally, we develop the A5-222K dataset, encompassing more than 200,000 audio-text pairings, to facilitate the audio and text alignments. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna can effectively handle TRD in audio-visual videos and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various audio-visual video understanding tasks, particularly in untrimmed videos. We further investigate the optimal audio-interleaving rate for interleaved audio-visual inputs, which maximizes performance on the Audio-Visual Event Dense Localization task.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present latentSplat, a method to predict semantic Gaussians in a 3D latent space that can be splatted and decoded by a light-weight generative 2D architecture. Existing methods for generalizable 3D reconstruction either do not enable fast inference of high resolution novel views due to slow volume rendering, or are limited to interpolation of close input views, even in simpler settings with a single central object, where 360-degree generalization is possible. In this work, we combine a regression-based approach with a generative model, moving towards both of these capabilities within the same method, trained purely on readily available real video data. The core of our method are variational 3D Gaussians, a representation that efficiently encodes varying uncertainty within a latent space consisting of 3D feature Gaussians. From these Gaussians, specific instances can be sampled and rendered via efficient Gaussian splatting and a fast, generative decoder network. We show that latentSplat outperforms previous works in reconstruction quality and generalization, while being fast and scalable to high-resolution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cedric Perauer, Laurenz Adrian Heidrich, Haifan Zhang, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner, Anastasiia Kornilova, Alexey Artemov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, progress in acquisition equipment such as LiDAR sensors has enabled sensing increasingly spacious outdoor 3D environments. Making sense of such 3D acquisitions requires fine-grained scene understanding, such as constructing instance-based 3D scene segmentations. Commonly, a neural network is trained for this task; however, this requires access to a large, densely annotated dataset, which is widely known to be challenging to obtain. To address this issue, in this work we propose to predict instance segmentations for 3D scenes in an unsupervised way, without relying on ground-truth annotations. To this end, we construct a learning framework consisting of two components: (1) a pseudo-annotation scheme for generating initial unsupervised pseudo-labels; and (2) a self-training algorithm for instance segmentation to fit robust, accurate instances from initial noisy proposals. To enable generating 3D instance mask proposals, we construct a weighted proxy-graph by connecting 3D points with edges integrating multi-modal image- and point-based self-supervised features, and perform graph-cuts to isolate individual pseudo-instances. We then build on a state-of-the-art point-based architecture and train a 3D instance segmentation model, resulting in significant refinement of initial proposals. To scale to arbitrary complexity 3D scenes, we design our algorithm to operate on local 3D point chunks and construct a merging step to generate scene-level instance segmentations. Experiments on the challenging SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate the potential of our approach, where it attains 13.3% higher Average Precision and 9.1% higher F1 score compared to the best-performing baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhumitha Sakthi, Louis Kerofsky, Varun Ravi Kumar, Senthil Yogamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems require extensive data collection schemes to cover the diverse scenarios needed for building a robust and safe system. The data volumes are in the order of Exabytes and have to be stored for a long period of time (i.e., more than 10 years of the vehicle's life cycle). Lossless compression doesn't provide sufficient compression ratios, hence, lossy video compression has been explored. It is essential to prove that lossy video compression artifacts do not impact the performance of the perception algorithms. However, there is limited work in this area to provide a solid conclusion. In particular, there is no such work for fisheye cameras, which have high radial distortion and where compression may have higher artifacts. Fisheye cameras are commonly used in automotive systems for 3D object detection task. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of standard video compression codecs on wide FOV fisheye camera images. We demonstrate that the achievable compression with negligible impact depends on the dataset and temporal prediction of the video codec. We propose a radial distortion-aware zonal metric to evaluate the performance of artifacts in fisheye images. In addition, we present a novel method for estimating affine mode parameters of the latest VVC codec, and suggest some areas for improvement in video codecs for the application to fisheye imagery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in learning graph representations, especially graph Transformer, which has recently shown superior performance on various graph mining tasks. However, graph Transformer generally treats nodes as tokens, which results in quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes during self-attention computation. The graph MLP Mixer addresses this challenge by using the efficient MLP Mixer technique from computer vision. However, the time-consuming process of extracting graph tokens limits its performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named ChebMixer, a newly graph MLP Mixer that uses fast Chebyshev polynomials-based spectral filtering to extract a sequence of tokens. Firstly, we produce multiscale representations of graph nodes via fast Chebyshev polynomial-based spectral filtering. Next, we consider each node's multiscale representations as a sequence of tokens and refine the node representation with an effective MLP Mixer. Finally, we aggregate the multiscale representations of nodes through Chebyshev interpolation. Owing to the powerful representation capabilities and fast computational properties of MLP Mixer, we can quickly extract more informative node representations to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The experimental results prove our significant improvements in a variety of scenarios ranging from graph node classification to medical image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Wei Li, Hanting Chen, Junchao Liu, Jie Hu, Zhiwei Xiong, Chun Yuan, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In image restoration (IR), leveraging semantic priors from segmentation models has been a common approach to improve performance. The recent segment anything model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting advanced semantic priors to enhance IR tasks. However, the computational cost of SAM is prohibitive for IR, compared to existing smaller IR models. The incorporation of SAM for extracting semantic priors considerably hampers the model inference efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a general framework to distill SAM's semantic knowledge to boost exiting IR models without interfering with their inference process. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of the semantic priors fusion (SPF) scheme and the semantic priors distillation (SPD) scheme. SPF fuses two kinds of information between the restored image predicted by the original IR model and the semantic mask predicted by SAM for the refined restored image. SPD leverages a self-distillation manner to distill the fused semantic priors to boost the performance of original IR models. Additionally, we design a semantic-guided relation (SGR) module for SPD, which ensures semantic feature representation space consistency to fully distill the priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple IR models and tasks, including deraining, deblurring, and denoising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Zhang, Yexin Liu, Xu Zheng, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles a novel yet challenging problem: how to transfer knowledge from the emerging Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- which reveals impressive zero-shot instance segmentation capacity -- to learn a compact panoramic semantic segmentation model, i.e., student, without requiring any labeled data. This poses considerable challenges due to SAM's inability to provide semantic labels and the large capacity gap between SAM and the student. To this end, we propose a novel framework, called GoodSAM, that introduces a teacher assistant (TA) to provide semantic information, integrated with SAM to generate ensemble logits to achieve knowledge transfer. Specifically, we propose a Distortion-Aware Rectification (DAR) module that first addresses the distortion problem of panoramic images by imposing prediction-level consistency and boundary enhancement. This subtly enhances TA's prediction capacity on panoramic images. DAR then incorporates a cross-task complementary fusion block to adaptively merge the predictions of SAM and TA to obtain more reliable ensemble logits. Moreover, we introduce a Multi-level Knowledge Adaptation (MKA) module to efficiently transfer the multi-level feature knowledge from TA and ensemble logits to learn a compact student model. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that our GoodSAM achieves a remarkable +3.75\% mIoU improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods. Also, our most lightweight model achieves comparable performance to the SOTA methods with only 3.7M parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ai, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 360 depth estimation has recently received great attention for 3D reconstruction owing to its omnidirectional field of view (FoV). Recent approaches are predominantly focused on cross-projection fusion with geometry-based re-projection: they fuse 360 images with equirectangular projection (ERP) and another projection type, e.g., cubemap projection to estimate depth with the ERP format. However, these methods suffer from 1) limited local receptive fields, making it hardly possible to capture large FoV scenes, and 2) prohibitive computational cost, caused by the complex cross-projection fusion module design. In this paper, we propose Elite360D, a novel framework that inputs the ERP image and icosahedron projection (ICOSAP) point set, which is undistorted and spatially continuous. Elite360D is superior in its capacity in learning a representation from a local-with-global perspective. With a flexible ERP image encoder, it includes an ICOSAP point encoder, and a Bi-projection Bi-attention Fusion (B2F) module (totally ~1M parameters). Specifically, the ERP image encoder can take various perspective image-trained backbones (e.g., ResNet, Transformer) to extract local features. The point encoder extracts the global features from the ICOSAP. Then, the B2F module captures the semantic- and distance-aware dependencies between each pixel of the ERP feature and the entire ICOSAP feature set. Without specific backbone design and obvious computational cost increase, Elite360D outperforms the prior arts on several benchmark datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16379">FlashEval: Towards Fast and Accurate Evaluation of Text-to-image Diffusion Generative Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Zhao, Tianchen Zhao, Zinan Lin, Xuefei Ning, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of text-to-image generative models. Evaluating the quality of the generative models is one essential step in the development process. Unfortunately, the evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational resources, making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g., monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore, we seek to improve the evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices, including the selection criteria (textural features or image-based metrics) and the selection granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem, and we propose FlashEval, an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashEval on ranking diffusion models with various configurations, including architectures, quantization levels, and sampler schedules on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets. Our searched 50-item subset could achieve comparable evaluation quality to the randomly sampled 500-item subset for COCO annotations on unseen models, achieving a 10x evaluation speedup. We release the condensed subset of these commonly used datasets to help facilitate diffusion algorithm design and evaluation, and open-source FlashEval as a tool for condensing future datasets, accessible at https://github.com/thu-nics/FlashEval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zhuowan, Jasani Bhavan, Tang Peng, Ghadar Shabnam</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding data visualizations like charts and plots requires reasoning about both visual elements and numerics. Although strong in extractive questions, current chart visual question answering (chart VQA) models suffer on complex reasoning questions. In this work, we address the lack of reasoning ability by data augmentation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown to have strong reasoning ability, as an automatic data annotator that generates question-answer annotations for chart images. The key innovation in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step sub-questions (rationales), which are then used to derive the final answer using external tools, i.e. Python. This step-wise generation procedure is trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation pipeline. Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed step-by-step generation. By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA), we significantly enhance the chart VQA models, achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. In particular, our approach improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54% on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset, which needs strong reasoning. We hope our work underscores the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of data augmentation using LLMs for reasoning-heavy tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Chen, Luyang Luo, Yequan Bie, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still been faced with several challenges. First, the inherent imbalance in the distribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses. Second, the frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm the critical abnormal information. Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs. Recently, LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate prompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts. Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with perceiver to extract the visual information. To tailor the LLM for report generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated during training to capture common disease representations. Furthermore, we introduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for different diseases. Experiments on the chest CT dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed previous methods and achieved state-of-the-art on both clinical efficacy performance and natural language generation metrics. The code will be made publically available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunpeng Yi, Han Xu, Hao Zhang, Linfeng Tang, Jiayi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Image fusion aims to combine information from different source images to create a comprehensively representative image. Existing fusion methods are typically helpless in dealing with degradations in low-quality source images and non-interactive to multiple subjective and objective needs. To solve them, we introduce a novel approach that leverages semantic text guidance image fusion model for degradation-aware and interactive image fusion task, termed as Text-IF. It innovatively extends the classical image fusion to the text guided image fusion along with the ability to harmoniously address the degradation and interaction issues during fusion. Through the text semantic encoder and semantic interaction fusion decoder, Text-IF is accessible to the all-in-one infrared and visible image degradation-aware processing and the interactive flexible fusion outcomes. In this way, Text-IF achieves not only multi-modal image fusion, but also multi-modal information fusion. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed text guided image fusion strategy has obvious advantages over SOTA methods in the image fusion performance and degradation treatment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglong Sun, Haijiang Sun, Shan Jiang, Jiacheng Wang, Xilai Wei, Zhonghe Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification-regression prediction networks have realized impressive success in several modern deep trackers. However, there is an inherent difference between classification and regression tasks, so they have diverse even opposite demands for feature matching. Existed models always ignore the key issue and only employ a unified matching block in two task branches, decaying the decision quality. Besides, these models also struggle with decision misalignment situation. In this paper, we propose a multi-attention associate prediction network (MAPNet) to tackle the above problems. Concretely, two novel matchers, i.e., category-aware matcher and spatial-aware matcher, are first designed for feature comparison by integrating self, cross, channel or spatial attentions organically. They are capable of fully capturing the category-related semantics for classification and the local spatial contexts for regression, respectively. Then, we present a dual alignment module to enhance the correspondences between two branches, which is useful to find the optimal tracking solution. Finally, we describe a Siamese tracker built upon the proposed prediction network, which achieves the leading performance on five tracking benchmarks, consisting of LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2k and UAV123, and surpasses other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Schieber, Shiyu Li, Niklas Corell, Philipp Beckerle, Julian Kreimeier, Daniel Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical and industrial domains, providing guidance for assembly processes is critical to ensure efficiency and safety. Errors in assembly can lead to significant consequences such as extended surgery times, and prolonged manufacturing or maintenance times in industry. Assembly scenarios can benefit from in-situ AR visualization to provide guidance, reduce assembly times and minimize errors. To enable in-situ visualization 6D pose estimation can be leveraged. Existing 6D pose estimation techniques primarily focus on individual objects and static captures. However, assembly scenarios have various dynamics including occlusion during assembly and dynamics in the assembly objects appearance. Existing work, combining object detection/6D pose estimation and assembly state detection focuses either on pure deep learning-based approaches, or limit the assembly state detection to building blocks. To address the challenges of 6D pose estimation in combination with assembly state detection, our approach ASDF builds upon the strengths of YOLOv8, a real-time capable object detection framework. We extend this framework, refine the object pose and fuse pose knowledge with network-detected pose information. Utilizing our late fusion in our Pose2State module results in refined 6D pose estimation and assembly state detection. By combining both pose and state information, our Pose2State module predicts the final assembly state with precision. Our evaluation on our ASDF dataset shows that our Pose2State module leads to an improved assembly state detection and that the improvement of the assembly state further leads to a more robust 6D pose estimation. Moreover, on the GBOT dataset, we outperform the pure deep learning-based network, and even outperform the hybrid and pure tracking-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Guo, Yuanxi Bai, Liwen Hu, Mianzhi Liu, Ziyi Guo, Lei Ma, Tiejun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As a neuromorphic sensor with high temporal resolution, spike cameras offer notable advantages over traditional cameras in high-speed vision applications such as high-speed optical estimation, depth estimation, and object tracking. Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes. Instead of the multi-view images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time. To reconstruct a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes generated by blender with the spike camera simulator. Our results demonstrate that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes. Our code and data will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Deng, Jiahao Lu, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to establish point-wise correspondences between source and target point clouds. Existing methods obtain correspondences directly by computing point-wise feature similarity between point clouds. However, non-rigid objects possess strong deformability and unusual shapes, making it a longstanding challenge to directly establish correspondences between point clouds with unconventional shapes. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised Template-Assisted point cloud shape correspondence Network, termed TANet, including a template generation module and a template assistance module. The proposed TANet enjoys several merits. Firstly, the template generation module establishes a set of learnable templates with explicit structures. Secondly, we introduce a template assistance module that extensively leverages the generated templates to establish more accurate shape correspondences from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments on four human and animal datasets demonstrate that TANet achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanyam Lakhanpal, Shivang Chopra, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Man Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation approaches based on diffusion models have gained significant attention. However, vanilla diffusion models often suffer from spelling inaccuracies in the text displayed within the generated images. The capability to generate visual text is crucial, offering both academic interest and a wide range of practical applications. To produce accurate visual text images, state-of-the-art techniques adopt a glyph-controlled image generation approach, consisting of a text layout generator followed by an image generator that is conditioned on the generated text layout. Nevertheless, our study reveals that these models still face three primary challenges, prompting us to develop a testbed to facilitate future research. We introduce a benchmark, LenCom-Eval, specifically designed for testing models' capability in generating images with Lengthy and Complex visual text. Subsequently, we introduce a training-free framework to enhance the two-stage generation approaches. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on both LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval benchmarks and demonstrate notable improvements across a range of evaluation metrics, including CLIPScore, OCR precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and edit distance scores. For instance, our proposed framework improves the backbone model, TextDiffuser, by more than 23\% and 13.5\% in terms of OCR word F1 on LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval, respectively. Our work makes a unique contribution to the field by focusing on generating images with long and rare text sequences, a niche previously unexplored by existing literature</p>

<p>Abstract: We interact with the world with our hands and see it through our own (egocentric) perspective. A holistic 3D understanding of such interactions from egocentric views is important for tasks in robotics, AR/VR, action recognition and motion generation. Accurately reconstructing such interactions in 3D is challenging due to heavy occlusion, viewpoint bias, camera distortion, and motion blur from the head movement. To this end, we designed the HANDS23 challenge based on the AssemblyHands and ARCTIC datasets with carefully designed training and testing splits. Based on the results of the top submitted methods and more recent baselines on the leaderboards, we perform a thorough analysis on 3D hand(-object) reconstruction tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of addressing distortion specific to egocentric cameras, adopting high-capacity transformers to learn complex hand-object interactions, and fusing predictions from different views. Our study further reveals challenging scenarios intractable with state-of-the-art methods, such as fast hand motion, object reconstruction from narrow egocentric views, and close contact between two hands and objects. Our efforts will enrich the community's knowledge foundation and facilitate future hand studies on egocentric hand-object interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxuan Yu, Hao Wang, Weiming Li, Qiang Wang, Soonyong Cho, Younghun Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: Point scene understanding is a challenging task to process real-world scene point cloud, which aims at segmenting each object, estimating its pose, and reconstructing its mesh simultaneously. Recent state-of-the-art method first segments each object and then processes them independently with multiple stages for the different sub-tasks. This leads to a complex pipeline to optimize and makes it hard to leverage the relationship constraints between multiple objects. In this work, we propose a novel Disentangled Object-Centric TRansformer (DOCTR) that explores object-centric representation to facilitate learning with multiple objects for the multiple sub-tasks in a unified manner. Each object is represented as a query, and a Transformer decoder is adapted to iteratively optimize all the queries involving their relationship. In particular, we introduce a semantic-geometry disentangled query (SGDQ) design that enables the query features to attend separately to semantic information and geometric information relevant to the corresponding sub-tasks. A hybrid bipartite matching module is employed to well use the supervisions from all the sub-tasks during training. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging ScanNet dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Lin, Zhe Liu, Zhongyu Xia, Xinhao Wang, Yongtao Wang, Shengxiang Qi, Yang Dong, Nan Dong, Le Zhang, Ce Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional object detection is one of the key tasks in autonomous driving. To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object detection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying solely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object detection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras with the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable multi-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction. RadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section (RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based encoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features, with an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the two encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to scattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature from radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse the feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show that RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on nuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore, RCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only and radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21~28 FPS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengna Li, Kangyi Wu, Wenli Huang, Sanping Zhou, Jinjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised person re-identification aims to retrieve images of a specified person without identity labels. Many recent unsupervised Re-ID approaches adopt clustering-based methods to measure cross-camera feature similarity to roughly divide images into clusters. They ignore the feature distribution discrepancy induced by camera domain gap, resulting in the unavoidable performance degradation. Camera information is usually available, and the feature distribution in the single camera usually focuses more on the appearance of the individual and has less intra-identity variance. Inspired by the observation, we introduce a \textbf{C}amera-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{L}abel \textbf{R}efinement~(CALR) framework that reduces camera discrepancy by clustering intra-camera similarity. Specifically, we employ intra-camera training to obtain reliable local pseudo labels within each camera, and then refine global labels generated by inter-camera clustering and train the discriminative model using more reliable global pseudo labels in a self-paced manner. Meanwhile, we develop a camera-alignment module to align feature distributions under different cameras, which could help deal with the camera variance further. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches. The code is accessible at https://github.com/leeBooMla/CALR.</p>

Our key idea lies in leveraging meshes for rendering acceleration while incorporating a novel approach to parameterize view-dependent information. We decompose the color into diffuse and specular, and model the specular color in the reflected direction based on a neural environment map. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable reconstruction quality for highly reflective surfaces compared to state-of-the-art offline methods, while also efficiently enabling real-time rendering on edge devices such as smartphones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Xu, Junjie Luo, Qi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CT-Bound, a fast boundary estimation method for noisy images using a hybrid Convolution and Transformer neural network. The proposed architecture decomposes boundary estimation into two tasks: local detection and global regularization of image boundaries. It first estimates a parametric representation of boundary structures only using the input image within a small receptive field and then refines the boundary structure in the parameter domain without accessing the input image. Because of this, a part of the network can be easily trained using naive, synthetic images and still generalized to real images, and the entire architecture is computationally efficient as the boundary refinement is non-iterative and not in the image domain. Compared with the previous highest accuracy methods, our experiment shows that CT-Bound is 100 times faster, producing comparably accurate, high-quality boundary and color maps. We also demonstrate that CT-Bound can produce boundary and color maps on real captured images without extra fine-tuning and real-time boundary map and color map videos at ten frames per second.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxuan Lu, Fang Yan, Xiaofan Zhang, Yue Gao, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As natural image understanding moves towards the pretrain-finetune era, research in pathology imaging is concurrently evolving. Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Zhang, Dong Wei, Mengmeng Zhua, Shi Gu, Yefeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pretraining deep networks on unlabeled data, prior to transfer learning of target tasks with limited annotation. The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target tasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks have been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three dimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic ones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data with anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of the imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can pretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work, we propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data based on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn the relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as regressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging planes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack. Both pretext tasks are conceptually straightforward and easy to implement, and can be combined in multitask learning for better representation learning. Thorough experiments on two anatomical structures (heart and knee) and representative target tasks (semantic segmentation and classification) demonstrate that the proposed pretext tasks are effective in pretraining deep networks for remarkably boosted performance on the target tasks, and superior to other recent approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiushi Nie, Xiaoqing Zhang, Yan Hu, Mingdao Gong, Jiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image registration is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment with its ability to merge diverse information of images, which may be captured under different times, angles, or modalities. Although several surveys have reviewed the development of medical image registration, these surveys have not systematically summarized methodologies of existing medical image registration methods. To this end, we provide a comprehensive review of these methods from traditional and deep learning-based directions, aiming to help audiences understand the development of medical image registration quickly. In particular, we review recent advances in retinal image registration at the end of each section, which has not attracted much attention. Additionally, we also discuss the current challenges of retinal image registration and provide insights and prospects for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Huang, Fan Tang, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Juan Cao, Jintao Li, Tong-Yee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable process of talking-head-based avatar-creating solutions, directly generating anchor-style videos with full-body motions remains challenging. In this study, we propose Make-Your-Anchor, a novel system necessitating only a one-minute video clip of an individual for training, subsequently enabling the automatic generation of anchor-style videos with precise torso and hand movements. Specifically, we finetune a proposed structure-guided diffusion model on input video to render 3D mesh conditions into human appearances. We adopt a two-stage training strategy for the diffusion model, effectively binding movements with specific appearances. To produce arbitrary long temporal video, we extend the 2D U-Net in the frame-wise diffusion model to a 3D style without additional training cost, and a simple yet effective batch-overlapped temporal denoising module is proposed to bypass the constraints on video length during inference. Finally, a novel identity-specific face enhancement module is introduced to improve the visual quality of facial regions in the output videos. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the system in terms of visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation, outperforming SOTA diffusion/non-diffusion methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyou Liang, Run Wang, Weifeng Liu, Yuyang Zhang, Wenyuan Yang, Lina Wang, Xingkai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last few years, generative models have shown their powerful capabilities in synthesizing realistic images in both quality and diversity (i.e., facial images, and natural subjects). Unfortunately, the artifact patterns in fake images synthesized by different generative models are inconsistent, leading to the failure of previous research that relied on spotting subtle differences between real and fake. In our preliminary experiments, we find that the artifacts in fake images always change with the development of the generative model, while natural images exhibit stable statistical properties. In this paper, we employ natural traces shared only by real images as an additional predictive target in the detector. Specifically, the natural traces are learned from the wild real images and we introduce extended supervised contrastive learning to bring them closer to real images and further away from fake ones. This motivates the detector to make decisions based on the proximity of images to the natural traces. To conduct a comprehensive experiment, we built a high-quality and diverse dataset that includes generative models comprising 6 GAN and 6 diffusion models, to evaluate the effectiveness in generalizing unknown forgery techniques and robustness in surviving different transformations. Experimental results show that our proposed method gives 96.1% mAP significantly outperforms the baselines. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely recognized platform Midjourney reveal that our proposed method achieves an accuracy exceeding 78.4%, underscoring its practicality for real-world application deployment. The source code and partial self-built dataset are available in supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangqian Yang, Kangrui Du, Zhihan Yang, Ye Du, Yongping Zheng, Shujun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative condition leading to cognitive and functional deterioration. Given the lack of a cure, prompt and precise AD diagnosis is vital, a complex process dependent on multiple factors and multi-modal data. While successful efforts have been made to integrate multi-modal representation learning into medical datasets, scant attention has been given to 3D medical images. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Masked Vim Autoencoder (CMViM), the first efficient representation learning method tailored for 3D multi-modal data. Our proposed framework is built on a masked Vim autoencoder to learn a unified multi-modal representation and long-dependencies contained in 3D medical images. We also introduce an intra-modal contrastive learning module to enhance the capability of the multi-modal Vim encoder for modeling the discriminative features in the same modality, and an inter-modal contrastive learning module to alleviate misaligned representation among modalities. Our framework consists of two main steps: 1) incorporate the Vision Mamba (Vim) into the mask autoencoder to reconstruct 3D masked multi-modal data efficiently. 2) align the multi-modal representations with contrastive learning mechanisms from both intra-modal and inter-modal aspects. Our framework is pre-trained and validated ADNI2 dataset and validated on the downstream task for AD classification. The proposed CMViM yields 2.7\% AUC performance improvement compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration plays a crucial role in medical imaging, aiding in disease diagnosis and image-guided interventions. Traditional iterative methods are slow, while deep learning (DL) accelerates solutions but faces usability and precision challenges. This study introduces a pyramid network with the enhanced motion decomposition Transformer (ModeTv2) operator, showcasing superior pairwise optimization (PO) akin to traditional methods. We re-implement ModeT operator with CUDA extensions to enhance its computational efficiency. We further propose RegHead module which refines deformation fields, improves the realism of deformation and reduces parameters. By adopting the PO, the proposed network balances accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. Extensive experiments on two public brain MRI datasets and one abdominal CT dataset demonstrate the network's suitability for PO, providing a DL model with enhanced usability and interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimity Miller, Niko S\"underhauf, Alex Kenna, Keita Mason</p>
<p>Abstract: Are vision-language models (VLMs) open-set models because they are trained on internet-scale datasets? We answer this question with a clear no - VLMs introduce closed-set assumptions via their finite query set, making them vulnerable to open-set conditions. We systematically evaluate VLMs for open-set recognition and find they frequently misclassify objects not contained in their query set, leading to alarmingly low precision when tuned for high recall and vice versa. We show that naively increasing the size of the query set to contain more and more classes does not mitigate this problem, but instead causes diminishing task performance and open-set performance. We establish a revised definition of the open-set problem for the age of VLMs, define a new benchmark and evaluation protocol to facilitate standardised evaluation and research in this important area, and evaluate promising baseline approaches based on predictive uncertainty and dedicated negative embeddings on a range of VLM classifiers and object detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhao Hu, Shaochong Jia, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used for conditional data cross-modal generation tasks such as text-to-image and text-to-video. However, state-of-the-art models still fail to align the generated visual concepts with high-level semantics in a language such as object count, spatial relationship, etc. We approach this problem from a multimodal data fusion perspective and investigate how different fusion strategies can affect vision-language alignment. We discover that compared to the widely used early fusion of conditioning text in a pretrained image feature space, a specially designed intermediate fusion can: (i) boost text-to-image alignment with improved generation quality and (ii) improve training and inference efficiency by reducing low-rank text-to-image attention calculations. We perform experiments using a text-to-image generation task on the MS-COCO dataset. We compare our intermediate fusion mechanism with the classic early fusion mechanism on two common conditioning methods on a U-shaped ViT backbone. Our intermediate fusion model achieves a higher CLIP Score and lower FID, with 20% reduced FLOPs, and 50% increased training speed compared to a strong U-ViT baseline with an early fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Tang, Peijie Dong, Zhenheng Tang, Xiaowen Chu, Junwei Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining CNNs or ViTs, with RNNs for spatiotemporal forecasting, has yielded unparalleled results in predicting temporal and spatial dynamics. However, modeling extensive global information remains a formidable challenge; CNNs are limited by their narrow receptive fields, and ViTs struggle with the intensive computational demands of their attention mechanisms. The emergence of recent Mamba-based architectures has been met with enthusiasm for their exceptional long-sequence modeling capabilities, surpassing established vision models in efficiency and accuracy, which motivates us to develop an innovative architecture tailored for spatiotemporal forecasting. In this paper, we propose the VMRNN cell, a new recurrent unit that integrates the strengths of Vision Mamba blocks with LSTM. We construct a network centered on VMRNN cells to tackle spatiotemporal prediction tasks effectively. Our extensive evaluations show that our proposed approach secures competitive results on a variety of tasks while maintaining a smaller model size.

<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify the target object within a 3D point cloud scene referred to by a natural language description. While previous works attempt to exploit the verbo-visual relation with proposed cross-modal transformers, unstructured natural utterances and scattered objects might lead to undesirable performances. In this paper, we introduce DOrA, a novel 3D visual grounding framework with Order-Aware referring. DOrA is designed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse language description, suggesting a referential order of anchor objects. Such ordered anchor objects allow DOrA to update visual features and locate the target object during the grounding process. Experimental results on the NR3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate our superiority in both low-resource and full-data scenarios. In particular, DOrA surpasses current state-of-the-art frameworks by 9.3% and 7.8% grounding accuracy under 1% data and 10% data settings, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Yanjie Wang, Yongjie Ye, Yuxiang Nie, Can Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their ability to perceive objects in still images, but their application in video-related tasks, such as object tracking, remains understudied. This lack of exploration is primarily due to two key challenges. Firstly, extensive pretraining on large-scale video datasets is required to equip MLLMs with the capability to perceive objects across multiple frames and understand inter-frame relationships. Secondly, processing a large number of frames within the context window of Large Language Models (LLMs) can impose a significant computational burden. To address the first challenge, we introduce ElysiumTrack-1M, a large-scale video dataset paired with novel tasks: Referring Single Object Tracking (RSOT) and Video Referring Expression Generation (Video-REG). ElysiumTrack-1M contains 1.27 million annotated video frames with corresponding object boxes and descriptions. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct training of MLLMs and propose a token-compression model T-Selector to tackle the second challenge. Our proposed approach, Elysium: Exploring Object-level Perception in Videos via MLLM, is an end-to-end trainable MLLM that makes the first attempt to conduct object-level tasks in videos without requiring any additional plug-in or expert models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingdong Shen, Fangxin Shang, Yehui Yang, Xiaoshuang Huang, Shining Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation models adapting to new tasks in a training-free manner through in-context learning is an exciting advancement. Universal segmentation models aim to generalize across the diverse modality of medical images, yet their effectiveness often diminishes when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) data modalities and tasks, requiring intricate fine-tuning of model for optimal performance. For addressing this challenge, we introduce SegICL, a novel approach leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) for image segmentation. Unlike existing methods, SegICL has the capability to employ text-guided segmentation and conduct in-context learning with a small set of image-mask pairs, eliminating the need for training the model from scratch or fine-tuning for OOD tasks (including OOD modality and dataset). Extensive experimental validation of SegICL demonstrates a positive correlation between the number of prompt samples and segmentation performance on OOD modalities and tasks. This indicates that SegICL effectively address new segmentation tasks based on contextual information. Additionally, SegICL also exhibits comparable segmentation performance to mainstream models on OOD and in-distribution tasks. Our code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aysim Toker, Marvin Eisenberger, Daniel Cremers, Laura Leal-Taix\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, semantic segmentation has become a pivotal tool in processing and interpreting satellite imagery. Yet, a prevalent limitation of supervised learning techniques remains the need for extensive manual annotations by experts. In this work, we explore the potential of generative image diffusion to address the scarcity of annotated data in earth observation tasks. The main idea is to learn the joint data manifold of images and labels, leveraging recent advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate both images and corresponding masks for satellite segmentation. We find that the obtained pairs not only display high quality in fine-scale features but also ensure a wide sampling diversity. Both aspects are crucial for earth observation data, where semantic classes can vary severely in scale and occurrence frequency. We employ the novel data instances for downstream segmentation, as a form of data augmentation. In our experiments, we provide comparisons to prior works based on discriminative diffusion models or GANs. We demonstrate that integrating generated samples yields significant quantitative improvements for satellite semantic segmentation -- both compared to baselines and when training only on the original data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have positioned them at the forefront of image generation. Despite their superior performance, diffusion models are not without drawbacks; they are characterized by complex architectures and substantial computational demands, resulting in significant latency due to their iterative sampling process. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a dual approach involving model miniaturization and a reduction in sampling steps, aimed at significantly decreasing model latency. Our methodology leverages knowledge distillation to streamline the U-Net and image decoder architectures, and introduces an innovative one-step DM training technique that utilizes feature matching and score distillation. We present two models, SDXS-512 and SDXS-1024, achieving inference speeds of approximately 100 FPS (30x faster than SD v1.5) and 30 FP (60x faster than SDXL) on a single GPU, respectively. Moreover, our training approach offers promising applications in image-conditioned control, facilitating efficient image-to-image translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si Liu, Zihan Ding, Jiahui Fu, Hongyu Li, Siheng Chen, Shifeng Zhang, Xu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of the collaborative vehicle-to-everything perception task is to enhance the individual vehicle's perception capability through message communication among neighboring traffic agents. Previous methods focus on achieving optimal performance within bandwidth limitations and typically adopt BEV maps as the basic collaborative message units. However, we demonstrate that collaboration with dense representations is plagued by object feature destruction during message packing, inefficient message aggregation for long-range collaboration, and implicit structure representation communication. To tackle these issues, we introduce a brand new message unit, namely point cluster, designed to represent the scene sparsely with a combination of low-level structure information and high-level semantic information. The point cluster inherently preserves object information while packing messages, with weak relevance to the collaboration range, and supports explicit structure modeling. Building upon this representation, we propose a novel framework V2X-PC for collaborative perception. This framework includes a Point Cluster Packing (PCP) module to keep object feature and manage bandwidth through the manipulation of cluster point numbers. As for effective message aggregation, we propose a Point Cluster Aggregation (PCA) module to match and merge point clusters associated with the same object. To further handle time latency and pose errors encountered in real-world scenarios, we propose parameter-free solutions that can adapt to different noisy levels without finetuning. Experiments on two widely recognized collaborative perception benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method compared to the previous state-of-the-art approaches relying on BEV maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlong Tang, Yuxuan Wan, Lei Qi, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free Domain Generalization (SFDG) aims to develop a model that works for unseen target domains without relying on any source domain. Recent work, PromptStyler, employs text prompts to simulate different distribution shifts in the joint vision-language space, allowing the model to generalize effectively to unseen domains without using any images. However, 1) PromptStyler's style generation strategy has limitations, as all style patterns are fixed after the first training phase. This leads to the training set in the second training phase being restricted to a limited set of styles. Additionally, 2) the frozen text encoder in PromptStyler result in the encoder's output varying with the style of the input text prompts, making it difficult for the model to learn domain-invariant features. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic PromptStyler (DPStyler), comprising Style Generation and Style Removal modules to address these issues. The Style Generation module refreshes all styles at every training epoch, while the Style Removal module eliminates variations in the encoder's output features caused by input styles. Moreover, since the Style Generation module, responsible for generating style word vectors using random sampling or style mixing, makes the model sensitive to input text prompts, we introduce a model ensemble method to mitigate this sensitivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgery digitalization is the process of creating a virtual replica of real-world surgery, also referred to as a surgical digital twin (SDT). It has significant applications in various fields such as education and training, surgical planning, and automation of surgical tasks. Given their detailed representations of surgical procedures, SDTs are an ideal foundation for machine learning methods, enabling automatic generation of training data. In robotic surgery, SDTs can provide realistic virtual environments in which robots may learn through trial and error. In this paper, we present a proof of concept (PoC) for surgery digitalization that is applied to an ex-vivo spinal surgery performed in realistic conditions. The proposed digitalization focuses on the acquisition and modelling of the geometry and appearance of the entire surgical scene. We employ five RGB-D cameras for dynamic 3D reconstruction of the surgeon, a high-end camera for 3D reconstruction of the anatomy, an infrared stereo camera for surgical instrument tracking, and a laser scanner for 3D reconstruction of the operating room and data fusion. We justify the proposed methodology, discuss the challenges faced and further extensions of our prototype. While our PoC partially relies on manual data curation, its high quality and great potential motivate the development of automated methods for the creation of SDTs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linglin Jing, Yiming Ding, Yunpeng Gao, Zhigang Wang, Xu Yan, Dong Wang, Gerald Schaefer, Hui Fang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation has gained popularity due to its capability to deal with scenarios under high-speed motion and extreme lighting conditions, which cannot be addressed by conventional RGB cameras. Since it is hard to annotate event data, previous approaches rely on event-to-image reconstruction to obtain pseudo labels for training. However, this will inevitably introduce noise, and learning from noisy pseudo labels, especially when generated from a single source, may reinforce the errors. This drawback is also called confirmation bias in pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid pseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised event-based semantic segmentation, HPL-ESS, to alleviate the influence of noisy pseudo labels. In particular, we first employ a plain unsupervised domain adaptation framework as our baseline, which can generate a set of pseudo labels through self-training. Then, we incorporate offline event-to-image reconstruction into the framework, and obtain another set of pseudo labels by predicting segmentation maps on the reconstructed images. A noisy label learning strategy is designed to mix the two sets of pseudo labels and enhance the quality. Moreover, we propose a soft prototypical alignment module to further improve the consistency of target domain features. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the DSEC-Semantic dataset (+5.88% accuracy, +10.32% mIoU), which even surpasses several supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoyang Zhao, Fulong Ma, Yuxuan Liu, Weiqing Qi, Ming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Curb detection is an important function in intelligent driving and can be used to determine drivable areas of the road. However, curbs are difficult to detect due to the complex road environment. This paper introduces CurbNet, a novel framework for curb detection, leveraging point cloud segmentation. Addressing the dearth of comprehensive curb datasets and the absence of 3D annotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset, encompassing 7,100 frames, which represents the largest and most categorically diverse collection of curb point clouds currently available. Recognizing that curbs are primarily characterized by height variations, our approach harnesses spatially-rich 3D point clouds for training. To tackle the challenges presented by the uneven distribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their reliance on z-axis high-frequency features, we introduce the multi-scale and channel attention (MSCA) module, a bespoke solution designed to optimize detection performance. Moreover, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group, specifically formulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds relative to other categories. Our extensive experimentation on 2 major datasets has yielded results that surpass existing benchmarks set by leading curb detection and point cloud segmentation models. By integrating multi-clustering and curve fitting techniques in our post-processing stage, we have substantially reduced noise in curb detection, thereby enhancing precision to 0.8744. Notably, CurbNet has achieved an exceptional average metrics of over 0.95 at a tolerance of just 0.15m, thereby establishing a new benchmark. Furthermore, corroborative real-world experiments and dataset analyzes mutually validate each other, solidifying CurbNet's superior detection proficiency and its robust generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixuan Hao, Wei Chen, Yibo Yan, Siru Zhong, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban indicator prediction aims to infer socio-economic metrics in diverse urban landscapes using data-driven methods. However, prevalent pre-trained models, particularly those reliant on satellite imagery, face dual challenges. Firstly, concentrating solely on macro-level patterns from satellite data may introduce bias, lacking nuanced details at micro levels, such as architectural details at a place. Secondly, the lack of interpretability in pre-trained models limits their utility in providing transparent evidence for urban planning. In response to these issues, we devise a novel Vision-Language Pre-Trained Model (UrbanVLP) in this paper. Our UrbanVLP seamlessly integrates multi-granularity information from both macro (satellite) and micro (street-view) levels, overcoming the limitations of prior pre-trained models. Moreover, it introduces automatic text generation and calibration, elevating interpretability in downstream applications by producing high-quality text descriptions of urban imagery. Rigorous experiments conducted across six socio-economic tasks underscore UrbanVLP's superior performance. We also deploy a web platform to verify its practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Luo, Xiqing Guo, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the complementary nature of visible light and thermal in-frared modalities, object tracking based on the fusion of visible light images and thermal images (referred to as RGB-T tracking) has received increasing attention from researchers in recent years. How to achieve more comprehensive fusion of information from the two modalities at a lower cost has been an issue that re-searchers have been exploring. Inspired by visual prompt learn-ing, we designed a novel two-stream RGB-T tracking architecture based on cross-modal mutual prompt learning, and used this model as a teacher to guide a one-stream student model for rapid learning through knowledge distillation techniques. Extensive experiments have shown that, compared to similar RGB-T track-ers, our designed teacher model achieved the highest precision rate, while the student model, with comparable precision rate to the teacher model, realized an inference speed more than three times faster than the teacher model.(Codes will be available if accepted.)</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16848">Multiple Object Tracking as ID Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruopeng Gao, Yijun Zhang, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), tracking-by-detection methods have stood the test for a long time, which split the process into two parts according to the definition: object detection and association. They leverage robust single-frame detectors and treat object association as a post-processing step through hand-crafted heuristic algorithms and surrogate tasks. However, the nature of heuristic techniques prevents end-to-end exploitation of training data, leading to increasingly cumbersome and challenging manual modification while facing complicated or novel scenarios. In this paper, we regard this object association task as an End-to-End in-context ID prediction problem and propose a streamlined baseline called MOTIP. Specifically, we form the target embeddings into historical trajectory information while considering the corresponding IDs as in-context prompts, then directly predict the ID labels for the objects in the current frame. Thanks to this end-to-end process, MOTIP can learn tracking capabilities straight from training data, freeing itself from burdensome hand-crafted algorithms. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves impressive state-of-the-art performance in complex scenarios like DanceTrack and SportsMOT, and it performs competitively with other transformer-based methods on MOT17. We believe that MOTIP demonstrates remarkable potential and can serve as a starting point for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MOTIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Hahlbohm, Linus Franke, Moritz Kappel, Susana Castillo, Marc Stamminger, Marcus Magnor</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel-view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes a point cloud in a continuous octree-based probability field and a multi-resolution hash grid. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds by retaining favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving fine geometric detail without depending on initial priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on several common benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can extract explicit point clouds to further enhance performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingji Zhong, Lanqing Hong, Zhenguo Li, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive capabilities for photorealistic novel view synthesis when trained on dense inputs. However, when trained on sparse inputs, NeRF typically encounters issues of incorrect density or color predictions, mainly due to insufficient coverage of the scene causing partial and sparse supervision, thus leading to significant performance degradation. While existing works mainly consider ray-level consistency to construct 2D learning regularization based on rendered color, depth, or semantics on image planes, in this paper we propose a novel approach that models 3D spatial field consistency to improve NeRF's performance with sparse inputs. Specifically, we first adopt a voxel-based ray sampling strategy to ensure that the sampled rays intersect with a certain voxel in 3D space. We then randomly sample additional points within the voxel and apply a Transformer to infer the properties of other points on each ray, which are then incorporated into the volume rendering. By backpropagating through the rendering loss, we enhance the consistency among neighboring points. Additionally, we propose to use a contrastive loss on the encoder output of the Transformer to further improve consistency within each voxel. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant improvement over different radiance fields in the sparse inputs setting, and achieves comparable performance with current works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laiyan Ding, Panwen Hu, Jie Li, Rui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to jointly infer semantics and occupancies of 3D scenes. Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF), a 3D encoding of depth, has been a common input for SSC. Furthermore, RGB-TSDF fusion, seems promising since these two modalities provide color and geometry information, respectively. Nevertheless, RGB-TSDF fusion has been considered nontrivial and commonly-used naive addition will result in inconsistent results. We argue that the inconsistency comes from the sparsity of RGB features upon projecting into 3D space, while TSDF features are dense, leading to imbalanced feature maps when summed up. To address this RGB-TSDF distribution difference, we propose a two-stage network with a 3D RGB feature completion module that completes RGB features with meaningful values for occluded areas. Moreover, we propose an effective classwise entropy loss function to punish inconsistency. Extensive experiments on public datasets verify that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods that do not adopt extra data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating and animating 3D biped cartoon characters is crucial and valuable in various applications. Compared with geometry, the diverse texture design plays an important role in making 3D biped cartoon characters vivid and charming. Therefore, we focus on automatic texture design for cartoon characters based on input instructions. This is challenging for domain-specific requirements and a lack of high-quality data. To address this challenge, we propose Make-It-Vivid, the first attempt to enable high-quality texture generation from text in UV space. We prepare a detailed text-texture paired data for 3D characters by using vision-question-answering agents. Then we customize a pretrained text-to-image model to generate texture map with template structure while preserving the natural 2D image knowledge. Furthermore, to enhance fine-grained details, we propose a novel adversarial learning scheme to shorten the domain gap between original dataset and realistic texture domain. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current texture generation methods, resulting in efficient character texturing and faithful generation with prompts. Besides, we showcase various applications such as out of domain generation and texture stylization. We also provide an efficient generation system for automatic text-guided textured character generation and animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaywon Koo, Ziyan Yang, Paola Cascante-Bonilla, Baishakhi Ray, Vicente Ordonez</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Programming has emerged as an alternative to end-to-end black-box visual reasoning models. This type of methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose a problem and generate the source code for an executable computer program. This strategy has the advantage of offering an interpretable reasoning path and does not require finetuning a model with task-specific data. We propose PropTest, a general strategy that improves visual programming by further using an LLM to generate code that tests for visual properties in an initial round of proposed solutions. Particularly, our method tests for data-type consistency, as well as syntactic and semantic properties in the generated solutions. Our proposed solution outperforms baselines and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods while using smaller and publicly available LLMs (CodeLlama-7B and WizardCoder-15B). This is demonstrated across different benchmarks on visual question answering and referring expression comprehension, showing the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the performance and generalization of visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, PropTest improves ViperGPT by obtaining 48.66% accuracy (+8.3%) on the A-OKVQA benchmark and 52.8% (+3.3%) on the RefCOCO+ benchmark using CodeLlama-7B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Saeed Ebrahimi Saadabadi, Ali Dabouei, Sahar Rahimi Malakshan, Nasser M. Nasrabad</p>
<p>Abstract: Aiming to enhance the utilization of metric space by the parametric softmax classifier, recent studies suggest replacing it with a non-parametric alternative. Although a non-parametric classifier may provide better metric space utilization, it introduces the challenge of capturing inter-class relationships. A shared characteristic among prior non-parametric classifiers is the static assignment of labels to prototypes during the training, ie, each prototype consistently represents a class throughout the training course. Orthogonal to previous works, we present a simple yet effective method to optimize the category assigned to each prototype (label-to-prototype assignment) during the training. To this aim, we formalize the problem as a two-step optimization objective over network parameters and label-to-prototype assignment mapping. We solve this optimization using a sequential combination of gradient descent and Bipartide matching. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach by conducting experiments on balanced and long-tail classification problems using different backbone network architectures. In particular, our method outperforms its competitors by 1.22\% accuracy on CIFAR-100, and 2.15\% on ImageNet-200 using a metric space dimension half of the size of its competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Zhu, Huimin Ma, Jiansheng Chen, Jian Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved great success in synthesizing high-quality and diverse images given target text prompts. Despite the revolutionary image generation ability, current state-of-the-art models still struggle to deal with multi-concept generation accurately in many cases. This phenomenon is known as ``concept bleeding" and displays as the unexpected overlapping or merging of various concepts. This paper presents a general approach for text-to-image diffusion models to address the mutual interference between different subjects and their attachments in complex scenes, pursuing better text-image consistency. The core idea is to isolate the synthesizing processes of different concepts. We propose to bind each attachment to corresponding subjects separately with split text prompts. Besides, we introduce a revision method to fix the concept bleeding problem in multi-subject synthesis. We first depend on pre-trained object detection and segmentation models to obtain the layouts of subjects. Then we isolate and resynthesize each subject individually with corresponding text prompts to avoid mutual interference. Overall, we achieve a training-free strategy, named Isolated Diffusion, to optimize multi-concept text-to-image synthesis. It is compatible with the latest Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and prior Stable Diffusion (SD) models. We compare our approach with alternative methods using a variety of multi-concept text prompts and demonstrate its effectiveness with clear advantages in text-image consistency and user study.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous driving, particularly for Drivable Area and Lane Segmentation, ensuring safety and navigation. To address the high computational costs of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, this paper introduces TwinLiteNetPlus (TwinLiteNet$^+$), a model adept at balancing efficiency and accuracy. TwinLiteNet$^+$ incorporates standard and depth-wise separable dilated convolutions, reducing complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It is available in four configurations, from the robust 1.94 million-parameter TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Large}}$ to the ultra-compact 34K-parameter TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Nano}}$. Notably, TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Large}}$ attains a 92.9\% mIoU for Drivable Area Segmentation and a 34.2\% IoU for Lane Segmentation. These results notably outperform those of current SOTA models while requiring a computational cost that is approximately 11 times lower in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to the existing SOTA model. Extensively tested on various embedded devices, TwinLiteNet$^+$ demonstrates promising latency and power efficiency, underscoring its suitability for real-world autonomous vehicle applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mulin Yu, Tao Lu, Linning Xu, Lihan Jiang, Yuanbo Xiangli, Bo Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Presenting a 3D scene from multiview images remains a core and long-standing challenge in computer vision and computer graphics. Two main requirements lie in rendering and reconstruction. Notably, SOTA rendering quality is usually achieved with neural volumetric rendering techniques, which rely on aggregated point/primitive-wise color and neglect the underlying scene geometry. Learning of neural implicit surfaces is sparked from the success of neural rendering. Current works either constrain the distribution of density fields or the shape of primitives, resulting in degraded rendering quality and flaws on the learned scene surfaces. The efficacy of such methods is limited by the inherent constraints of the chosen neural representation, which struggles to capture fine surface details, especially for larger, more intricate scenes. To address these issues, we introduce GSDF, a novel dual-branch architecture that combines the benefits of a flexible and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation with neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). The core idea is to leverage and enhance the strengths of each branch while alleviating their limitation through mutual guidance and joint supervision. We show on diverse scenes that our design unlocks the potential for more accurate and detailed surface reconstructions, and at the meantime benefits 3DGS rendering with structures that are more aligned with the underlying geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Dahary, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have an unprecedented ability to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, they often struggle to faithfully capture the intended semantics of complex input prompts that include multiple subjects. Recently, numerous layout-to-image extensions have been introduced to improve user control, aiming to localize subjects represented by specific tokens. Yet, these methods often produce semantically inaccurate images, especially when dealing with multiple semantically or visually similar subjects. In this work, we study and analyze the causes of these limitations. Our exploration reveals that the primary issue stems from inadvertent semantic leakage between subjects in the denoising process. This leakage is attributed to the diffusion model's attention layers, which tend to blend the visual features of different subjects. To address these issues, we introduce Bounded Attention, a training-free method for bounding the information flow in the sampling process. Bounded Attention prevents detrimental leakage among subjects and enables guiding the generation to promote each subject's individuality, even with complex multi-subject conditioning. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method empowers the generation of multiple subjects that better align with given prompts and layouts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models for 2D and 3D content creation have sparked a surge of interest in generating 4D content. However, the scarcity of 3D scene datasets constrains current methodologies to primarily object-centric generation. To overcome this limitation, we present Comp4D, a novel framework for Compositional 4D Generation. Unlike conventional methods that generate a singular 4D representation of the entire scene, Comp4D innovatively constructs each 4D object within the scene separately. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), the framework begins by decomposing an input text prompt into distinct entities and maps out their trajectories. It then constructs the compositional 4D scene by accurately positioning these objects along their designated paths. To refine the scene, our method employs a compositional score distillation technique guided by the pre-defined trajectories, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models across text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate our outstanding 4D content creation capability compared to prior arts, showcasing superior visual quality, motion fidelity, and enhanced object interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pixel Processor Arrays (PPA) present a new vision sensor/processor architecture consisting of a SIMD array of processor elements, each capable of light capture, storage, processing and local communication. Such a device allows visual data to be efficiently stored and manipulated directly upon the focal plane, but also demands the invention of new approaches and algorithms, suitable for the massively-parallel fine-grain processor arrays. In this paper we demonstrate how various image transformations, including shearing, rotation and scaling, can be performed directly upon a PPA. The implementation details are presented using the SCAMP-5 vision chip, that contains a 256x256 pixel-parallel array. Our approaches for performing the image transformations efficiently exploit the parallel computation in a cellular processor array, minimizing the number of SIMD instructions required. These fundamental image transformations are vital building blocks for many visual tasks. This paper aims to serve as a reference for future PPA research while demonstrating the flexibility of PPA architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end driving has made significant progress in recent years, demonstrating benefits such as system simplicity and competitive driving performance under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Nevertheless, the lack of interpretability and controllability in its driving decisions hinders real-world deployment for end-to-end driving systems. In this paper, we collect a comprehensive end-to-end driving dataset named DriveCoT, leveraging the CARLA simulator. It contains sensor data, control decisions, and chain-of-thought labels to indicate the reasoning process. We utilize the challenging driving scenarios from the CARLA leaderboard 2.0, which involve high-speed driving and lane-changing, and propose a rule-based expert policy to control the vehicle and generate ground truth labels for its reasoning process across different driving aspects and the final decisions. This dataset can serve as an open-loop end-to-end driving benchmark, enabling the evaluation of accuracy in various chain-of-thought aspects and the final decision. In addition, we propose a baseline model called DriveCoT-Agent, trained on our dataset, to generate chain-of-thought predictions and final decisions. The trained model exhibits strong performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Composed video retrieval (CoVR) is a challenging problem in computer vision which has recently highlighted the integration of modification text with visual queries for more sophisticated video search in large databases. Existing works predominantly rely on visual queries combined with modification text to distinguish relevant videos. However, such a strategy struggles to fully preserve the rich query-specific context in retrieved target videos and only represents the target video using visual embedding. We introduce a novel CoVR framework that leverages detailed language descriptions to explicitly encode query-specific contextual information and learns discriminative embeddings of vision only, text only and vision-text for better alignment to accurately retrieve matched target videos. Our proposed framework can be flexibly employed for both composed video (CoVR) and image (CoIR) retrieval tasks. Experiments on three datasets show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance for both CovR and zero-shot CoIR tasks, achieving gains as high as around 7% in terms of recall@K=1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanchana Ranasinghe, Xiang Li, Kumara Kahatapitiya, Michael S. Ryoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), known to contain a strong awareness of world knowledge, have allowed recent approaches to achieve excellent performance on Long-Video Understanding benchmarks, but at high inference costs. In this work, we first propose Likelihood Selection, a simple technique that unlocks faster inference in autoregressive LLMs for multiple-choice tasks common in long-video benchmarks. In addition to faster inference, we discover the resulting models to yield surprisingly good accuracy on long-video tasks, even with no video specific information. Building on this, we inject video-specific object-centric information extracted from off-the-shelf pre-trained models and utilize natural language as a medium for information fusion. Our resulting Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across long-video and fine-grained action recognition benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shao, Shengju Qian, Han Xiao, Guanglu Song, Zhuofan Zong, Letian Wang, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Visual CoT, a novel pipeline that leverages the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) by incorporating visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. While MLLMs have shown promise in various visual tasks, they often lack interpretability and struggle with complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn processing pipeline that dynamically focuses on visual inputs and provides interpretable thoughts. We collect and introduce the Visual CoT dataset comprising 373k question-answer pairs, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes highlighting key regions essential for answering the questions. Importantly, the introduced benchmark is capable of evaluating MLLMs in scenarios requiring specific local region identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better inference strategies. The Visual CoT dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available to foster further research in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikai Chen, Fuchen Long, Zhaofan Qiu, Ting Yao, Wengang Zhou, Jiebo Luo, Tao Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are just at a tipping point for image super-resolution task. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to capitalize on diffusion models for video super-resolution which necessitates not only the preservation of visual appearance from low-resolution to high-resolution videos, but also the temporal consistency across video frames. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, pursuing Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence (SATeCo), for video super-resolution. SATeCo pivots on learning spatial-temporal guidance from low-resolution videos to calibrate both latent-space high-resolution video denoising and pixel-space video reconstruction. Technically, SATeCo freezes all the parameters of the pre-trained UNet and VAE, and only optimizes two deliberately-designed spatial feature adaptation (SFA) and temporal feature alignment (TFA) modules, in the decoder of UNet and VAE. SFA modulates frame features via adaptively estimating affine parameters for each pixel, guaranteeing pixel-wise guidance for high-resolution frame synthesis. TFA delves into feature interaction within a 3D local window (tubelet) through self-attention, and executes cross-attention between tubelet and its low-resolution counterpart to guide temporal feature alignment. Extensive experiments conducted on the REDS4 and Vid4 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Yingwei Pan, Haibo Yang, Ting Yao, Tao Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent innovations on text-to-3D generation have featured Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which enables the zero-shot learning of implicit 3D models (NeRF) by directly distilling prior knowledge from 2D diffusion models. However, current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work, we introduce a novel Visual Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation. Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt, VP3D first capitalizes on 2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text, which subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit visual appearance. Meanwhile, we couple the SDS optimization with additional differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text prompt. Through extensive experiments, we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures. It is also appealing in view that when replacing the self-generating visual prompt with a given reference image, VP3D is able to trigger a new task of stylized text-to-3D generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhu, Yingwei Pan, Yehao Li, Ting Yao, Zhenglong Sun, Tao Mei, Chang Wen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as the new trend of generative diffusion models on image generation. In view of extremely slow convergence in typical DiT, recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress, mask strategy still suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and (b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process, resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work, we address these limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge to boost DiT training. Technically, we frame our DiT in a teacher-student manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder, we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and generative objectives. In particular, by encoding discriminative pairs with student and teacher DiT encoders, a new discriminative loss is designed to encourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space. After that, student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset, and our method achieves a competitive balance between training cost and generative capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongwei Zhang, Fuchen Long, Yingwei Pan, Zhaofan Qiu, Ting Yao, Yang Cao, Tao Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have demonstrated the utility of powerful diffusion models. Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when shaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video generation). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion process of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful alignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among adjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of image-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from static image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the coherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the image noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process based on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a residual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that directly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to amplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a residual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent codes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning of the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore, both reference and residual noise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final video generation. Extensive experiments on WebVid-10M, DTDB and MSR-VTT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRIP for image-to-video generation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17006">Invertible Diffusion Models for Compressed Sensing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Chen, Zhenyu Zhang, Weiqi Li, Chen Zhao, Jiwen Yu, Shijie Zhao, Jie Chen, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and finetunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end finetuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) the multi-step sampling process and (2) the noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion model-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kecheng Zheng, Yifei Zhang, Wei Wu, Fan Lu, Shuailei Ma, Xin Jin, Wei Chen, Yujun Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-image pre-training largely relies on how precisely and thoroughly a text describes its paired image. In practice, however, the contents of an image can be so rich that well describing them requires lengthy captions (e.g., with 10 sentences), which are usually missing in existing datasets. Consequently, there are currently no clear evidences on whether and how language-image pre-training could benefit from long captions. To figure this out, we first re-caption 30M images with detailed descriptions using a pre-trained Multi-modality Large Language Model (MLLM), and then study the usage of the resulting captions under a contrastive learning framework. We observe that, each sentence within a long caption is very likely to describe the image partially (e.g., an object). Motivated by this, we propose to dynamically sample sub-captions from the text label to construct multiple positive pairs, and introduce a grouping loss to match the embeddings of each sub-caption with its corresponding local image patches in a self-supervised manner. Experimental results on a wide rage of downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method, termed DreamLIP, over previous alternatives, highlighting its fine-grained representational capacity. It is noteworthy that, on the tasks of image-text retrieval and semantic segmentation, our model trained with 30M image-text pairs achieves on par or even better performance than CLIP trained with 400M pairs.

<p>Abstract: This work presents FlashFace, a practical tool with which users can easily personalize their own photos on the fly by providing one or a few reference face images and a text prompt. Our approach is distinguishable from existing human photo customization methods by higher-fidelity identity preservation and better instruction following, benefiting from two subtle designs. First, we encode the face identity into a series of feature maps instead of one image token as in prior arts, allowing the model to retain more details of the reference faces (e.g., scars, tattoos, and face shape ). Second, we introduce a disentangled integration strategy to balance the text and image guidance during the text-to-image generation process, alleviating the conflict between the reference faces and the text prompts (e.g., personalizing an adult into a "child" or an "elder"). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various applications, including human image personalization, face swapping under language prompts, making virtual characters into real people, etc. Project Page: https://jshilong.github.io/flashface-page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Li, Lingdong Kong, Hanjiang Hu, Xiaohao Xu, Xiaonan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The robustness of driving perception systems under unprecedented conditions is crucial for safety-critical usages. Latest advancements have prompted increasing interests towards multi-LiDAR perception. However, prevailing driving datasets predominantly utilize single-LiDAR systems and collect data devoid of adverse conditions, failing to capture the complexities of real-world environments accurately. Addressing these gaps, we proposed Place3D, a full-cycle pipeline that encompasses LiDAR placement optimization, data generation, and downstream evaluations. Our framework makes three appealing contributions. 1) To identify the most effective configurations for multi-LiDAR systems, we introduce a Surrogate Metric of the Semantic Occupancy Grids (M-SOG) to evaluate LiDAR placement quality. 2) Leveraging the M-SOG metric, we propose a novel optimization strategy to refine multi-LiDAR placements. 3) Centered around the theme of multi-condition multi-LiDAR perception, we collect a 364,000-frame dataset from both clean and adverse conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiDAR placements optimized using our approach outperform various baselines. We showcase exceptional robustness in both 3D object detection and LiDAR semantic segmentation tasks, under diverse adverse weather and sensor failure conditions.

<p>Abstract: Safety-critical 3D scene understanding tasks necessitate not only accurate but also confident predictions from 3D perception models. This study introduces Calib3D, a pioneering effort to benchmark and scrutinize the reliability of 3D scene understanding models from an uncertainty estimation viewpoint. We comprehensively evaluate 28 state-of-the-art models across 10 diverse 3D datasets, uncovering insightful phenomena that cope with both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in 3D scene understanding. We discover that despite achieving impressive levels of accuracy, existing models frequently fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates -- a pitfall that critically undermines their applicability in safety-sensitive contexts. Through extensive analysis of key factors such as network capacity, LiDAR representations, rasterization resolutions, and 3D data augmentation techniques, we correlate these aspects directly with the model calibration efficacy. Furthermore, we introduce DeptS, a novel depth-aware scaling approach aimed at enhancing 3D model calibration. Extensive experiments across a wide range of configurations validate the superiority of our method. We hope this work could serve as a cornerstone for fostering reliable 3D scene understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current research on human activity recognition (HAR) mainly assumes that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution to achieve a generalised model, which means all the data are considered to be independent and identically distributed $\displaystyle (i.i.d.) $. In many real-world applications, this assumption does not hold, and collected training and target testing datasets have non-uniform distribution, such as in the case of cross-user HAR. Domain adaptation is a promising approach for cross-user HAR tasks. Existing domain adaptation works based on the assumption that samples in each domain are $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ and do not consider the knowledge of temporal relation hidden in time series data for aligning data distribution. This strong assumption of $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ may not be suitable for time series-related domain adaptation methods because the samples formed by time series segmentation and feature extraction techniques are only coarse approximations to $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ assumption in each domain. In this paper, we propose the temporal relation optimal transport (TROT) method to utilise temporal relation and relax the $\displaystyle i.i.d. $ assumption for the samples in each domain for accurate and efficient knowledge transfer. We obtain the temporal relation representation and implement temporal relation alignment of activities via the Hidden Markov model (HMM) and optimal transport (OT) techniques. Besides, a new regularisation term that preserves temporal relation order information for an improved optimal transport mapping is proposed to enhance the domain adaptation performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three public activity recognition datasets (i.e. OPPT, PAMAP2 and DSADS), demonstrating that TROT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou Ye, Waleed H. Abdulla, Nirmal Nair, Kevin I-Kai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a cornerstone of ubiquitous computing, with promising applications in diverse fields such as health monitoring and ambient assisted living. Despite significant advancements, sensor-based HAR methods often operate under the assumption that training and testing data have identical distributions. However, in many real-world scenarios, particularly in sensor-based HAR, this assumption is invalidated by out-of-distribution ($\displaystyle o.o.d.$) challenges, including differences from heterogeneous sensors, change over time, and individual behavioural variability. This paper centres on the latter, exploring the cross-user HAR problem where behavioural variability across individuals results in differing data distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce the Deep Temporal State Domain Adaptation (DTSDA) model, an innovative approach tailored for time series domain adaptation in cross-user HAR. Contrary to the common assumption of sample independence in existing domain adaptation approaches, DTSDA recognizes and harnesses the inherent temporal relations in the data. Therefore, we introduce 'Temporal State', a concept that defined the different sub-activities within an activity, consistent across different users. We ensure these sub-activities follow a logical time sequence through 'Temporal Consistency' property and propose the 'Pseudo Temporal State Labeling' method to identify the user-invariant temporal relations. Moreover, the design principle of DTSDA integrates adversarial learning for better domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on three HAR datasets demonstrate DTSDA's superior performance in cross-user HAR applications by briding individual behavioral variability using temporal relations across sub-activities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, offering utility not only for interacting with machines but also for facilitating communication for individuals with either partial or profound hearing impairments. The process involves receiving the speech signal in analogue form, followed by various signal processing algorithms to make it compatible with devices of limited capacity, such as cochlear implants (CIs). Unfortunately, these implants, equipped with a finite number of electrodes, often result in speech distortion during synthesis. Despite efforts by researchers to enhance received speech quality using various state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, challenges persist, especially in scenarios involving multiple sources of speech, environmental noise, and other circumstances. The advent of new artificial intelligence (AI) methods has ushered in cutting-edge strategies to address the limitations and difficulties associated with traditional signal processing techniques dedicated to CIs. This review aims to comprehensively review advancements in CI-based ASR and speech enhancement, among other related aspects. The primary objective is to provide a thorough overview of metrics and datasets, exploring the capabilities of AI algorithms in this biomedical field, summarizing and commenting on the best results obtained. Additionally, the review will delve into potential applications and suggest future directions to bridge existing research gaps in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arezoo Borji, Taha-Hossein Hejazi, Abbas Seifi</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behavior. In this disease, there is a critical phase, mild cognitive impairment, that is really important to be diagnosed early since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. This study delves into the challenging task of classifying Alzheimer's disease into four distinct groups: control normal (CN), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This classification is based on a thorough examination of PET scan images obtained from the ADNI dataset, which provides a thorough understanding of the disease's progression. Several deep-learning and traditional machine-learning models have been used to detect Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, three deep-learning models, namely VGG16 and AlexNet, and a custom Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 8-fold cross-validation have been used for classification. Finally, an ensemble technique is used to improve the overall result of these models. The results show that using deep-learning models to tell the difference between MCI patients gives an overall average accuracy of 93.13% and an AUC of 94.4%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite living in a multi-sensory world, most AI models are limited to textual and visual understanding of human motion and behavior. In fact, full situational awareness of human motion could best be understood through a combination of sensors. In this survey we investigate how knowledge can be transferred and utilized amongst modalities for Human Activity/Action Recognition (HAR), i.e. cross-modality transfer learning. We motivate the importance and potential of IMU data and its applicability in cross-modality learning as well as the importance of studying the HAR problem. We categorize HAR related tasks by time and abstractness and then compare various types of multimodal HAR datasets. We also distinguish and expound on many related but inconsistently used terms in the literature, such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, representation learning, sensor fusion, and multimodal learning, and describe how cross-modal learning fits with all these concepts. We then review the literature in IMU-based cross-modal transfer for HAR. The two main approaches for cross-modal transfer are instance-based transfer, where instances of one modality are mapped to another (e.g. knowledge is transferred in the input space), or feature-based transfer, where the model relates the modalities in an intermediate latent space (e.g. knowledge is transferred in the feature space). Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications in cross-modal HAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeill Kim, Wonseok Lee, Moonjung Eo, Wonjong Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) constitutes a pivotal subfield within continual learning, aimed at enabling models to progressively learn new classification tasks while retaining knowledge obtained from prior tasks. Although previous studies have predominantly focused on backward compatible approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, recent investigations have introduced forward compatible methods to enhance performance on novel tasks and complement existing backward compatible methods. In this study, we introduce an effective-Rank based Feature Richness enhancement (RFR) method, designed for improving forward compatibility. Specifically, this method increases the effective rank of representations during the base session, thereby facilitating the incorporation of more informative features pertinent to unseen novel tasks. Consequently, RFR achieves dual objectives in backward and forward compatibility: minimizing feature extractor modifications and enhancing novel task performance, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we establish a theoretical connection between effective rank and the Shannon entropy of representations. Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive experiments by integrating RFR into eleven well-known CIL methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing novel-task performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our method notably improves the average incremental accuracy across all eleven cases examined.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continuous advancements in medical technology have led to the creation of affordable mobile imaging devices suitable for telemedicine and remote monitoring. However, the rapid examination of large populations poses challenges, including the risk of fraudulent practices by healthcare professionals and social workers exchanging unverified images via mobile applications. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes using watermarking techniques to embed a device fingerprint (DFP) into captured images, ensuring data provenance. The DFP, representing the unique attributes of the capturing device and raw image, is embedded into raw images before storage, thus enabling verification of image authenticity and source. Moreover, a robust remote validation method is introduced to authenticate images, enhancing the integrity of medical image data in interconnected healthcare systems. Through a case study on mobile fundus imaging, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated in terms of computational efficiency, image quality, security, and trustworthiness. This approach is suitable for a range of applications, including telemedicine, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), eHealth, and Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) applications, providing a reliable means to maintain data provenance in diagnostic settings utilizing medical images or videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Lucke, Aleksandar Vakanski, Min Xian</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of breast ultrasound (BUS) images have shown great success; however, two major challenges still exist. 1) Most current approaches inherently lack the ability to utilize tissue anatomy, resulting in misclassified image regions. 2) They struggle to produce accurate boundaries due to the repeated down-sampling operations. To address these issues, we propose a novel breast anatomy-aware network for capturing fine image details and a new smoothness term that encodes breast anatomy. It incorporates context information across multiple spatial scales to generate more accurate semantic boundaries. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method and eight state-of-the-art approaches using a BUS dataset with 325 images. The results demonstrate the proposed method significantly improves the segmentation of the muscle, mammary, and tumor classes and produces more accurate fine details of tissue boundaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shambhavi Mishra, Balamurali Murugesan, Ismail Ben Ayed, Marco Pedersoli, Jose Dolz</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches rely on highly confident predictions to serve as pseudo-labels that guide the training on unlabeled samples. An inherent drawback of this strategy stems from the quality of the uncertainty estimates, as pseudo-labels are filtered only based on their degree of uncertainty, regardless of the correctness of their predictions. Thus, assessing and enhancing the uncertainty of network predictions is of paramount importance in the pseudo-labeling process. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that SSL methods based on pseudo-labels are significantly miscalibrated, and formally demonstrate the minimization of the min-entropy, a lower bound of the Shannon entropy, as a potential cause for miscalibration. To alleviate this issue, we integrate a simple penalty term, which enforces the logit distances of the predictions on unlabeled samples to remain low, preventing the network predictions to become overconfident. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of SSL image classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed solution systematically improves the calibration performance of relevant SSL models, while also enhancing their discriminative power, being an appealing addition to tackle SSL tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepehr Sabeti, Fatemeh Banani Ardacani, Omidreza Shoghli</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the aging highway infrastructure requiring extensive rebuilding and enhancements, and the consequent rise in the number of work zones, there is an urgent need to develop advanced safety systems to protect workers. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant potential for delivering warnings to workers, its integration into roadway work zones remains relatively unexplored. The primary objective of this study is to improve safety measures within roadway work zones by conducting an extensive analysis of how different combinations of multimodal AR warnings influence the reaction times of workers. This paper addresses this gap through a series of experiments that aim to replicate the distinctive conditions of roadway work zones, both in real-world and virtual reality environments. Our approach comprises three key components: an advanced AR system prototype, a VR simulation of AR functionality within the work zone environment, and the Wizard of Oz technique to synchronize user experiences across experiments. To assess reaction times, we leverage both the simple reaction time (SRT) technique and an innovative vision-based metric that utilizes real-time pose estimation. By conducting five experiments in controlled outdoor work zones and indoor VR settings, our study provides valuable information on how various multimodal AR warnings impact workers reaction times. Furthermore, our findings reveal the disparities in reaction times between VR simulations and real-world scenarios, thereby gauging VR's capability to mirror the dynamics of roadway work zones. Furthermore, our results substantiate the potential and reliability of vision-based reaction time measurements. These insights resonate well with those derived using the SRT technique, underscoring the viability of this approach for tangible real-world uses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cosmin Ciausu, Deepa Krishnaswamy, Benjamin Billot, Steve Pieper, Ron Kikinis, Andrey Fedorov</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has shown great promise in the ability to automatically annotate organs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, for example, of the brain. However, despite advancements in the field, the ability to accurately segment abdominal organs remains difficult across MR. In part, this may be explained by the much greater variability in image appearance and severely limited availability of training labels. The inherent nature of computed tomography (CT) scans makes it easier to annotate, resulting in a larger availability of expert annotations for the latter. We leverage a modality-agnostic domain randomization approach, utilizing CT label maps to generate synthetic images on-the-fly during training, further used to train a U-Net segmentation network for abdominal organs segmentation. Our approach shows comparable results compared to fully-supervised segmentation methods trained on MR data. Our method results in Dice scores of 0.90 (0.08) and 0.91 (0.08) for the right and left kidney respectively, compared to a pretrained nnU-Net model yielding 0.87 (0.20) and 0.91 (0.03). We will make our code publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiping Zhuang, Yizhu Chen, Di Fang, Run He, Kai Tong, Hongxin Wei, Ziqian Zeng, Cen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) trains a network on sequential tasks with separated categories but suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models quickly lose previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. The generalized CIL (GCIL) aims to address the CIL problem in a more real-world scenario, where incoming data have mixed data categories and unknown sample size distribution, leading to intensified forgetting. Existing attempts for the GCIL either have poor performance, or invade data privacy by saving historical exemplars. To address this, in this paper, we propose an exemplar-free generalized analytic class incremental learning (G-ACIL). The G-ACIL adopts analytic learning (a gradient-free training technique), and delivers an analytical solution (i.e., closed-form) to the GCIL scenario. This solution is derived via decomposing the incoming data into exposed and unexposed classes, allowing an equivalence between the incremental learning and its joint training, i.e., the weight-invariant property. Such an equivalence is theoretically validated through matrix analysis tools, and hence contributes interpretability in GCIL. It is also empirically evidenced by experiments on various datasets and settings of GCIL. The results show that the G-ACIL exhibits leading performance with high robustness compared with existing competitive GCIL methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrihari Sridharan, Surya Selvam, Kaushik Roy, Anand Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras have emerged as a promising sensing modality for autonomous navigation systems, owing to their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range and negligible motion blur. To process the asynchronous temporal event streams from such sensors, recent research has shown that a mix of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as well as hybrid SNN-ANN algorithms are necessary to achieve high accuracies across a range of perception tasks. However, we observe that executing such workloads on commodity edge platforms which feature heterogeneous processing elements such as CPUs, GPUs and neural accelerators results in inferior performance. This is due to the mismatch between the irregular nature of event streams and diverse characteristics of algorithms on the one hand and the underlying hardware platform on the other. We propose Ev-Edge, a framework that contains three key optimizations to boost the performance of event-based vision systems on edge platforms: (1) An Event2Sparse Frame converter directly transforms raw event streams into sparse frames, enabling the use of sparse libraries with minimal encoding overheads (2) A Dynamic Sparse Frame Aggregator merges sparse frames at runtime by trading off the temporal granularity of events and computational demand thereby improving hardware utilization (3) A Network Mapper maps concurrently executing tasks to different processing elements while also selecting layer precision by considering both compute and communication overheads. On several state-of-art networks for a range of autonomous navigation tasks, Ev-Edge achieves 1.28x-2.05x improvements in latency and 1.23x-2.15x in energy over an all-GPU implementation on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform for single-task execution scenarios. Ev-Edge also achieves 1.43x-1.81x latency improvements over round-robin scheduling methods in multi-task execution scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Yang, Xianhang Li, Jieru Mei, Jieneng Chen, Cihang Xie, Yuyin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmenting brain tumors is complex due to their diverse appearances and scales. Brain metastases, the most common type of brain tumor, are a frequent complication of cancer. Therefore, an effective segmentation model for brain metastases must adeptly capture local intricacies to delineate small tumor regions while also integrating global context to understand broader scan features. The TransUNet model, which combines Transformer self-attention with U-Net's localized information, emerges as a promising solution for this task. In this report, we address brain metastases segmentation by training the 3D-TransUNet model on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS-METS) 2023 challenge dataset. Specifically, we explored two architectural configurations: the Encoder-only 3D-TransUNet, employing Transformers solely in the encoder, and the Decoder-only 3D-TransUNet, utilizing Transformers exclusively in the decoder. For Encoder-only 3D-TransUNet, we note that Masked-Autoencoder pre-training is required for a better initialization of the Transformer Encoder and thus accelerates the training process. We identify that the Decoder-only 3D-TransUNet model should offer enhanced efficacy in the segmentation of brain metastases, as indicated by our 5-fold cross-validation on the training set. However, our use of the Encoder-only 3D-TransUNet model already yield notable results, with an average lesion-wise Dice score of 59.8\% on the test set, securing second place in the BraTS-METS 2023 challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishant Kumar, Ziyan Tao, Jaikirat Singh, Yang Li, Peiwen Sun, Binghui Zhao, Stefan Gumhold</p>
<p>Abstract: Image fusion typically employs non-invertible neural networks to merge multiple source images into a single fused image. However, for clinical experts, solely relying on fused images may be insufficient for making diagnostic decisions, as the fusion mechanism blends features from source images, thereby making it difficult to interpret the underlying tumor pathology. We introduce FusionINN, a novel invertible image fusion framework, capable of efficiently generating fused images and also decomposing them back to the source images by solving the inverse of the fusion process. FusionINN guarantees lossless one-to-one pixel mapping by integrating a normally distributed latent image alongside the fused image to facilitate the generative modeling of the decomposition process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the decomposability of fused images, which is particularly crucial for life-sensitive applications such as medical image fusion compared to other tasks like multi-focus or multi-exposure image fusion. Our extensive experimentation validates FusionINN over existing discriminative and generative fusion methods, both subjectively and objectively. Moreover, compared to a recent denoising diffusion-based fusion model, our approach offers faster and qualitatively better fusion results. We also exhibit the clinical utility of our results in aiding disease prognosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongsen Li, Wenxuan Chen, Shuai Wang, Chuyu Liu, Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can act as a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). In recent years, DIP has been utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually utilize a single pyramid-shaped CNN architecture to parameterize the generator, which cannot effectively exploit the spatio-temporal correlations within the dynamic data. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to exploit the DIP prior for dynamic MRI reconstruction, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). The generative model is decomposed into two stages: image recovery and manifold discovery, which is bridged by a graph convolutional network to exploit the spatio-temporal correlations. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to further improve the reconstruction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and unsupervised methods over different sampling trajectories, and significantly reduces the performance gap with the state-of-art supervised deep-learning methods. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruige Zong, Tao Wang, Chunwang Li, Xinlin Zhang, Yuanbin Chen, Longxuan Zhao, Qixuan Li, Qinquan Gao, Dezhi Kang, Fuxin Lin, Tong Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Familial cerebral cavernous malformation (FCCM) is a hereditary disorder characterized by abnormal vascular structures within the central nervous system. The FCCM lesions are often numerous and intricate, making quantitative analysis of the lesions a labor-intensive task. Consequently, clinicians face challenges in quantitatively assessing the severity of lesions and determining whether lesions have progressed. To alleviate this problem, we propose a quantitative statistical framework for FCCM, comprising an efficient annotation module, an FCCM lesion segmentation module, and an FCCM lesion quantitative statistics module. Our framework demonstrates precise segmentation of the FCCM lesion based on efficient data annotation, achieving a Dice coefficient of 93.22\%. More importantly, we focus on quantitative statistics of lesions, which is combined with image registration to realize the quantitative comparison of lesions between different examinations of patients, and a visualization framework has been established for doctors to comprehensively compare and analyze lesions. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed framework not only obtains objective, accurate, and comprehensive quantitative statistical information, which provides a quantitative assessment method for disease progression and drug efficacy study, but also considerably reduces the manual measurement and statistical workload of lesions, assisting clinical decision-making for FCCM and accelerating progress in FCCM clinical research. This highlights the potential of practical application of the framework in FCCM clinical research and clinical decision-making.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kesheng Wang, Kunhui Xu, Xiaoyu Chen, Chunlei He, Jianfeng Zhang, Dexing Kong, Qi Dai, Shoujun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic measurements of tear meniscus height (TMH) have been achieved by using deep learning techniques; however, annotation is significantly influenced by subjective factors and is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce an automatic TMH measurement technique based on edge detection-assisted annotation within a deep learning framework. This method generates mask labels less affected by subjective factors with enhanced efficiency compared to previous annotation approaches. For improved segmentation of the pupil and tear meniscus areas, the convolutional neural network Inceptionv3 was first implemented as an image quality assessment model, effectively identifying higher-quality images with an accuracy of 98.224%. Subsequently, by using the generated labels, various algorithms, including Unet, ResUnet, Deeplabv3+FcnResnet101, Deeplabv3+FcnResnet50, FcnResnet50, and FcnResnet101 were trained, with Unet demonstrating the best performance. Finally, Unet was used for automatic pupil and tear meniscus segmentation to locate the center of the pupil and calculate TMH,respectively. An evaluation of the mask quality predicted by Unet indicated a Mean Intersection over Union of 0.9362, a recall of 0.9261, a precision of 0.9423, and an F1-Score of 0.9326. Additionally, the TMH predicted by the model was assessed, with the fitting curve represented as y= 0.982x-0.862, an overall correlation coefficient of r^2=0.961 , and an accuracy of 94.80% (237/250). In summary, the algorithm can automatically screen images based on their quality,segment the pupil and tear meniscus areas, and automatically measure TMH. Measurement results using the AI algorithm demonstrate a high level of consistency with manual measurements, offering significant support to clinical doctors in diagnosing dry eye disease.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, automated medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning have achieved great success. However, they heavily rely on large annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Few-shot learning aims to overcome the need for annotated data by using a small labeled dataset, known as a support set, to guide predicting labels for new, unlabeled images, known as the query set. Inspired by this paradigm, we introduce MatchSeg, a novel framework that enhances medical image segmentation through strategic reference image matching. We leverage contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to select highly relevant samples when defining the support set. Additionally, we design a joint attention module to strengthen the interaction between support and query features, facilitating a more effective knowledge transfer between support and query sets. We validated our method across four public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior segmentation performance and powerful domain generalization ability of MatchSeg against existing methods for domain-specific and cross-domain segmentation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushan Huang, Josh Millar, Yuxuan Long, Yuchen Zhao, Hamed Hadaddi</p>
<p>Abstract: The personalization of machine learning (ML) models to address data drift is a significant challenge in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Presently, most approaches focus on fine-tuning either the full base model or its last few layers to adapt to new data, while often neglecting energy costs. However, various types of data drift exist, and fine-tuning the full base model or the last few layers may not result in optimal performance in certain scenarios. We propose Target Block Fine-Tuning (TBFT), a low-energy adaptive personalization framework designed for resource-constrained devices. We categorize data drift and personalization into three types: input-level, feature-level, and output-level. For each type, we fine-tune different blocks of the model to achieve optimal performance with reduced energy costs. Specifically, input-, feature-, and output-level correspond to fine-tuning the front, middle, and rear blocks of the model. We evaluate TBFT on a ResNet model, three datasets, three different training sizes, and a Raspberry Pi. Compared with the $Block Avg$, where each block is fine-tuned individually and their performance improvements are averaged, TBFT exhibits an improvement in model accuracy by an average of 15.30% whilst saving 41.57% energy consumption on average compared with full fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Z. Ren, Jaden Clark, Anushri Dixit, Masha Itkina, Anirudha Majumdar, Dorsa Sadigh</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), which refers to settings where an embodied agent such as a robot needs to actively explore an environment to gather information until it is confident about the answer to a question. In this work, we leverage the strong semantic reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to efficiently explore and answer such questions. However, there are two main challenges when using VLMs in EQA: they do not have an internal memory for mapping the scene to be able to plan how to explore over time, and their confidence can be miscalibrated and can cause the robot to prematurely stop exploration or over-explore. We propose a method that first builds a semantic map of the scene based on depth information and via visual prompting of a VLM - leveraging its vast knowledge of relevant regions of the scene for exploration. Next, we use conformal prediction to calibrate the VLM's question answering confidence, allowing the robot to know when to stop exploration - leading to a more calibrated and efficient exploration strategy. To test our framework in simulation, we also contribute a new EQA dataset with diverse, realistic human-robot scenarios and scenes built upon the Habitat-Matterport 3D Research Dataset (HM3D). Both simulated and real robot experiments show our proposed approach improves the performance and efficiency over baselines that do no leverage VLM for exploration or do not calibrate its confidence.

<p>Abstract: This paper describes CBGT-Net, a neural network model inspired by the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuits found in mammalian brains. Unlike traditional neural network models, which either generate an output for each provided input, or an output after a fixed sequence of inputs, the CBGT-Net learns to produce an output after a sufficient criteria for evidence is achieved from a stream of observed data. For each observation, the CBGT-Net generates a vector that explicitly represents the amount of evidence the observation provides for each potential decision, accumulates the evidence over time, and generates a decision when the accumulated evidence exceeds a pre-defined threshold. We evaluate the proposed model on two image classification tasks, where models need to predict image categories based on a stream of small patches extracted from the image. We show that the CBGT-Net provides improved accuracy and robustness compared to models trained to classify from a single patch, and models leveraging an LSTM layer to classify from a fixed sequence length of patches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Wang, Wenhai Liu, Qiaojun Yu, Yang You, Liu Liu, Weiming Wang, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated objects are commonly found in daily life. It is essential that robots can exhibit robust perception and manipulation skills for articulated objects in real-world robotic applications. However, existing methods for articulated objects insufficiently address noise in point clouds and struggle to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, thus limiting the practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework towards Robust Perception and Manipulation for Articulated Objects (RPMArt), which learns to estimate the articulation parameters and manipulate the articulation part from the noisy point cloud. Our primary contribution is a Robust Articulation Network (RoArtNet) that is able to predict both joint parameters and affordable points robustly by local feature learning and point tuple voting. Moreover, we introduce an articulation-aware classification scheme to enhance its ability for sim-to-real transfer. Finally, with the estimated affordable point and articulation joint constraint, the robot can generate robust actions to manipulate articulated objects. After learning only from synthetic data, RPMArt is able to transfer zero-shot to real-world articulated objects. Experimental results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving state-of-the-art performance in both noise-added simulation and real-world environments. The code and data will be open-sourced for reproduction. More results are published on the project website at https://r-pmart.github.io .</p>

Stable-diffusion processes play a crucial role in various scientific and engineering domains, and their acceleration is of paramount importance for efficient computational performance. The standard iterative procedures for solving fixed-source discrete ordinates problems often exhibit slow convergence, particularly in optically thick scenarios. To address this challenge, unconditionally stable diffusion-acceleration methods have been developed, aiming to enhance the computational efficiency of transport equations and discrete ordinates problems. This study delves into the theoretical foundations and numerical results of unconditionally stable diffusion synthetic acceleration methods, providing insights into their stability and performance for model discrete ordinates problems. Furthermore, the paper explores recent advancements in diffusion model acceleration, including on device acceleration of large diffusion models via gpu aware optimizations, highlighting the potential for significantly improved inference latency. The results and analyses in this study provide important insights into stable diffusion processes and have important ramifications for the creation and application of acceleration methods specifically, the lcm-lora module in a variety of computing environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linzhi Wu, Xingyu Zhang, Yakun Zhang, Changyan Zheng, Tiejun Liu, Liang Xie, Ye Yan, Erwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip reading, the process of interpreting silent speech from visual lip movements, has gained rising attention for its wide range of realistic applications. Deep learning approaches greatly improve current lip reading systems. However, lip reading in cross-speaker scenarios where the speaker identity changes, poses a challenging problem due to inter-speaker variability. A well-trained lip reading system may perform poorly when handling a brand new speaker. To learn a speaker-robust lip reading model, a key insight is to reduce visual variations across speakers, avoiding the model overfitting to specific speakers. In this work, in view of both input visual clues and latent representations based on a hybrid CTC/attention architecture, we propose to exploit the lip landmark-guided fine-grained visual clues instead of frequently-used mouth-cropped images as input features, diminishing speaker-specific appearance characteristics. Furthermore, a max-min mutual information regularization approach is proposed to capture speaker-insensitive latent representations. Experimental evaluations on public lip reading datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the intra-speaker and inter-speaker conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhisek Ray, Gaurav Kumar, Maheshkumar H. Kolekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of image super-resolution (SR) by harnessing their inherent ability to capture complex contextual features. The overlapping rectangular shifted window technique used in transformer architecture nowadays is a common practice in super-resolution models to improve the quality and robustness of image upscaling. However, it suffers from distortion at the boundaries and has limited unique shifting modes. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a non-overlapping triangular window technique that synchronously works with the rectangular one to mitigate boundary-level distortion and allows the model to access more unique sifting modes. In this paper, we propose a Composite Fusion Attention Transformer (CFAT) that incorporates triangular-rectangular window-based local attention with a channel-based global attention technique in image super-resolution. As a result, CFAT enables attention mechanisms to be activated on more image pixels and captures long-range, multi-scale features to improve SR performance. The extensive experimental results and ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness of CFAT in the SR domain. Our proposed model shows a significant 0.7 dB performance improvement over other state-of-the-art SR architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Zhang, Zhaomeng Zhang, Yihao Liu, Yaqian Chen, Amir Kheradmand, Mehran Armand</p>
<p>Abstract: Realtime shape estimation of continuum objects and manipulators is essential for developing accurate planning and control paradigms. The existing methods that create dense point clouds from camera images, and/or use distinguishable markers on a deformable body have limitations in realtime tracking of large continuum objects/manipulators. The physical occlusion of markers can often compromise accurate shape estimation. We propose a robust method to estimate the shape of linear deformable objects in realtime using scattered and unordered key points. By utilizing a robust probability-based labeling algorithm, our approach identifies the true order of the detected key points and then reconstructs the shape using piecewise spline interpolation. The approach only relies on knowing the number of the key points and the interval between two neighboring points. We demonstrate the robustness of the method when key points are partially occluded. The proposed method is also integrated into a simulation in Unity for tracking the shape of a cable with a length of 1m and a radius of 5mm. The simulation results show that our proposed approach achieves an average length error of 1.07% over the continuum's centerline and an average cross-section error of 2.11mm. The real-world experiments of tracking and estimating a heavy-load cable prove that the proposed approach is robust under occlusion and complex entanglement scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arindam Majee, Avisek Gupta, Sourav Raha, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, presents a formidable global health challenge, underscoring the critical importance of early and precise diagnosis for timely interventions and enhanced patient outcomes. While MRI scans provide valuable insights into brain structures, traditional analysis methods often struggle to discern intricate 3D patterns crucial for AD identification. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an alternative end-to-end deep learning model, the 3D Hybrid Compact Convolutional Transformers 3D (HCCT). By synergistically combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the 3D HCCT adeptly captures both local features and long-range relationships within 3D MRI scans. Extensive evaluations on prominent AD benchmark dataset, ADNI, demonstrate the 3D HCCT's superior performance, surpassing state of the art CNN and transformer-based methods in classification accuracy. Its robust generalization capability and interpretability marks a significant stride in AD classification from 3D MRI scans, promising more accurate and reliable diagnoses for improved patient care and superior clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of deep fair clustering, which partitions data into clusters via the representations extracted by deep neural networks while hiding sensitive data attributes. To achieve fairness, existing methods present a variety of fairness-related objective functions based on the group fairness criterion. However, these works typically assume that the sensitive attributes are discrete and do not work for continuous sensitive variables, such as the proportion of the female population in an area. Besides, the potential of the representations learned from clustering tasks to improve performance on other tasks is ignored by existing works. In light of these limitations, we propose a flexible deep fair clustering method that can handle discrete and continuous sensitive attributes simultaneously. Specifically, we design an information bottleneck style objective function to learn fair and clustering-friendly representations. Furthermore, we explore for the first time the transferability of the extracted representations to other downstream tasks. Unlike existing works, we impose fairness at the representation level, which could guarantee fairness for the transferred task regardless of clustering results. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on datasets with discrete and continuous sensitive attributes, demonstrating the advantage of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojie Li, Haichen Qu, Xinqi Dong, Bo Dang, Hengyi Zang, Yulu Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the application of deep learning technologies in the field of medical diagnostics, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a unique perspective for observing and diagnosing complex neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer Disease (AD). With advancements in deep learning, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Xception network architecture, we are now able to analyze and classify vast amounts of MRI data with unprecedented accuracy. The progress of this technology not only enhances our understanding of brain structural changes but also opens up new avenues for monitoring disease progression through non-invasive means and potentially allows for precise diagnosis in the early stages of the disease.
  This study aims to classify MRI images using deep learning models to identify different stages of Alzheimer Disease through a series of innovative data processing and model construction steps. Our experimental results show that the deep learning framework based on the Xception model achieved a 99.6% accuracy rate in the multi-class MRI image classification task, demonstrating its potential application value in assistive diagnosis. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, improving model interpretability, and clinical validation to further promote the application of deep learning technology in the medical field, with the hope of bringing earlier diagnosis and more personalized treatment plans to Alzheimer Disease patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Che-Jui Chang, Danrui Li, Seonghyeon Moon, Mubbasir Kapadia</p>
<p>Abstract: We study, from an empirical standpoint, the efficacy of synthetic data in real-world scenarios. Leveraging synthetic data for training perception models has become a key strategy embraced by the community due to its efficiency, scalability, perfect annotations, and low costs. Despite proven advantages, few studies put their stress on how to efficiently generate synthetic datasets to solve real-world problems and to what extent synthetic data can reduce the effort for real-world data collection. To answer the questions, we systematically investigate several interesting properties of synthetic data -- the equivalency of synthetic data to real-world data, the substitutability of synthetic data for real data, and the flexibility of synthetic data generators to close up domain gaps. Leveraging the M3Act synthetic data generator, we conduct experiments on DanceTrack and MOT17. Our results suggest that synthetic data not only enhances model performance but also demonstrates substitutability for real data, with 60% to 80% replacement without performance loss. In addition, our study of the impact of synthetic data distributions on downstream performance reveals the importance of flexible data generators in narrowing domain gaps for improved model adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhodip Panda, Shashwat Sourav, Prathosh A. P</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to adhere to regulatory standards governing individual data privacy and safety, machine learning models must systematically eliminate information derived from specific subsets of a user's training data that can no longer be utilized. The emerging discipline of Machine Unlearning has arisen as a pivotal area of research, facilitating the process of selectively discarding information designated to specific sets or classes of data from a pre-trained model, thereby eliminating the necessity for extensive retraining from scratch. The principal aim of this study is to formulate a methodology tailored for the purposeful elimination of information linked to a specific class of data from a pre-trained classification network. This intentional removal is crafted to degrade the model's performance specifically concerning the unlearned data class while concurrently minimizing any detrimental impacts on the model's performance in other classes. To achieve this goal, we frame the class unlearning problem from a Bayesian perspective, which yields a loss function that minimizes the log-likelihood associated with the unlearned data with a stability regularization in parameter space. This stability regularization incorporates Mohalanobis distance with respect to the Fisher Information matrix and $l_2$ distance from the pre-trained model parameters. Our novel approach, termed \textbf{Partially-Blinded Unlearning (PBU)}, surpasses existing state-of-the-art class unlearning methods, demonstrating superior effectiveness. Notably, PBU achieves this efficacy without requiring awareness of the entire training dataset but only to the unlearned data points, marking a distinctive feature of its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atefeh Khoshkhahtinat, Ali Zafari, Piyush M. Mehta, Nasser M. Nasrabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: While replacing Gaussian decoders with a conditional diffusion model enhances the perceptual quality of reconstructions in neural image compression, their lack of inductive bias for image data restricts their ability to achieve state-of-the-art perceptual levels. To address this limitation, we adopt a non-isotropic diffusion model at the decoder side. This model imposes an inductive bias aimed at distinguishing between frequency contents, thereby facilitating the generation of high-quality images. Moreover, our framework is equipped with a novel entropy model that accurately models the probability distribution of latent representation by exploiting spatio-channel correlations in latent space, while accelerating the entropy decoding step. This channel-wise entropy model leverages both local and global spatial contexts within each channel chunk. The global spatial context is built upon the Transformer, which is specifically designed for image compression tasks. The designed Transformer employs a Laplacian-shaped positional encoding, the learnable parameters of which are adaptively adjusted for each channel cluster. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields better perceptual quality compared to cutting-edge generative-based codecs, and the proposed entropy model contributes to notable bitrate savings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhui Xu, Fuxun Yu, Zirui Xu, Nathan Inkawhich, Xiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hemorrhaging occurs in surgeries of all types, forcing surgeons to quickly adapt to the visual interference that results from blood rapidly filling the surgical field. Introducing automation into the crucial surgical task of hemostasis management would offload mental and physical tasks from the surgeon and surgical assistants while simultaneously increasing the efficiency and safety of the operation. The first step in automation of hemostasis management is detection of blood in the surgical field. To propel the development of blood detection algorithms in surgeries, we present HemoSet, the first blood segmentation dataset based on bleeding during a live animal robotic surgery. Our dataset features vessel hemorrhage scenarios where turbulent flow leads to abnormal pooling geometries in surgical fields. These pools are formed in conditions endemic to surgical procedures -- uneven heterogeneous tissue, under glossy lighting conditions and rapid tool movement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models and provide insight into the difficulties specific to blood detection. We intend for HemoSet to spur development of autonomous blood suction tools by providing a platform for training and refining blood segmentation models, addressing the precision needed for such robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasamin Medghalchi, Niloufar Zakariaei, Arman Rahmim, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) heavily relies on the abundance and accuracy of available training data. However, collecting and annotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive, particularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with their duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various scenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when dealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different devices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion (SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new informative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based on natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant GPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we introduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method tailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective fine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\% of parameters compared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset diversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process prompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across different images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making processes regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial role than intensity. In conclusion, our pipeline not only outperforms classifiers trained on the original dataset but also demonstrates superior performance when encountering unseen datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Gan, Ming Chang, Juan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to finely segment various organs. It requires grasping global information from both parts and the entire image for better segmenting, and clinically there are often certain requirements for segmentation efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made considerable achievements in MIS. However, they are difficult to fully collect global context information and their pooling layer may cause information loss. Capsule networks, which combine the benefits of CNNs while taking into account additional information such as relative location that CNNs do not, have lately demonstrated some advantages in MIS. Vision Transformer (ViT) employs transformers in visual tasks. Transformer based on attention mechanism has excellent global inductive modeling capabilities and is expected to capture longrange information. Moreover, there have been resent studies on making ViT more lightweight to minimize model complexity and increase efficiency. In this paper, we propose a U-shaped 3D encoder-decoder network named 3D-EffiViTCaps, which combines 3D capsule blocks with 3D EfficientViT blocks for MIS. Our encoder uses capsule blocks and EfficientViT blocks to jointly capture local and global semantic information more effectively and efficiently with less information loss, while the decoder employs CNN blocks and EfficientViT blocks to catch ffner details for segmentation. We conduct experiments on various datasets, including iSeg-2017, Hippocampus and Cardiac to verify the performance and efficiency of 3D-EffiViTCaps, which performs better than previous 3D CNN-based, 3D Capsule-based and 3D Transformer-based models. We further implement a series of ablation experiments on the main blocks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/HidNeuron/3D-EffiViTCaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Deng, Hua Chen, Haibo Hu, Zhiyong Xu, Tianling Lyu, Yan Xi, Yang Chen, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D CBCT) provides respiration-resolved images and can be used for image-guided radiation therapy. However, the ability to reveal respiratory motion comes at the cost of image artifacts. As raw projection data are sorted into multiple respiratory phases, there is a limited number of cone-beam projections available for image reconstruction. Consequently, the 4D CBCT images are covered by severe streak artifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, most algorithms employ ordinary network models, neglecting the intrinsic structural prior within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first explore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT images.Specifically, we find that streak artifacts exhibit a periodic rotational motion along with the patient's respiration. This unique motion pattern inspires us to distinguish the artifacts from the desired anatomical structures in the spatiotemporal domain. Thereafter, we propose a spatiotemporal neural network named RSTAR-Net with separable and circular convolutions for Rotational Streak Artifact Reduction. The specially designed model effectively encodes dynamic image features, facilitating the recovery of 4D CBCT images. Moreover, RSTAR-Net is also lightweight and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and RSTAR-Net shows superior performance to comparison methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern neural networks are often trained on massive datasets that are web scraped with minimal human inspection. As a result of this insecure curation pipeline, an adversary can poison or backdoor the resulting model by uploading malicious data to the internet and waiting for a victim to scrape and train on it. Existing approaches for creating poisons and backdoors start with randomly sampled clean data, called base samples, and then modify those samples to craft poisons. However, some base samples may be significantly more amenable to poisoning than others. As a result, we may be able to craft more potent poisons by carefully choosing the base samples. In this work, we use guided diffusion to synthesize base samples from scratch that lead to significantly more potent poisons and backdoors than previous state-of-the-art attacks. Our Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP) base samples can be combined with any downstream poisoning or backdoor attack to boost its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinke Dong, Haifeng Yuan, Hongkun Liu, Wei Jing, Fangzhen Li, Hongmin Liu, Bin Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of pedestrians, cyclists, and other surrounding vehicles (all called agents) is very important for autonomous driving. Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is crucial for evaluating organ morphology and function, yet depth adjustment can degrade image quality and field-of-view, presenting a depth-dependent dilemma. Traditional interpolation-based zoom-in techniques often sacrifice detail and introduce artifacts. Motivated by the potential of arbitrary-scale super-resolution to naturally address these inherent challenges, we present the Residual Dense Swin Transformer Network (RDSTN), designed to capture the non-local characteristics and long-range dependencies intrinsic to ultrasound images. It comprises a linear embedding module for feature enhancement, an encoder with shifted-window attention for modeling non-locality, and an MLP decoder for continuous detail reconstruction. This strategy streamlines balancing image quality and field-of-view, which offers superior textures over traditional methods. Experimentally, RDSTN outperforms existing approaches while requiring fewer parameters. In conclusion, RDSTN shows promising potential for ultrasound image enhancement by overcoming the limitations of conventional interpolation-based methods and achieving depth-independent imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaikang Zhao, Xi Chen, Wei Huang, Liuxin Ding, Xianglong Kong, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of an ensemble of deep learning models has been extensively explored to enhance defense against adversarial attacks. The diversity among sub-models increases the attack cost required to deceive the majority of the ensemble, thereby improving the adversarial robustness. While existing approaches mainly center on increasing diversity in feature representations or dispersion of first-order gradients with respect to input, the limited correlation between these diversity metrics and adversarial robustness constrains the performance of ensemble adversarial defense. In this work, we aim to enhance ensemble diversity by reducing attack transferability. We identify second-order gradients, which depict the loss curvature, as a key factor in adversarial robustness. Computing the Hessian matrix involved in second-order gradients is computationally expensive. To address this, we approximate the Hessian-vector product using differential approximation. Given that low curvature provides better robustness, our ensemble model was designed to consider the influence of curvature among different sub-models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gokul B. Nair, Michael Milford, Tobias Fischer</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras are increasingly popular in robotics due to their beneficial features, such as low latency, energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Nevertheless, their downstream task performance is greatly influenced by the optimization of bias parameters. These parameters, for instance, regulate the necessary change in light intensity to trigger an event, which in turn depends on factors such as the environment lighting and camera motion. This paper introduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias parameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly fast adaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between consecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even after changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the pixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of noise events across all pixels (slow adaptation). Our evaluation focuses on the visual place recognition task, where incoming query images are compared to a given reference database. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our algorithms' adaptive feedback control in real-time. To do so, we collected the QCR-Fast-and-Slow dataset that contains DAVIS346 event camera streams from 366 repeated traversals of a Scout Mini robot navigating through a 100 meter long indoor lab setting (totaling over 35km distance traveled) in varying brightness conditions with ground truth location information. Our proposed feedback controllers result in superior performance when compared to the standard bias settings and prior feedback control methods. Our findings also detail the impact of bias adjustments on task performance and feature ablation studies on the fast and slow adaptation mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Bando, Ramdas Pillai, Atsushi Kajita, Farhan Abdul Hakeem, Yves Quemener, Hua-an Tseng, Kiryl D. Piatkevich, Changyang Linghu, Xue Han, Edward S. Boyden</p>
<p>Abstract: In voltage imaging, where the membrane potentials of individual neurons are recorded at from hundreds to thousand frames per second using fluorescence microscopy, data processing presents a challenge. Even a fraction of a minute of recording with a limited image size yields gigabytes of video data consisting of tens of thousands of frames, which can be time-consuming to process. Moreover, millisecond-level short exposures lead to noisy video frames, obscuring neuron footprints especially in deep-brain samples where noisy signals are buried in background fluorescence. To address this challenge, we propose a fast neuron segmentation method able to detect multiple, potentially overlapping, spiking neurons from noisy video frames, and implement a data processing pipeline incorporating the proposed segmentation method along with GPU-accelerated motion correction. By testing on existing datasets as well as on new datasets we introduce, we show that our pipeline extracts neuron footprints that agree well with human annotation even from cluttered datasets, and demonstrate real-time processing of voltage imaging data on a single desktop computer for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunjiang Gu, Guanyu Song, Igor Gilitschenski, Marco Pavone, Boris Ivanovic</p>
<p>Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps have played an integral role in the development of modern autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks, albeit with high associated labeling and maintenance costs. As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Esfandiarpoor, Cristina Menghini, Stephen H. Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works often assume that Vision-Language Model (VLM) representations are based on visual attributes like shape. However, it is unclear to what extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize important textual features for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate the important features for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify the features that contribute to VLM representations. We find that spurious descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly, among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual attributes like habitat to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis reveals that different VLMs prioritize different attributes in their representations. Overall, we show that VLMs do not simply match images to scene descriptions and that non-visual or even spurious descriptions significantly influence their representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Wei, Zhongnian Li, Yong Zhou, Xinzheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed data is prevalent in real-world classification tasks and heavily relies on supervised information, which makes the annotation process exceptionally labor-intensive and time-consuming. Unfortunately, despite being a common approach to mitigate labeling costs, existing weakly supervised learning methods struggle to adequately preserve supervised information for tail samples, resulting in a decline in accuracy for the tail classes. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel weakly supervised labeling setting called Reduced Label. The proposed labeling setting not only avoids the decline of supervised information for the tail samples, but also decreases the labeling costs associated with long-tailed data. Additionally, we propose an straightforward and highly efficient unbiased framework with strong theoretical guarantees to learn from these Reduced Labels. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Mao, Haoli Bai, Lu Hou, Jiansheng Wei, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior study shows that pre-training techniques can boost the performance of visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g., locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme, facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information extraction, document classification, and document question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlin Zhou, Han Zhang, Zhaokun Zhou, Liutao Yu, Liwei Huang, Xiaopeng Fan, Li Yuan, Zhengyu Ma, Huihui Zhou, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) strategies play a crucial part in increasing the understanding and trustworthiness of neural networks. Nonetheless, these techniques could potentially generate misleading explanations. Blinding attacks can drastically alter a machine learning algorithm's prediction and explanation, providing misleading information by adding visually unnoticeable artifacts into the input, while maintaining the model's accuracy. It poses a serious challenge in ensuring the reliability of XAI methods. To ensure the reliability of XAI methods poses a real challenge, we leverage statistical analysis to highlight the changes in CNN weights within a CNN following blinding attacks. We introduce a method specifically designed to limit the effectiveness of such attacks during the evaluation phase, avoiding the need for extra training. The method we suggest defences against most modern explanation-aware adversarial attacks, achieving an approximate decrease of ~99\% in the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a ~91\% reduction in the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the original explanation and the defended (post-attack) explanation across three unique types of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Mena, Diego Arenas, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop classification is of critical importance due to its role in studying crop pattern changes, resource management, and carbon sequestration. When employing data-driven techniques for its prediction, utilizing various temporal data sources is necessary. Deep learning models have proven to be effective for this task by mapping time series data to high-level representation for prediction. However, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple input patterns. The literature offers limited guidance for Multi-View Learning (MVL) scenarios, as it has primarily focused on exploring fusion strategies with specific encoders and validating them in local regions. In contrast, we investigate the impact of simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and the encoder architecture evaluated on a global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoder architectures (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible MVL model configurations. The validation is on the CropHarvest dataset that provides optical, radar, and weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination, including encoder and fusion strategy, should be meticulously sought. To streamline this search process, we suggest initially identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a technical framework for researchers exploring crop classification or related tasks through a MVL approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kudaibergen Abutalip, Numan Saeed, Ikboljon Sobirov, Vincent Andrearczyk, Adrien Depeursinge, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep learning (DL) models in medical applications relies on predictive performance and other critical factors, such as conveying trustworthy predictive uncertainty. Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods provide potential solutions for evaluating prediction reliability and improving the model confidence calibration. Despite increasing interest in UE, challenges persist, such as the need for explicit methods to capture aleatoric uncertainty and align uncertainty estimates with real-life disagreements among domain experts. This paper proposes an Expert Disagreement-Guided Uncertainty Estimation (EDUE) for medical image segmentation. By leveraging variability in ground-truth annotations from multiple raters, we guide the model during training and incorporate random sampling-based strategies to enhance calibration confidence. Our method achieves 55% and 23% improvement in correlation on average with expert disagreements at the image and pixel levels, respectively, better calibration, and competitive segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep ensembles, requiring only a single forward pass.</p>

<p>Abstract: Seasonal forecasting is a crucial task when it comes to detecting the extreme heat and colds that occur due to climate change. Confidence in the predictions should be reliable since a small increase in the temperatures in a year has a big impact on the world. Calibration of the neural networks provides a way to ensure our confidence in the predictions. However, calibrating regression models is an under-researched topic, especially in forecasters. We calibrate a UNet++ based architecture, which was shown to outperform physics-based models in temperature anomalies. We show that with a slight trade-off between prediction error and calibration error, it is possible to get more reliable and sharper forecasts. We believe that calibration should be an important part of safety-critical machine learning applications such as weather forecasters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Feola, Lorenzo Tronchin, Valerio Guarrasi, Paolo Soda</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proved as a powerful framework for denoising applications in medical imaging. However, GAN-based denoising algorithms still suffer from limitations in capturing complex relationships within the images. In this regard, the loss function plays a crucial role in guiding the image generation process, encompassing how much a synthetic image differs from a real image. To grasp highly complex and non-linear textural relationships in the training process, this work presents a loss function that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the Gray-Level-Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Although the recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated superior performance in classification and detection tasks, we hypothesize that its information content can be valuable when integrated into GANs' training. To this end, we propose a differentiable implementation of the GLCM suited for gradient-based optimization. Our approach also introduces a self-attention layer that dynamically aggregates the multi-scale texture information extracted from the images. We validate our approach by carrying out extensive experiments in the context of low-dose CT denoising, a challenging application that aims to enhance the quality of noisy CT scans. We utilize three publicly available datasets, including one simulated and two real datasets. The results are promising as compared to other well-established loss functions, being also consistent across three different GAN architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingping Zheng, Ling Zheng, Yuanfan Guo, Ying Li, Songcen Xu, Jiankang Deng, Hang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artifact-free super-resolution (SR) aims to translate low-resolution images into their high-resolution counterparts with a strict integrity of the original content, eliminating any distortions or synthetic details. While traditional diffusion-based SR techniques have demonstrated remarkable abilities to enhance image detail, they are prone to artifact introduction during iterative procedures. Such artifacts, ranging from trivial noise to unauthentic textures, deviate from the true structure of the source image, thus challenging the integrity of the super-resolution process. In this work, we propose Self-Adaptive Reality-Guided Diffusion (SARGD), a training-free method that delves into the latent space to effectively identify and mitigate the propagation of artifacts. Our SARGD begins by using an artifact detector to identify implausible pixels, creating a binary mask that highlights artifacts. Following this, the Reality Guidance Refinement (RGR) process refines artifacts by integrating this mask with realistic latent representations, improving alignment with the original image. Nonetheless, initial realistic-latent representations from lower-quality images result in over-smoothing in the final output. To address this, we introduce a Self-Adaptive Guidance (SAG) mechanism. It dynamically computes a reality score, enhancing the sharpness of the realistic latent. These alternating mechanisms collectively achieve artifact-free super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, delivering detailed artifact-free high-resolution images while reducing sampling steps by 2X. We release our code at https://github.com/ProAirVerse/Self-Adaptive-Guidance-Diffusion.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Zhang, Jinhong Deng, Peidong Liu, Wen Li, Shiyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual detection of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its important application in various tasks. The existing methods for MAV detection assume that the training set and testing set have the same distribution. As a result, when deployed in new domains, the detectors would have a significant performance degradation due to domain discrepancy. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-domain MAV detection. The contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We propose a Multi-MAV-Multi-Domain (M3D) dataset consisting of both simulation and realistic images. Compared to other existing datasets, the proposed one is more comprehensive in the sense that it covers rich scenes, diverse MAV types, and various viewing angles. A new benchmark for cross-domain MAV detection is proposed based on the proposed dataset. 2) We propose a Noise Suppression Network (NSN) based on the framework of pseudo-labeling and a large-to-small training procedure. To reduce the challenging pseudo-label noises, two novel modules are designed in this network. The first is a prior-based curriculum learning module for allocating adaptive thresholds for pseudo labels with different difficulties. The second is a masked copy-paste augmentation module for pasting truly-labeled MAVs on unlabeled target images and thus decreasing pseudo-label noises. 3) Extensive experimental results verify the superior performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art ones. In particular, it achieves mAP of 46.9%(+5.8%), 50.5%(+3.7%), and 61.5%(+11.3%) on the tasks of simulation-to-real adaptation, cross-scene adaptation, and cross-camera adaptation, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks.
  This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on perceptual quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising opportunities for clinical decision support and enhancing diagnostic workflows. Previous studies already demonstrated AI's potential for automated Gleason grading, but lack state-of-the-art methodology and model reusability. To address this issue, we propose DeepGleason: an open-source deep neural network based image classification system for automated Gleason grading using whole-slide histopathology images from prostate tissue sections. Implemented with the standardized AUCMEDI framework, our tool employs a tile-wise classification approach utilizing fine-tuned image preprocessing techniques in combination with a ConvNeXt architecture which was compared to various state-of-the-art architectures. The neural network model was trained and validated on an in-house dataset of 34,264 annotated tiles from 369 prostate carcinoma slides. We demonstrated that DeepGleason is capable of highly accurate and reliable Gleason grading with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.806, AUC of 0.991, and Accuracy of 0.974. The internal architecture comparison revealed that the ConvNeXt model was superior performance-wise on our dataset to established and other modern architectures like transformers. Furthermore, we were able to outperform the current state-of-the-art in tile-wise fine-classification with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.98 for benign vs malignant detection as well as of 0.91 and 0.75 for Gleason 3 vs Gleason 4 & 5 classification, respectively. Our tool contributes to the wider adoption of AI-based Gleason grading within the research community and paves the way for broader clinical application of deep learning models in digital pathology.

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn user-specific preferences (e.g., "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off location") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

<p>Abstract: Prostate cancer is a dominant health concern calling for advanced diagnostic tools. Utilizing digital pathology and artificial intelligence, this study explores the potential of 11 deep neural network architectures for automated Gleason grading in prostate carcinoma focusing on comparing traditional and recent architectures. A standardized image classification pipeline, based on the AUCMEDI framework, facilitated robust evaluation using an in-house dataset consisting of 34,264 annotated tissue tiles. The results indicated varying sensitivity across architectures, with ConvNeXt demonstrating the strongest performance. Notably, newer architectures achieved superior performance, even though with challenges in differentiating closely related Gleason grades. The ConvNeXt model was capable of learning a balance between complexity and generalizability. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for enhanced Gleason grading systems, potentially improving diagnostic efficiency for prostate cancer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasushi Esaki, Satoshi Koide, Takuro Kutsuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain incremental learning (DIL) has been discussed in previous studies on deep neural network models for classification. In DIL, we assume that samples on new domains are observed over time. The models must classify inputs on all domains. In practice, however, we may encounter a situation where we need to perform DIL under the constraint that the samples on the new domain are observed only infrequently. Therefore, in this study, we consider the extreme case where we have only one sample from the new domain, which we call one-shot DIL. We first empirically show that existing DIL methods do not work well in one-shot DIL. We have analyzed the reason for this failure through various investigations. According to our analysis, we clarify that the difficulty of one-shot DIL is caused by the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Therefore, we propose a technique regarding these statistics and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through experiments on open datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophie Starck, Vasiliki Sideri-Lampretsa, Bernhard Kainz, Martin Menten, Tamara Mueller, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population analysis. Conditional atlases target a particular sub-population defined via certain conditions (e.g. demographics or pathologies) and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences - such as morphological changes correlated with age. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative models, which can suffer from training instabilities and hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we use latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. By generating a deformation field and registering the conditional atlas to a neighbourhood of images, we ensure structural plausibility and avoid hallucinations, which can occur during direct image synthesis. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods in experiments using 5000 brain as well as whole-body MR images from UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgii Mikriukov, Gesina Schwalbe, Franz Motzkus, Korinna Bade</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks (AAs) pose a significant threat to the reliability and robustness of deep neural networks. While the impact of these attacks on model predictions has been extensively studied, their effect on the learned representations and concepts within these models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of AAs on the concepts learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Through an extensive set of experiments across various network architectures and targeted AA techniques, we unveil several key findings. First, AAs induce substantial alterations in the concept composition within the feature space, introducing new concepts or modifying existing ones. Second, the adversarial perturbation itself can be linearly decomposed into a set of latent vector components, with a subset of these being responsible for the attack's success. Notably, we discover that these components are target-specific, i.e., are similar for a given target class throughout different AA techniques and starting classes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the nature of AAs and their impact on learned representations, paving the way for the development of more robust and interpretable deep learning models, as well as effective defenses against adversarial threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicong Pan, Liren Jin, Xuying Huang, Cyrill Stachniss, Marija Popovi\'c, Maren Bennewitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Object reconstruction is relevant for many autonomous robotic tasks that require interaction with the environment. A key challenge in such scenarios is planning view configurations to collect informative measurements for reconstructing an initially unknown object. One-shot view planning enables efficient data collection by predicting view configurations and planning the globally shortest path connecting all views at once. However, geometric priors about the object are required to conduct one-shot view planning. In this work, we propose a novel one-shot view planning approach that utilizes the powerful 3D generation capabilities of diffusion models as priors. By incorporating such geometric priors into our pipeline, we achieve effective one-shot view planning starting with only a single RGB image of the object to be reconstructed. Our planning experiments in simulation and real-world setups indicate that our approach balances well between object reconstruction quality and movement cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghuan Liu, Zixuan Chen, Xuxin Cheng, Yandong Ji, Ruihan Yang, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of mobile manipulation using legged robots equipped with an arm, namely legged loco-manipulation. The robot legs, while usually utilized for mobility, offer an opportunity to amplify the manipulation capabilities by conducting whole-body control. That is, the robot can control the legs and the arm at the same time to extend its workspace. We propose a framework that can conduct the whole-body control autonomously with visual observations. Our approach, namely \ourFull~(\our), is composed of a low-level policy using all degrees of freedom to track the end-effector manipulator position and a high-level policy proposing the end-effector position based on visual inputs. We train both levels of policies in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer for real robot deployment. We perform extensive experiments and show significant improvements over baselines in picking up diverse objects in different configurations (heights, locations, orientations) and environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Qiu, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning has become the state-of-the-art for computer-assisted diagnosis, interpretability of the automatic decisions is crucial for clinical deployment. While various methods were proposed in this domain, visual attention maps of clinicians during radiological screening offer a unique asset to provide important insights and can potentially enhance the quality of computer-assisted diagnosis. With this paper, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework for joint disease diagnosis and prediction of corresponding visual saliency maps for chest X-ray scans. Specifically, we designed a novel dual-encoder multi-task UNet, which leverages both a DenseNet201 backbone and a Residual and Squeeze-and-Excitation block-based encoder to extract diverse features for saliency map prediction, and a multi-scale feature-fusion classifier to perform disease classification. To tackle the issue of asynchronous training schedules of individual tasks in multi-task learning, we proposed a multi-stage cooperative learning strategy, with contrastive learning for feature encoder pretraining to boost performance. Experiments show that our proposed method outperformed existing techniques for chest X-ray diagnosis and the quality of visual saliency map prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yair Ben Sahel, Yonina C. Eldar</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of fluorescent molecules to create long sequences of low-density, diffraction-limited images enables highly-precise molecule localization. However, this methodology requires lengthy imaging times, which limits the ability to view dynamic interactions of live cells on short time scales. Many techniques have been developed to reduce the number of frames needed for localization, from classic iterative optimization to deep neural networks. Particularly, deep algorithm unrolling utilizes both the structure of iterative sparse recovery algorithms and the performance gains of supervised deep learning. However, the robustness of this approach is highly dependant on having sufficient training data. In this paper we introduce deep unrolled self-supervised learning, which alleviates the need for such data by training a sequence-specific, model-based autoencoder that learns only from given measurements. Our proposed method exceeds the performance of its supervised counterparts, thus allowing for robust, dynamic imaging well below the diffraction limit without any labeled training samples. Furthermore, the suggested model-based autoencoder scheme can be utilized to enhance generalization in any sparse recovery framework, without the need for external training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time object tracking necessitates a delicate balance between speed and accuracy, a challenge exacerbated by the computational demands of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Triggered Detection (CTD), an innovative approach that strategically bypasses object detection for frames closely resembling intermediate states, leveraging tracker confidence scores. CTD not only enhances tracking speed but also preserves accuracy, surpassing existing tracking algorithms. Through extensive evaluation across various tracker confidence thresholds, we identify an optimal trade-off between tracking speed and accuracy, providing crucial insights for parameter fine-tuning and enhancing CTD's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our experiments across diverse detection models underscore the robustness and versatility of the CTD framework, demonstrating its potential to enable real-time tracking in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Zhu, Xinjie Yao, Yu Wang, Binyuan Hui, Dawei Du, Qinghua Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view subspace clustering aims to discover the inherent structure of data by fusing multiple views of complementary information. Most existing methods first extract multiple types of handcrafted features and then learn a joint affinity matrix for clustering. The disadvantage of this approach lies in two aspects: 1) multi-view relations are not embedded into feature learning, and 2) the end-to-end learning manner of deep learning is not suitable for multi-view clustering. Even when deep features have been extracted, it is a nontrivial problem to choose a proper backbone for clustering on different datasets. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-view Deep Subspace Clustering Networks (MvDSCN), which learns a multi-view self-representation matrix in an end-to-end manner. The MvDSCN consists of two sub-networks, \ie, a diversity network (Dnet) and a universality network (Unet). A latent space is built using deep convolutional autoencoders, and a self-representation matrix is learned in the latent space using a fully connected layer. Dnet learns view-specific self-representation matrices, whereas Unet learns a common self-representation matrix for all views. To exploit the complementarity of multi-view representations, the Hilbert--Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced as a diversity regularizer that captures the nonlinear, high-order inter-view relations. Because different views share the same label space, the self-representation matrices of each view are aligned to the common one by universality regularization. The MvDSCN also unifies multiple backbones to boost clustering performance and avoid the need for model selection. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the MvDSCN.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05453">Improving White-box Robustness of Pre-processing Defenses via Joint Adversarial Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Zhou, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao, Bo Han, Jun Yu, Xiaoyu Wang, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. A range of adversarial defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate the interference of adversarial noise, among which the input pre-processing methods are scalable and show great potential to safeguard DNNs. However, pre-processing methods may suffer from the robustness degradation effect, in which the defense reduces rather than improving the adversarial robustness of a target model in a white-box setting. A potential cause of this negative effect is that adversarial training examples are static and independent to the pre-processing model. To solve this problem, we investigate the influence of full adversarial examples which are crafted against the full model, and find they indeed have a positive impact on the robustness of defenses. Furthermore, we find that simply changing the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not completely alleviate the robustness degradation effect. This is due to the adversarial risk of the pre-processed model being neglected, which is another cause of the robustness degradation effect. Motivated by above analyses, we propose a method called Joint Adversarial Training based Pre-processing (JATP) defense. Specifically, we formulate a feature similarity based adversarial risk for the pre-processing model by using full adversarial examples found in a feature space. Unlike standard adversarial training, we only update the pre-processing model, which prompts us to introduce a pixel-wise loss to improve its cross-model transferability. We then conduct a joint adversarial training on the pre-processing model to minimize this overall risk. Empirical results show that our method could effectively mitigate the robustness degradation effect across different target models in comparison to previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Wang, Xuequan Lu, Dasith de Silva Edirimuni, Xiao Liu, Antonio Robles-Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: Normal estimation on 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D vision and graphics. Current methods often show limited accuracy in predicting normals at sharp features (e.g., edges and corners) and less robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel normal estimation method for point clouds. It consists of two phases: (a) feature encoding which learns representations of local patches, and (b) normal estimation that takes the learned representation as input and regresses the normal vector. We are motivated that local patches on isotropic and anisotropic surfaces have similar or distinct normals, and that separable features or representations can be learned to facilitate normal estimation. To realise this, we first construct triplets of local patches on 3D point cloud data, and design a triplet network with a triplet loss for feature encoding. We then design a simple network with several MLPs and a loss function to regress the normal vector. Despite having a smaller network size compared to most other methods, experimental results show that our method preserves sharp features and achieves better normal estimation results on CAD-like shapes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with high computation costs, e.g., BigGAN and StyleGAN2, have achieved remarkable results in synthesizing high-resolution images from random noise. Reducing the computation cost of GANs while keeping generating photo-realistic images is a challenging field. In this work, we propose a novel yet simple {\bf D}iscriminator {\bf G}uided {\bf L}earning approach for compressing vanilla {\bf GAN}, dubbed {\bf DGL-GAN}. Motivated by the phenomenon that the teacher discriminator may contain some meaningful information about both real images and fake images, we merely transfer the knowledge from the teacher discriminator via the adversarial interaction between the teacher discriminator and the student generator. We apply DGL-GAN to compress the two most representative large-scale vanilla GANs, i.e., StyleGAN2 and BigGAN. Experiments show that DGL-GAN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on both StyleGAN2 and BigGAN. Moreover, DGL-GAN is also effective in boosting the performance of original uncompressed GANs. Original uncompressed StyleGAN2 boosted with DGL-GAN achieves FID 2.65 on FFHQ, which achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangmeng Li, Wenyi Mo, Wenwen Qiang, Bing Su, Changwen Zheng, Hui Xiong, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models are pre-trained by aligning image-text pairs in a common space to deal with open-set visual concepts. To boost the transferability of the pre-trained models, recent works adopt fixed or learnable prompts, i.e., classification weights are synthesized from natural language describing task-relevant categories, to reduce the gap between tasks in the training and test phases. However, how and what prompts can improve inference performance remains unclear. In this paper, we explicitly clarify the importance of including semantic information in prompts, while existing prompting methods generate prompts without exploring the semantic information of textual labels. Manually constructing prompts with rich semantics requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To cope with this issue, we propose a semantic-aware prompt learning method, namely CPKP, which retrieves an ontological knowledge graph by treating the textual label as a query to extract task-relevant semantic information. CPKP further introduces a double-tier confounder-pruning procedure to refine the derived semantic information. The graph-tier confounders are gradually identified and phased out, inspired by the principle of Granger causality. The feature-tier confounders are demolished by following the maximum entropy principle in information theory. Empirically, the evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CPKP, e.g., with two shots, CPKP outperforms the manual-prompt method by 4.64% and the learnable-prompt method by 1.09% on average, and the superiority of CPKP in domain generalization compared to benchmark approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanshui Gan, Hongbin Xu, Yi Huang, Shifeng Chen, Naoto Yokoya</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural radiance fields have made a remarkable breakthrough in the novel view synthesis task at the 3D static scene. However, for the 4D circumstance (e.g., dynamic scene), the performance of the existing method is still limited by the capacity of the neural network, typically in a multilayer perceptron network (MLP). In this paper, we utilize 3D Voxel to model the 4D neural radiance field, short as V4D, where the 3D voxel has two formats. The first one is to regularly model the 3D space and then use the sampled local 3D feature with the time index to model the density field and the texture field by a tiny MLP. The second one is in look-up tables (LUTs) format that is for the pixel-level refinement, where the pseudo-surface produced by the volume rendering is utilized as the guidance information to learn a 2D pixel-level refinement mapping. The proposed LUTs-based refinement module achieves the performance gain with little computational cost and could serve as the plug-and-play module in the novel view synthesis task. Moreover, we propose a more effective conditional positional encoding toward the 4D data that achieves performance gain with negligible computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a low computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, vision transformers have become very popular. However, deploying them in many applications is computationally expensive partly due to the Softmax layer in the attention block. We introduce a simple but effective, Softmax-free attention block, SimA, which normalizes query and key matrices with simple $\ell_1$-norm instead of using Softmax layer. Then, the attention block in SimA is a simple multiplication of three matrices, so SimA can dynamically change the ordering of the computation at the test time to achieve linear computation on the number of tokens or the number of channels. We empirically show that SimA applied to three SOTA variations of transformers, DeiT, XCiT, and CvT, results in on-par accuracy compared to the SOTA models, without any need for Softmax layer. Interestingly, changing SimA from multi-head to single-head has only a small effect on the accuracy, which simplifies the attention block further.

<p>Abstract: Longitudinal imaging is able to capture both static anatomical structures and dynamic changes in disease progression towards earlier and better patient-specific pathology management. However, conventional approaches for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) rarely take advantage of longitudinal information to improve DR analysis. In this work, we investigate the benefit of exploiting self-supervised learning with a longitudinal nature for DR diagnosis purposes. We compare different longitudinal self-supervised learning (LSSL) methods to model the disease progression from longitudinal retinal color fundus photographs (CFP) to detect early DR severity changes using a pair of consecutive exams. The experiments were conducted on a longitudinal DR screening dataset with or without those trained encoders (LSSL) acting as a longitudinal pretext task. Results achieve an AUC of 0.875 for the baseline (model trained from scratch) and an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.9593-0.9655 DeLong test) with a p-value < 2.2e-16 on early fusion using a simple ResNet alike architecture with frozen LSSL weights, suggesting that the LSSL latent space enables to encode the dynamic of DR progression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxiang Li, Meng Cao, Xuxin Cheng, Zhihong Zhu, Yaowei Li, Yuexian Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Video grounding aims to locate a moment of interest matching the given query sentence from an untrimmed video. Previous works ignore the {sparsity dilemma} in video annotations, which fails to provide the context information between potential events and query sentences in the dataset. In this paper, we contend that exploiting easily available captions which describe general actions, i.e., auxiliary captions defined in our paper, will significantly boost the performance. To this end, we propose an Auxiliary Caption Network (ACNet) for video grounding. Specifically, we first introduce dense video captioning to generate dense captions and then obtain auxiliary captions by Non-Auxiliary Caption Suppression (NACS). To capture the potential information in auxiliary captions, we propose Caption Guided Attention (CGA) project the semantic relations between auxiliary captions and query sentences into temporal space and fuse them into visual representations. Considering the gap between auxiliary captions and ground truth, we propose Asymmetric Cross-modal Contrastive Learning (ACCL) for constructing more negative pairs to maximize cross-modal mutual information. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., ActivityNet Captions, TACoS and ActivityNet-CG) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wang, Mengyuan Liu, Hong Liu, Wenhao Li, Miaoju Ban, Tuanyu Guo, Yidi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Occluded person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging problem due to the destruction of occluders. Most existing methods focus on visible human body parts through some prior information. However, when complementary occlusions occur, features in occluded regions can interfere with matching, which affects performance severely. In this paper, different from most previous works that discard the occluded region, we propose a Feature Completion Transformer (FCFormer) to implicitly complement the semantic information of occluded parts in the feature space. Specifically, Occlusion Instance Augmentation (OIA) is proposed to simulates real and diverse occlusion situations on the holistic image. These augmented images not only enrich the amount of occlusion samples in the training set, but also form pairs with the holistic images. Subsequently, a dual-stream architecture with a shared encoder is proposed to learn paired discriminative features from pairs of inputs. Without additional semantic information, an occluded-holistic feature sample-label pair can be automatically created. Then, Feature Completion Decoder (FCD) is designed to complement the features of occluded regions by using learnable tokens to aggregate possible information from self-generated occluded features. Finally, we propose the Cross Hard Triplet (CHT) loss to further bridge the gap between complementing features and extracting features under the same ID. In addition, Feature Completion Consistency (FC$^2$) loss is introduced to help the generated completion feature distribution to be closer to the real holistic feature distribution. Extensive experiments over five challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed FCFormer achieves superior performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on occluded datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoheng Lan, Jindong Gu, Philip Torr, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: When a small number of poisoned samples are injected into the training dataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibit malicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats to real-world applications. While they have been intensively studied in classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of all victim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied to real-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation models, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injection strategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy which maintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from the victim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-world applicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increase attack performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhong Chen, Yuyuan Liu, Hu Wang, Fengbei Liu, Chong Wang, Helen Frazer, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a challenging task that involves accurately segmenting sounding objects based on audio-visual cues. The effectiveness of audio-visual learning critically depends on achieving accurate cross-modal alignment between sound and visual objects. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) a challenging dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class annotated images associated with audio files, and 2) a model that can establish strong links between audio information and its corresponding visual object. However, these requirements are only partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we propose a new cost-effective strategy to build challenging and relatively unbiased high-quality audio-visual segmentation benchmarks. We also propose a new informative sample mining method for audio-visual supervised contrastive learning to leverage discriminative contrastive samples to enforce cross-modal understanding. We show empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark. Furthermore, experiments conducted on existing AVS datasets and on our new benchmark show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaozhe Hao, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the issue of generalized category discovery (GCD). GCD considers the open-world problem of automatically clustering a partially labelled dataset, in which the unlabelled data may contain instances from both novel categories and labelled classes. In this paper, we address the GCD problem with an unknown category number for the unlabelled data. We propose a framework, named CiPR, to bootstrap the representation by exploiting Cross-instance Positive Relations in the partially labelled data for contrastive learning, which have been neglected in existing methods. To obtain reliable cross-instance relations to facilitate representation learning, we introduce a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, named selective neighbor clustering (SNC), which can produce a clustering hierarchy directly from the connected components of a graph constructed from selective neighbors. We further present a method to estimate the unknown class number using SNC with a joint reference score that considers clustering indexes of both labelled and unlabelled data, and extend SNC to allow label assignment for the unlabelled instances with a given class number. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on public generic image recognition datasets and challenging fine-grained datasets, and establish a new state-of-the-art. Code: https://github.com/haoosz/CiPR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghua Zhang, Li Liu, Kai Gao, Dewen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Pill Recognition (APR) systems are crucial for enhancing hospital efficiency, assisting visually impaired individuals, and preventing cross-infection. However, most existing deep learning-based pill recognition systems can only perform classification on classes with sufficient training data. In practice, the high cost of data annotation and the continuous increase in new pill classes necessitate the development of a few-shot class-incremental pill recognition system. This paper introduces the first few-shot class-incremental pill recognition framework, named Discriminative and Bidirectional Compatible Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (DBC-FSCIL). It encompasses forward-compatible and backward-compatible learning components. In forward-compatible learning, we propose an innovative virtual class synthesis strategy and a Center-Triplet (CT) loss to enhance discriminative feature learning. These virtual classes serve as placeholders in the feature space for future class updates, providing diverse semantic knowledge for model training. For backward-compatible learning, we develop a strategy to synthesize reliable pseudo-features of old classes using uncertainty quantification, facilitating Data Replay (DR) and Knowledge Distillation (KD). This approach allows for the flexible synthesis of features and effectively reduces additional storage requirements for samples and models. Additionally, we construct a new pill image dataset for FSCIL and assess various mainstream FSCIL methods, establishing new benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses existing State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhang-jinghua/DBC-FSCIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Zhang, Dongsheng An, Tianjun Xiao, Tong He, Qingming Tang, Ying Nian Wu, Joseph Tighe, Yifan Xing, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep metric learning for visual recognition, the calibration of distance thresholds is crucial for achieving desired model performance in the true positive rates (TPR) or true negative rates (TNR). However, calibrating this threshold presents challenges in open-world scenarios, where the test classes can be entirely disjoint from those encountered during training. We define the problem of finding distance thresholds for a trained embedding model to achieve target performance metrics over unseen open-world test classes as open-world threshold calibration. Existing posthoc threshold calibration methods, reliant on inductive inference and requiring a calibration dataset with a similar distance distribution as the test data, often prove ineffective in open-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce OpenGCN, a Graph Neural Network-based transductive threshold calibration method with enhanced adaptability and robustness. OpenGCN learns to predict pairwise connectivity for the unlabeled test instances embedded in a graph to determine its TPR and TNR at various distance thresholds, allowing for transductive inference of the distance thresholds which also incorporates test-time information. Extensive experiments across open-world visual recognition benchmarks validate OpenGCN's superiority over existing posthoc calibration methods for open-world threshold calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Mao, Chenming Wu, Zhelun Shen, Yifan Wang, Dayan Wu, Liangjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method, namely NeuS-PIR, for recovering relightable neural surfaces using pre-integrated rendering from multi-view images or video. Unlike methods based on NeRF and discrete meshes, our method utilizes implicit neural surface representation to reconstruct high-quality geometry, which facilitates the factorization of the radiance field into two components: a spatially varying material field and an all-frequency lighting representation. This factorization, jointly optimized using an adapted differentiable pre-integrated rendering framework with material encoding regularization, in turn addresses the ambiguity of geometry reconstruction and leads to better disentanglement and refinement of each scene property. Additionally, we introduced a method to distil indirect illumination fields from the learned representations, further recovering the complex illumination effect like inter-reflection. Consequently, our method enables advanced applications such as relighting, which can be seamlessly integrated with modern graphics engines. Qualitative and quantitative experiments have shown that NeuS-PIR outperforms existing methods across various tasks on both synthetic and real datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzhe Wang, Juho Kannala, Daniel Barath</p>
<p>Abstract: Matching 2D keypoints in an image to a sparse 3D point cloud of the scene without requiring visual descriptors has garnered increased interest due to its low memory requirements, inherent privacy preservation, and reduced need for expensive 3D model maintenance compared to visual descriptor-based methods. However, existing algorithms often compromise on performance, resulting in a significant deterioration compared to their descriptor-based counterparts. In this paper, we introduce DGC-GNN, a novel algorithm that employs a global-to-local Graph Neural Network (GNN) that progressively exploits geometric and color cues to represent keypoints, thereby improving matching accuracy. Our procedure encodes both Euclidean and angular relations at a coarse level, forming the geometric embedding to guide the point matching. We evaluate DGC-GNN on both indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating that it not only doubles the accuracy of the state-of-the-art visual descriptor-free algorithm but also substantially narrows the performance gap between descriptor-based and descriptor-free methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhong Fu, Liangliang Yao, Haobo Zuo, Guangze Zheng, Jia Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) has demonstrated significant promise for real-time nighttime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) DA still lacks the potential object with accurate pixel-level location and boundary to generate the high-quality target domain training sample. This key issue constrains the transfer learning of the real-time daytime SOTA trackers for challenging nighttime UAV tracking. Recently, the notable Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved a remarkable zero-shot generalization ability to discover abundant potential objects due to its huge data-driven training approach. To solve the aforementioned issue, this work proposes a novel SAM-powered DA framework for real-time nighttime UAV tracking, i.e., SAM-DA. Specifically, an innovative SAM-powered target domain training sample swelling is designed to determine enormous high-quality target domain training samples from every single raw nighttime image. This novel one-to-many generation significantly expands the high-quality target domain training sample for DA. Comprehensive experiments on extensive nighttime UAV videos prove the robustness and domain adaptability of SAM-DA for nighttime UAV tracking. Especially, compared to the SOTA DA, SAM-DA can achieve better performance with fewer raw nighttime images, i.e., the fewer-better training. This economized training approach facilitates the quick validation and deployment of algorithms for UAVs. The code is available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/SAM-DA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comparing different age estimation methods poses a challenge due to the unreliability of published results stemming from inconsistencies in the benchmarking process. Previous studies have reported continuous performance improvements over the past decade using specialized methods; however, our findings challenge these claims. This paper identifies two trivial, yet persistent issues with the currently used evaluation protocol and describes how to resolve them. We offer an extensive comparative analysis for state-of-the-art facial age estimation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the performance differences between the methods are negligible compared to the effect of other factors, such as facial alignment, facial coverage, image resolution, model architecture, or the amount of data used for pretraining. We use the gained insights to propose using FaRL as the backbone model and demonstrate its effectiveness on all public datasets. We make the source code and exact data splits public on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Qin, Yingke Chen, Dezhong Peng, Xi Peng, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Peng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) is a compelling topic in the cross-modal community, which aims to retrieve the target person based on a textual query. Although numerous TIReID methods have been proposed and achieved promising performance, they implicitly assume the training image-text pairs are correctly aligned, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. In practice, the image-text pairs inevitably exist under-correlated or even false-correlated, a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC), due to the low quality of the images and annotation errors. To address this problem, we propose a novel Robust Dual Embedding method (RDE) that can learn robust visual-semantic associations even with NC. Specifically, RDE consists of two main components: 1) A Confident Consensus Division (CCD) module that leverages the dual-grained decisions of dual embedding modules to obtain a consensus set of clean training data, which enables the model to learn correct and reliable visual-semantic associations. 2) A Triplet Alignment Loss (TAL) relaxes the conventional Triplet Ranking loss with the hardest negative samples to a log-exponential upper bound over all negative ones, thus preventing the model collapse under NC and can also focus on hard-negative samples for promising performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, namely CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID, to evaluate the performance and robustness of our RDE. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results both with and without synthetic noisy correspondences on all three datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/QinYang79/RDE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunyu Wang, Xuanran He, Wenxuan Wang, Xiaosen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples mislead deep neural networks with imperceptible perturbations and have brought significant threats to deep learning. An important aspect is their transferability, which refers to their ability to deceive other models, thus enabling attacks in the black-box setting. Though various methods have been proposed to boost transferability, the performance still falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work, we observe that existing input transformation based attacks, one of the mainstream transfer-based attacks, result in different attention heatmaps on various models, which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the intrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the original image. Based on this finding, we propose a novel input transformation based attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR). Specifically, BSR splits the input image into several blocks, then randomly shuffles and rotates these blocks to construct a set of new images for gradient calculation. Empirical evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that BSR could achieve significantly better transferability than the existing input transformation based methods under single-model and ensemble-model settings. Combining BSR with the current input transformation method can further improve the transferability, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce InsertNeRF, a method for INStilling gEneRalizabiliTy into NeRF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heitor Rapela Medeiros, Fidel A. Guerrero Pena, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Thomas Dubail, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: A powerful way to adapt a visual recognition model to a new domain is through image translation. However, common image translation approaches only focus on generating data from the same distribution as the target domain. Given a cross-modal application, such as pedestrian detection from aerial images, with a considerable shift in data distribution between infrared (IR) to visible (RGB) images, a translation focused on generation might lead to poor performance as the loss focuses on irrelevant details for the task. In this paper, we propose HalluciDet, an IR-RGB image translation model for object detection. Instead of focusing on reconstructing the original image on the IR modality, it seeks to reduce the detection loss of an RGB detector, and therefore avoids the need to access RGB data. This model produces a new image representation that enhances objects of interest in the scene and greatly improves detection performance. We empirically compare our approach against state-of-the-art methods for image translation and for fine-tuning on IR, and show that our HalluciDet improves detection accuracy in most cases by exploiting the privileged information encoded in a pre-trained RGB detector.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled 3D generation from a single image. However, current methods often produce suboptimal results for novel views, with blurred textures and deviations from the reference image, limiting their practical applications. In this paper, we introduce HiFi-123, a method designed for high-fidelity and multi-view consistent 3D generation.

Second, capitalizing on the RGNV, we present a novel Reference-Guided State Distillation (RGSD) loss. When incorporated into the optimization-based image-to-3D pipeline, our method significantly improves 3D generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Video results are available on the project page.</p>

We investigate the ODE solvers used to solve the Probability Flow ODE and the impact they have on the the creation of face morphs. Additionally, we employ an alternative method for encoding images into the latent space of the Diffusion model by solving the Probability Flow ODE as time runs forwards. Our experiments show that we can reduce the NFE by upwards of 85% in the encoding process while experiencing only 1.6% reduction in Mated Morph Presentation Match Rate (MMPMR). Likewise, we showed we could cut NFE, in the sampling process, in half with only a maximal reduction of 0.23% in MMPMR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vision and language generative models have been overgrown in recent years. For video generation, various open-sourced models and public-available services have been developed to generate high-quality videos. However, these methods often use a few metrics, e.g., FVD or IS, to evaluate the performance. We argue that it is hard to judge the large conditional generative models from the simple metrics since these models are often trained on very large datasets with multi-aspect abilities. Thus, we propose a novel framework and pipeline for exhaustively evaluating the performance of the generated videos. Our approach involves generating a diverse and comprehensive list of 700 prompts for text-to-video generation, which is based on an analysis of real-world user data and generated with the assistance of a large language model. Then, we evaluate the state-of-the-art video generative models on our carefully designed benchmark, in terms of visual qualities, content qualities, motion qualities, and text-video alignment with 17 well-selected objective metrics. To obtain the final leaderboard of the models, we further fit a series of coefficients to align the objective metrics to the users' opinions. Based on the proposed human alignment method, our final score shows a higher correlation than simply averaging the metrics, showing the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized the generation of realistic and complex images. However, these models also introduce potential safety hazards, such as producing harmful content and infringing data copyrights. Despite the development of safety-driven unlearning techniques to counteract these challenges, doubts about their efficacy persist. To tackle this issue, we introduce an evaluation framework that leverages adversarial prompts to discern the trustworthiness of these safety-driven DMs after they have undergone the process of unlearning harmful concepts. Specifically, we investigated the adversarial robustness of DMs, assessed by adversarial prompts, when eliminating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects. We develop an effective and efficient adversarial prompt generation approach for DMs, termed UnlearnDiffAtk. This method capitalizes on the intrinsic classification abilities of DMs to simplify the creation of adversarial prompts, thereby eliminating the need for auxiliary classification or diffusion models.Through extensive benchmarking, we evaluate the robustness of five widely-used safety-driven unlearned DMs (i.e., DMs after unlearning undesirable concepts, styles, or objects) across a variety of tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency merits of UnlearnDiffAtk over the state-of-the-art adversarial prompt generation method and reveal the lack of robustness of current safety-driven unlearning techniques when applied to DMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Diffusion-MU-Attack.

In our evaluation on HallusionBench, we benchmarked 15 different models, highlighting a 31.42% question-pair accuracy achieved by the state-of-the-art GPT-4V. Notably, all other evaluated models achieve accuracy below 16%. Moreover, our analysis not only highlights the observed failure modes, including language hallucination and visual illusion, but also deepens an understanding of these pitfalls. Our comprehensive case studies within HallusionBench shed light on the challenges of hallucination and illusion in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we suggest potential pathways for their future improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Kapon, Guy Tevet, Daniel Cohen-Or, Amit H. Bermano</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Multi-view Ancestral Sampling (MAS), a method for 3D motion generation, using 2D diffusion models that were trained on motions obtained from in-the-wild videos. As such, MAS opens opportunities to exciting and diverse fields of motion previously under-explored as 3D data is scarce and hard to collect. MAS works by simultaneously denoising multiple 2D motion sequences representing different views of the same 3D motion. It ensures consistency across all views at each diffusion step by combining the individual generations into a unified 3D sequence, and projecting it back to the original views. We demonstrate MAS on 2D pose data acquired from videos depicting professional basketball maneuvers, rhythmic gymnastic performances featuring a ball apparatus, and horse races. In each of these domains, 3D motion capture is arduous, and yet, MAS generates diverse and realistic 3D sequences. Unlike the Score Distillation approach, which optimizes each sample by repeatedly applying small fixes, our method uses a sampling process that was constructed for the diffusion framework. As we demonstrate, MAS avoids common issues such as out-of-domain sampling and mode-collapse. https://guytevet.github.io/mas-page/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Liu, Yao Feng, Yuliang Xiu, Weiyang Liu, Liam Paull, Michael J. Black, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: The creation of photorealistic virtual worlds requires the accurate modeling of 3D surface geometry for a wide range of objects. For this, meshes are appealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications: differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for watertight meshes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Shi, Yanyuan Qiao, Qi Wu, Lingqiao Liu, Feras Dayoub</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective object detection in mobile robots is challenged by deployment in diverse and unfamiliar environments. Online Source-Free Domain Adaptation (O-SFDA) offers model adaptation using a stream of unlabeled data from a target domain in online manner. However, not all captured frames contain information that is beneficial for adaptation, particularly when there is a strong class imbalance. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance O-SFDA for adaptive object detection in mobile robots via unsupervised data acquisition. Our methodology prioritizes the most informative unlabeled frames for inclusion in the online training process. Empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset reveals that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art O-SFDA techniques, demonstrating the viability of unsupervised data acquisition for improving adaptive object detection in mobile robots.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video analytics is widely used in contemporary systems and services. At the forefront of video analytics are video queries that users develop to find objects of particular interest. Building upon the insight that video objects (e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics. This approach, named VQPy, consists of a frontend$\unicode{x2015}$a Python variant with constructs that make it easy for users to express video objects and their interactions$\unicode{x2015}$as well as an extensible backend that can automatically construct and optimize pipelines based on video objects. We have implemented and open-sourced VQPy, which has been productized in Cisco as part of its DeepVision framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Danesh Pazho, Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre, Vinit Katariya, Hamed Tabkhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing roadway safety has become an essential computer vision focus area for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potentials of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romain Thoreau, Laurent Risser, V\'eronique Achard, B\'eatrice Berthelot, Xavier Briottet</p>
<p>Abstract: Airborne hyperspectral images can be used to map the land cover in large urban areas, thanks to their very high spatial and spectral resolutions on a wide spectral domain. While the spectral dimension of hyperspectral images is highly informative of the chemical composition of the land surface, the use of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to map the land cover has been dramatically limited by the availability of training data. To cope with the scarcity of annotations, semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques have lately raised a lot of interest in the community. Yet, the publicly available hyperspectral data sets commonly used to benchmark machine learning models are not totally suited to evaluate their generalization performances due to one or several of the following properties: a limited geographical coverage (which does not reflect the spectral diversity in metropolitan areas), a small number of land cover classes and a lack of appropriate standard train / test splits for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning. Therefore, we release in this paper the Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set that stands out from other data sets in the above-mentioned respects in order to meet key issues in spectral representation learning and classification over large-scale hyperspectral images with very few labeled pixels. Besides, we discuss and experiment self-supervised techniques for spectral representation learning, including the Masked Autoencoder, and establish a baseline for pixel-wise classification achieving 85% overall accuracy and 77% F1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Savinay Nagendra, Chaopeng Shen, Daniel Kifer</p>
<p>Abstract: Landslides are a recurring, widespread hazard. Preparation and mitigation efforts can be aided by a high-quality, large-scale dataset that covers global at-risk areas. Such a dataset currently does not exist and is impossible to construct manually. Recent automated efforts focus on deep learning models for landslide segmentation (pixel labeling) from satellite imagery. However, it is also important to characterize the uncertainty or confidence levels of such segmentations. Accurate and robust uncertainty estimates can enable low-cost (in terms of manual labor) oversight of auto-generated landslide databases to resolve errors, identify hard negative examples, and increase the size of labeled training data. In this paper, we evaluate several methods for assessing pixel-level uncertainty of the segmentation. Three methods that do not require architectural changes were compared, including Pre-Threshold activations, Monte-Carlo Dropout and Test-Time Augmentation -- a method that measures the robustness of predictions in the face of data augmentation. Experimentally, the quality of the latter method was consistently higher than the others across a variety of models and metrics in our dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifan Yu, Juncheng Li, Longhui Wei, Liang Pang, Wentao Ye, Bosheng Qin, Siliang Tang, Qi Tian, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.

<p>Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims at localizing 3D object based on textual descriptions. Conventional supervised methods for 3DVG often necessitate extensive annotations and a predefined vocabulary, which can be restrictive. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual programming approach for zero-shot open-vocabulary 3DVG, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our approach begins with a unique dialog-based method, engaging with LLMs to establish a foundational understanding of zero-shot 3DVG. Building on this, we design a visual program that consists of three types of modules, i.e., view-independent, view-dependent, and functional modules. These modules, specifically tailored for 3D scenarios, work collaboratively to perform complex reasoning and inference. Furthermore, we develop an innovative language-object correlation module to extend the scope of existing 3D object detectors into open-vocabulary scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot approach can outperform some supervised baselines, marking a significant stride towards effective 3DVG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyang Gu, Saeed Vahidian, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, Haonan Wang, Wei Jiang, Yang You, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation reduces the storage and computational consumption of training a network by generating a small surrogate dataset that encapsulates rich information of the original large-scale one. However, previous distillation methods heavily rely on the sample-wise iterative optimization scheme. As the images-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger, the necessary computation will demand overwhelming time and resources. In this work, we intend to incorporate generative diffusion techniques for computing the surrogate dataset. Observing that key factors for constructing an effective surrogate dataset are representativeness and diversity, we design additional minimax criteria in the generative training to enhance these facets for the generated images of diffusion models. We present a theoretical model of the process as hierarchical diffusion control demonstrating the flexibility of the diffusion process to target these criteria without jeopardizing the faithfulness of the sample to the desired distribution. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art validation performance while demanding much less computational resources. Under the 100-IPC setting on ImageWoof, our method requires less than one-twentieth the distillation time of previous methods, yet yields even better performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Gong, Siteng Huang, Yutong Feng, Shiwei Zhang, Yuyuan Li, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in generating realistic images. However, challenges remain in accurately understanding and synthesizing the layout requirements in the textual prompts. To align the generated image with layout instructions, we present a training-free layout calibration system SimM that intervenes in the generative process on the fly during inference time. Specifically, following a "check-locate-rectify" pipeline, the system first analyses the prompt to generate the target layout and compares it with the intermediate outputs to automatically detect errors. Then, by moving the located activations and making intra- and inter-map adjustments, the rectification process can be performed with negligible computational overhead. To evaluate SimM over a range of layout requirements, we present a benchmark SimMBench that compensates for the lack of superlative spatial relations in existing datasets. And both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SimM in calibrating the layout inconsistencies. Our project page is at https://simm-t2i.github.io/SimM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siteng Huang, Biao Gong, Yutong Feng, Xi Chen, Yuqian Fu, Yu Liu, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study focuses on a novel task in text-to-image (T2I) generation, namely action customization. The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features, including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features, we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens, thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then, to block the inversion of action-agnostic features, ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task, we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions, each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation. Our project page is at https://adi-t2i.github.io/ADI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Haiwen Li, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su, Yuan Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Searching for specific person has great social benefits and security value, and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information. Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based, usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costly manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the CPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed Person Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%.

<p>Abstract: While pre-trained large-scale vision models have shown significant promise for semantic correspondence, their features often struggle to grasp the geometry and orientation of instances. This paper identifies the importance of being geometry-aware for semantic correspondence and reveals a limitation of the features of current foundation models under simple post-processing. We show that incorporating this information can markedly enhance semantic correspondence performance with simple but effective solutions in both zero-shot and supervised settings. We also construct a new challenging benchmark for semantic correspondence built from an existing animal pose estimation dataset, for both pre-training validating models. Our method achieves a PCK@0.10 score of 65.4 (zero-shot) and 85.6 (supervised) on the challenging SPair-71k dataset, outperforming the state of the art by 5.5p and 11.0p absolute gains, respectively.

<p>Abstract: We present Surf-D, a novel method for generating high-quality 3D shapes as Surfaces with arbitrary topologies using Diffusion models. Previous methods explored shape generation with different representations and they suffer from limited topologies and poor geometry details. To generate high-quality surfaces of arbitrary topologies, we use the Unsigned Distance Field (UDF) as our surface representation to accommodate arbitrary topologies. Furthermore, we propose a new pipeline that employs a point-based AutoEncoder to learn a compact and continuous latent space for accurately encoding UDF and support high-resolution mesh extraction. We further show that our new pipeline significantly outperforms the prior approaches to learning the distance fields, such as the grid-based AutoEncoder, which is not scalable and incapable of learning accurate UDF. In addition, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy to efficiently embed various surfaces. With the pretrained shape latent space, we employ a latent diffusion model to acquire the distribution of various shapes. Extensive experiments are presented on using Surf-D for unconditional generation, category conditional generation, image conditional generation, and text-to-shape tasks. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Surf-D in shape generation across multiple modalities as conditions. Visit our project page at https://yzmblog.github.io/projects/SurfD/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela Massiceti, Camilla Longden, Agnieszka S{\l}owik, Samuel Wills, Martin Grayson, Cecily Morrison</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) hold the potential to usher in a new era of automated visual assistance for people who are blind or low vision (BLV). Yet, these models have not been systematically evaluated on data captured by BLV users. We address this by empirically assessing CLIP, a widely-used LMM likely to underpin many assistive technologies. Testing 25 CLIP variants in a zero-shot classification task, we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content (e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content (e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training datasets: LAION-400M, LAION-2B and DataComp-1B, showing that disability content is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP: OWL-ViT, CLIPSeg and DALL-E2. We find that few-shot learning with as few as 5 images can mitigate CLIP's quality-of-service disparities for BLV users in some scenarios, which we discuss alongside a set of other possible mitigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Yao, Hongwen Zhang, Yunlian Sun, Jinhui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: For a long time, in reconstructing 3D human bodies from monocular images, most methods opted to simplify the task by minimizing the influence of the camera. Using a coarse focal length setting results in the reconstructed bodies not aligning well with distorted images. Ignoring camera rotation leads to an unrealistic reconstructed body pose in world space. Consequently, the application scenarios of existing methods are confined to controlled environments. When confronted with complex and diverse in-the-wild images, they struggle to achieve accurate and reasonable reconstruction in world space. To address the above issues, we propose W-HMR, which decouples global body recovery into camera calibration, local body recovery, and global body orientation correction. We design the first weak-supervised camera calibration method for body distortion, eliminating dependence on focal length labels and achieving finer mesh-image alignment. We propose a novel orientation correction module to allow the reconstructed human body to remain normal in world space. Decoupling body orientation and body pose enables our model to consider the accuracy in camera coordinate and the reasonableness in world coordinate simultaneously, expanding the range of applications. As a result, W-HMR achieves high-quality reconstruction in dual coordinate systems, particularly in challenging scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maud Biquard, Marie Chabert, Thomas Oberlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxin Li, Shiyi Lan, Jose M. Alvarez, Zuxuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the rise of query-based Transformer decoders is reshaping camera-based 3D object detection. These query-based decoders are surpassing the traditional dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based methods. However, we argue that dense BEV frameworks remain important due to their outstanding abilities in depth estimation and object localization, depicting 3D scenes accurately and comprehensively. This paper aims to address the drawbacks of the existing dense BEV-based 3D object detectors by introducing our proposed enhanced components, including a CRF-modulated depth estimation module enforcing object-level consistencies, a long-term temporal aggregation module with extended receptive fields, and a two-stage object decoder combining perspective techniques with CRF-modulated depth embedding. These enhancements lead to a "modernized" dense BEV framework dubbed BEVNeXt. On the nuScenes benchmark, BEVNeXt outperforms both BEV-based and query-based frameworks under various settings, achieving a state-of-the-art result of 64.2 NDS on the nuScenes test set.

<p>Abstract: We present GaussianAvatar, an efficient approach to creating realistic human avatars with dynamic 3D appearances from a single video. We start by introducing animatable 3D Gaussians to explicitly represent humans in various poses and clothing styles. Such an explicit and animatable representation can fuse 3D appearances more efficiently and consistently from 2D observations. Our representation is further augmented with dynamic properties to support pose-dependent appearance modeling, where a dynamic appearance network along with an optimizable feature tensor is designed to learn the motion-to-appearance mapping. Moreover, by leveraging the differentiable motion condition, our method enables a joint optimization of motions and appearances during avatar modeling, which helps to tackle the long-standing issue of inaccurate motion estimation in monocular settings. The efficacy of GaussianAvatar is validated on both the public dataset and our collected dataset, demonstrating its superior performances in terms of appearance quality and rendering efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new approach, termed GPS-Gaussian, for synthesizing novel views of a character in a real-time manner. The proposed method enables 2K-resolution rendering under a sparse-view camera setting. Unlike the original Gaussian Splatting or neural implicit rendering methods that necessitate per-subject optimizations, we introduce Gaussian parameter maps defined on the source views and regress directly Gaussian Splatting properties for instant novel view synthesis without any fine-tuning or optimization. To this end, we train our Gaussian parameter regression module on a large amount of human scan data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space. The proposed framework is fully differentiable and experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while achieving an exceeding rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoon-Gyu Chung, Seokjun Choi, Seung-Hwan Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: We present differentiable point-based inverse rendering, DPIR, an analysis-by-synthesis method that processes images captured under diverse illuminations to estimate shape and spatially-varying BRDF. To this end, we adopt point-based rendering, eliminating the need for multiple samplings per ray, typical of volumetric rendering, thus significantly enhancing the speed of inverse rendering. To realize this idea, we devise a hybrid point-volumetric representation for geometry and a regularized basis-BRDF representation for reflectance. The hybrid geometric representation enables fast rendering through point-based splatting while retaining the geometric details and stability inherent to SDF-based representations. The regularized basis-BRDF mitigates the ill-posedness of inverse rendering stemming from limited light-view angular samples. We also propose an efficient shadow detection method using point-based shadow map rendering. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DPIR outperforms prior works in terms of reconstruction accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory footprint. Furthermore, our explicit point-based representation and rendering enables intuitive geometry and reflectance editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroush Abbasi Koohpayegani, Anuj Singh, K L Navaneet, Hadi Jamali-Rad, Hamed Pirsiavash</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial in training deep models, preventing them from overfitting to limited data. Recent advances in generative AI, e.g., diffusion models, have enabled more sophisticated augmentation techniques that produce data resembling natural images. We introduce GeNIe a novel augmentation method which leverages a latent diffusion model conditioned on a text prompt to merge contrasting data points (an image from the source category and a text prompt from the target category) to generate challenging samples. To achieve this, inspired by recent diffusion based image editing techniques, we limit the number of diffusion iterations to ensure the generated image retains low-level and background features from the source image while representing the target category, resulting in a hard negative sample for the source category. We further enhance the proposed approach by finding the appropriate noise level adaptively for each image (coined as GeNIe-Ada) leading to further performance improvement. Our extensive experiments, in both few-shot and long-tail distribution settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel augmentation method and its superior performance over the prior art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhe Zhang, Bocheng Zou, Ruichuan An, Jiaming Liu, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth in the scale of pre-trained foundation models, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques have gained significant attention, among which Adapter Tuning is the most widely used. Despite achieving efficiency, it still underperforms full fine-tuning, and the performance improves at the cost of an increase in parameters. Recent efforts have either focused on training multiple adapter experts to increase model capacity or on pruning adapters to achieve parameter efficiency. However, both approaches introduce more parameters compared to the original adapter, hence are not computationally efficient. Motivated by this, we propose Mixture of Sparse Adapters, or MoSA, as a novel Adapter Tuning method to fully unleash the potential of each parameter in the adapter. We first split the standard adapter into multiple non-overlapping modules, then stochastically activate them for sparse training, and finally merge them to form a complete adapter after tuning. In this way, MoSA can achieve significantly better performance than standard adapters without any additional computational or storage overhead. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical sparse strategy to better leverage limited training data. Extensive experiments on a series of 27 visual tasks demonstrate that MoSA consistently outperforms other Adapter Tuning methods as well as other baselines by a large margin. Furthermore, MoSA brings consistent improvements across various model scales, architectures, and different PEFT methods. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Rao, Eduardo Perez Pellitero, Benjamin Busam, Yiren Zhou, Jifei Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D avatar generation excel with multi-view supervision for photorealistic models. However, monocular counterparts lag in quality despite broader applicability. We propose ReCaLaB to close this gap. ReCaLaB is a fully-differentiable pipeline that learns high-fidelity 3D human avatars from just a single RGB video. A pose-conditioned deformable NeRF is optimized to volumetrically represent a human subject in canonical T-pose. The canonical representation is then leveraged to efficiently associate neural textures using 2D-3D correspondences. This enables the separation of diffused color generation and lighting correction branches that jointly compose an RGB prediction. The design allows to control intermediate results for human pose, body shape, texture, and lighting with text prompts. An image-conditioned diffusion model thereby helps to animate appearance and pose of the 3D avatar to create video sequences with previously unseen human motion. Extensive experiments show that ReCaLaB outperforms previous monocular approaches in terms of image quality for image synthesis tasks. Moreover, natural language offers an intuitive user interface for creative manipulation of 3D human avatars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Lu, Jing Lin, Hongkun Dou, Ailing Zeng, Yue Deng, Yulun Zhang, Haoqian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work targets to construct a robust human pose prior. However, it remains a persistent challenge due to biomechanical constraints and diverse human movements. Traditional priors like VAEs and NDFs often exhibit shortcomings in realism and generalization, notably with unseen noisy poses. To address these issues, we introduce DPoser, a robust and versatile human pose prior built upon diffusion models. DPoser regards various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems and employs variational diffusion sampling for efficient solving. Accordingly, designed with optimization frameworks, DPoser seamlessly benefits human mesh recovery, pose generation, pose completion, and motion denoising tasks. Furthermore, due to the disparity between the articulated poses and structured images, we propose truncated timestep scheduling to enhance the effectiveness of DPoser. Our approach demonstrates considerable enhancements over common uniform scheduling used in image domains, boasting improvements of 5.4%, 17.2%, and 3.8% across human mesh recovery, pose completion, and motion denoising, respectively. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DPoser over existing state-of-the-art pose priors across multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Sun, Fanghua Ye, Shaogang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed image retrieval attempts to retrieve an image of interest from gallery images through a composed query of a reference image and its corresponding modified text. It has recently attracted attention due to the collaboration of information-rich images and concise language to precisely express the requirements of target images. Most current composed image retrieval methods follow a supervised learning approach to training on a costly triplet dataset composed of a reference image, modified text, and a corresponding target image. To avoid difficult to-obtain labeled triplet training data, zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) has been introduced, which aims to retrieve the target image by learning from image-text pairs (self-supervised triplets), without the need for human-labeled triplets. However, this self-supervised triplet learning approach is computationally less effective and less understandable as it assumes the interaction between image and text is conducted with implicit query embedding without explicit semantical interpretation. In this work, we present a new training-free zero-shot composed image retrieval method which translates the query into explicit human-understandable text. This helps improve model learning efficiency to enhance the generalization capacity of foundation models. Further, we introduce a Local Concept Re-ranking (LCR) mechanism to focus on discriminative local information extracted from the modified instructions. Extensive experiments on four ZS-CIR benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable performances to that of the state of-the-art triplet training based methods, but significantly outperforms other training-free methods on the open domain datasets (CIRR, CIRCO and COCO), as well as the fashion domain dataset (FashionIQ).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Radl, Michael Steiner, Andreas Kurz, Markus Steinberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the omnipresence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the interest towards editable implicit 3D representations has surged over the last years. However, editing implicit or hybrid representations as used for NeRFs is difficult due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry encoded in the model parameters. Despite these challenges, recent research has shown first promising steps towards photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance edits. The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity, a lack of support for local edits and large memory requirements, rendering them less useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF, a unified framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs. To tackle local editing, we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final output color, which can optionally be supervised by a style loss, resulting in a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping, we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee interactivity, we compose the output color using a set of learned, modifiable base colors, composed with additive layer mixing. Compared to concurrent work, LAENeRF enables recoloring and stylization while keeping processing time low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper is not motivated to seek innovation within the attention mechanism. Instead, it focuses on overcoming the existing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency within the context of point cloud processing, leveraging the power of scale. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in 3D large-scale representation learning, we recognize that model performance is more influenced by scale than by intricate design. Therefore, we present Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), which prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over the accuracy of certain mechanisms that are minor to the overall performance after scaling, such as replacing the precise neighbor search by KNN with an efficient serialized neighbor mapping of point clouds organized with specific patterns. This principle enables significant scaling, expanding the receptive field from 16 to 1024 points while remaining efficient (a 3x increase in processing speed and a 10x improvement in memory efficiency compared with its predecessor, PTv2). PTv3 attains state-of-the-art results on over 20 downstream tasks that span both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Further enhanced with multi-dataset joint training, PTv3 pushes these results to a higher level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingda Yin, Yuzheng Liu, Yang Xiao, Daniel Cohen-Or, Jingwei Huang, Baoquan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in 3D instance segmentation have traditionally been tethered to the availability of annotated datasets, limiting their application to a narrow spectrum of object categories. Recent efforts have sought to harness vision-language models like CLIP for open-set semantic reasoning, yet these methods struggle to distinguish between objects of the same categories and rely on specific prompts that are not universally applicable. In this paper, we introduce SAI3D, a novel zero-shot 3D instance segmentation approach that synergistically leverages geometric priors and semantic cues derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our method partitions a 3D scene into geometric primitives, which are then progressively merged into 3D instance segmentations that are consistent with the multi-view SAM masks. Moreover, we design a hierarchical region-growing algorithm with a dynamic thresholding mechanism, which largely improves the robustness of finegrained 3D scene parsing.Empirical evaluations on ScanNet, Matterport3D and the more challenging ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, SAI3D outperforms existing open-vocabulary baselines and even surpasses fully-supervised methods in class-agnostic segmentation on ScanNet++.

We make the following contributions: (i) we design a transformer-based sampling architecture that can process long videos conditioned on a task, together with a training method that enables it to bridge pre-trained visual and language models; (ii) we identify tasks that could benefit from longer video perception; and (iii) we empirically validate its efficacy on a wide variety of evaluation tasks including NextQA, EgoSchema, and the EGO4D-LTA challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Xien Chng, Henry Zheng, Yizeng Han, Xuchong Qiu, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that requires an algorithm to segment objects referred by free-form language expressions. Despite significant progress in recent years, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still suffer from considerable language-image modality gap at the pixel and word level. These methods generally 1) rely on sentence-level language features for language-image alignment and 2) lack explicit training supervision for fine-grained visual grounding. Consequently, they exhibit weak object-level correspondence between visual and language features. Without well-grounded features, prior methods struggle to understand complex expressions that require strong reasoning over relationships among multiple objects, especially when dealing with rarely used or ambiguous clauses. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Mask Grounding auxiliary task that significantly improves visual grounding within language features, by explicitly teaching the model to learn fine-grained correspondence between masked textual tokens and their matching visual objects. Mask Grounding can be directly used on prior RIS methods and consistently bring improvements. Furthermore, to holistically address the modality gap, we also design a cross-modal alignment loss and an accompanying alignment module. These additions work synergistically with Mask Grounding. With all these techniques, our comprehensive approach culminates in MagNet (Mask-grounded Network), an architecture that significantly outperforms prior arts on three key benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref), demonstrating our method's effectiveness in addressing current limitations of RIS algorithms. Our code and pre-trained weights will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized text-to-image (T2I) models have revolutionized content creation, empowering non-experts to generate stunning images with unique styles. While promising, adding realistic motions into these personalized images by text poses significant challenges in preserving distinct styles, high-fidelity details, and achieving motion controllability by text. In this paper, we present PIA, a Personalized Image Animator that excels in aligning with condition images, achieving motion controllability by text, and the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning. To achieve these goals, PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained temporal alignment layers, allowing for the seamless transformation of any personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is the introduction of the condition module, which utilizes the condition frame and inter-frame affinity as input to transfer appearance information guided by the affinity hint for individual frame synthesis in the latent space. This design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related image alignment within and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinying Liu, Wei Wu, Kecheng Zheng, Zhan Tong, Yu Liu, Wei Chen, Zilei Wang, Yujun Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The crux of learning vision-language models is to extract semantically aligned information from visual and linguistic data. Existing attempts usually face the problem of coarse alignment, e.g., the vision encoder struggles in localizing an attribute-specified object. In this work, we propose an embarrassingly simple approach to better align image and text features with no need of additional data formats other than image-text pairs. Concretely, given an image and its paired text, we manage to parse objects (\textit{e.g.}, cat) and attributes (\textit{e.g.}, black) from the description, which are highly likely to exist in the image. It is noteworthy that the parsing pipeline is fully automatic and thus enjoys good scalability. With these parsed semantics as supervision signals, we can complement the commonly used image-text contrastive loss with the multi-tag classification loss. Extensive experimental results on a broad suite of semantic segmentation datasets substantiate the average 5.2\% improvement of our framework over existing alternatives. Furthermore, the visualization results indicate that attribute supervision makes vision-language models accurately localize attribute-specified objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxi Yue, Jing Zhang, Kun Hu, Qiuxia Wu, Zongyuan Ge, Yong Xia, Jiebo Luo, Zhiyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits promise in generic object segmentation and offers potential for various applications. Existing methods have applied SAM to surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) by tuning SAM-based frameworks with surgical data. However, they fall short in two crucial aspects: (1) Straightforward model tuning with instrument masks treats each instrument as a single entity, neglecting their complex structures and fine-grained details; and (2) Instrument category-based prompts are not flexible and informative enough to describe instrument structures. To address these problems, in this paper, we investigate text promptable SIS and propose SurgicalPart-SAM (SP-SAM), a novel SAM efficient-tuning approach that explicitly integrates instrument structure knowledge with SAM's generic knowledge, guided by expert knowledge on instrument part compositions. Specifically, we achieve this by proposing (1) Collaborative Prompts that describe instrument structures via collaborating category-level and part-level texts; (2) Cross-Modal Prompt Encoder that encodes text prompts jointly with visual embeddings into discriminative part-level representations; and (3) Part-to-Whole Adaptive Fusion and Hierarchical Decoding that adaptively fuse the part-level representations into a whole for accurate instrument segmentation in surgical scenarios. Built upon them, SP-SAM acquires a better capability to comprehend surgical instruments in terms of both overall structure and part-level details. Extensive experiments on both the EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets demonstrate SP-SAM's state-of-the-art performance with minimal tunable parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Haitao Zhou, Chuang Wang, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu, Qian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVGs) synthesis has shown promise in domains such as iconography and sketch. However, existing text-to-SVG generation methods lack editability and struggle with visual quality and result diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method called SVGDreamer. SVGDreamer incorporates a semantic-driven image vectorization (SIVE) process that enables the decomposition of synthesis into foreground objects and background, thereby enhancing editability. Specifically, the SIVE process introduce attention-based primitive control and an attention-mask loss function for effective control and manipulation of individual elements. Additionally, we propose a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach to tackle the challenges of shape over-smoothing, color over-saturation, limited diversity in results, and slow convergence in existing text-to-SVG generation methods. VPSD models SVGs as distributions of control points and colors to counteract over-smoothing and over-saturation. Furthermore, VPSD leverages a reward model to reweight vector particles, which improves aesthetic appeal and accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of SVGDreamer, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. The code and demo of SVGDreamer can be found at https://ximinng.github.io/SVGDreamer-project/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Liu, Zihao Zhu, Giorgio Becherini, Yichen Peng, Mingyang Su, You Zhou, Xuefei Zhe, Naoya Iwamoto, Bo Zheng, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose EMAGE, a framework to generate full-body human gestures from audio and masked gestures, encompassing facial, local body, hands, and global movements. To achieve this, we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME), a new mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines MoShed SMPLX body with FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head, neck, and finger movements, offering a community-standardized, high-quality 3D motion captured dataset. EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer, facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements. Moreover, EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs, generating complete, audio-synchronized results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunpeng Zhou, Haishuai Wang, Xilu Yuan, Zhi Yu, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Learning aims to learn and distinguish new categories with a very limited number of available images, presenting a significant challenge in the realm of deep learning. Recent researchers have sought to leverage the additional textual or linguistic information of these rare categories with a pre-trained language model to facilitate learning, thus partially alleviating the problem of insufficient supervision signals. However, the full potential of the textual information and pre-trained language model have been underestimated in the few-shot learning till now, resulting in limited performance enhancements. To address this, we propose a simple but effective framework for few-shot learning tasks, specifically designed to exploit the textual information and language model. In more detail, we explicitly exploit the zero-shot capability of the pre-trained language model with the learnable prompt. And we just add the visual feature with the textual feature for inference directly without the intricate designed fusion modules in previous works. Additionally, we apply the self-ensemble and distillation to further enhance these components. Our extensive experiments conducted across four widely used few-shot datasets demonstrate that our simple framework achieves impressive results. Particularly noteworthy is its outstanding performance in the 1-shot learning task, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.0\% in classification accuracy. \footnote{We will make the source codes of the proposed framework publicly available upon acceptance. }.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligned text-image encoders such as CLIP have become the de facto model for vision-language tasks. Furthermore, modality-specific encoders achieve impressive performances in their respective domains. This raises a central question: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and language encoders since they fundamentally represent the same physical world? Analyzing the latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption benchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), we find that the representation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically similar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders like CLIP, we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists without any training. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting the semantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast Quadratic Assignment Problem optimization, and a novel localized CKA metric-based matching/retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this on several downstream tasks including cross-lingual, cross-domain caption matching and image classification.

<p>Abstract: Humans commonly work with multiple objects in daily life and can intuitively transfer manipulation skills to novel objects by understanding object functional regularities. However, existing technical approaches for analyzing and synthesizing hand-object manipulation are mostly limited to handling a single hand and object due to the lack of data support. To address this, we construct TACO, an extensive bimanual hand-object-interaction dataset spanning a large variety of tool-action-object compositions for daily human activities. TACO contains 2.5K motion sequences paired with third-person and egocentric views, precise hand-object 3D meshes, and action labels. To rapidly expand the data scale, we present a fully automatic data acquisition pipeline combining multi-view sensing with an optical motion capture system. With the vast research fields provided by TACO, we benchmark three generalizable hand-object-interaction tasks: compositional action recognition, generalizable hand-object motion forecasting, and cooperative grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments reveal new insights, challenges, and opportunities for advancing the studies of generalizable hand-object motion analysis and synthesis.

<p>Abstract: One-shot 3D talking portrait generation aims to reconstruct a 3D avatar from an unseen image, and then animate it with a reference video or audio to generate a talking portrait video. The existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve the goals of accurate 3D avatar reconstruction and stable talking face animation. Besides, while the existing works mainly focus on synthesizing the head part, it is also vital to generate natural torso and background segments to obtain a realistic talking portrait video. To address these limitations, we present Real3D-Potrait, a framework that (1) improves the one-shot 3D reconstruction power with a large image-to-plane model that distills 3D prior knowledge from a 3D face generative model; (2) facilitates accurate motion-conditioned animation with an efficient motion adapter; (3) synthesizes realistic video with natural torso movement and switchable background using a head-torso-background super-resolution model; and (4) supports one-shot audio-driven talking face generation with a generalizable audio-to-motion model. Extensive experiments show that Real3D-Portrait generalizes well to unseen identities and generates more realistic talking portrait videos compared to previous methods.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, the LCV2 modular method is proposed for the Grounded Visual Question Answering task in the vision-language multimodal domain. This approach relies on a frozen large language model (LLM) as intermediate mediator between the off-the-shelf VQA model and the off-the-shelf visual grounding (VG) model, where the LLM transforms and conveys textual information between the two modules based on a designed prompt. LCV2 establish an integrated plug-and-play framework without the need for any pre-training process. This framework can be deployed for VQA Grounding tasks under low computational resources. The modularized model within the framework allows application with various state-of-the-art pre-trained models, exhibiting significant potential to be advance with the times. Experimental implementations were conducted under constrained computational and memory resources, evaluating the proposed method's performance on benchmark datasets including GQA, CLEVR, and VizWiz-VQA-Grounding. Comparative analyses with baseline methods demonstrate the robust competitiveness of LCV2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianbin Jiao, Xina Cheng, Weijie Chen, Xiaoting Yin, Hao Shi, Kailun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human pose estimation captures the human joint points in three-dimensional space while keeping the depth information and physical structure. That is essential for applications that require precise pose information, such as human-computer interaction, scene understanding, and rehabilitation training. Due to the challenges in data collection, mainstream datasets of 3D human pose estimation are primarily composed of multi-view video data collected in laboratory environments, which contains rich spatial-temporal correlation information besides the image frame content. Given the remarkable self-attention mechanism of transformers, capable of capturing the spatial-temporal correlation from multi-view video datasets, we propose a multi-stage framework for 3D sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) human pose detection. Firstly, the spatial module represents the human pose feature by intra-image content, while the frame-image relation module extracts temporal relationships and 3D spatial positional relationship features between the multi-perspective images. Secondly, the self-attention mechanism is adopted to eliminate the interference from non-human body parts and reduce computing resources. Our method is evaluated on Human3.6M, a popular 3D human pose detection dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Jun Liu, Liang Zheng, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Video sequences exhibit significant nuisance variations (undesired effects) of speed of actions, temporal locations, and subjects' poses, leading to temporal-viewpoint misalignment when comparing two sets of frames or evaluating the similarity of two sequences. Thus, we propose Joint tEmporal and cAmera viewpoiNt alIgnmEnt (JEANIE) for sequence pairs. In particular, we focus on 3D skeleton sequences whose camera and subjects' poses can be easily manipulated in 3D. We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), where matching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) of support-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) is essential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, we create its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a support sequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can be matched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporal index, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpoint warping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths with different temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which only performs temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin to clustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure. JEANIE achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120, Kinetics-skeleton and UWA3D Multiview Activity II on supervised and unsupervised FSAR, and their meta-learning inspired fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanli Ma, Oktay Karakus, Paul L. Rosin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of knowledge distillation has played a crucial role in enabling the transfer of knowledge from larger teacher models to smaller and more efficient student models, and is particularly beneficial for online and resource-constrained applications. The effectiveness of the student model heavily relies on the quality of the distilled knowledge received from the teacher. Given the accessibility of unlabelled remote sensing data, semi-supervised learning has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing model performance. However, relying solely on semi-supervised learning with smaller models may be insufficient due to their limited capacity for feature extraction. This limitation restricts their ability to exploit training data. To address this issue, we propose an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning methods. This hybrid approach leverages the robust capabilities of large models to effectively utilise large unlabelled data whilst subsequently providing the small student model with rich and informative features for enhancement. The proposed semi-supervised learning-based knowledge distillation (SSLKD) approach demonstrates a notable improvement in the performance of the student model, in the application of road segmentation, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional semi-supervised learning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents BioNeRF, a biologically plausible architecture that models scenes in a 3D representation and synthesizes new views through radiance fields. Since NeRF relies on the network weights to store the scene's 3-dimensional representation, BioNeRF implements a cognitive-inspired mechanism that fuses inputs from multiple sources into a memory-like structure, improving the storing capacity and extracting more intrinsic and correlated information. BioNeRF also mimics a behavior observed in pyramidal cells concerning contextual information, in which the memory is provided as the context and combined with the inputs of two subsequent neural models, one responsible for producing the volumetric densities and the other the colors used to render the scene. Experimental results show that BioNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art results concerning a quality measure that encodes human perception in two datasets: real-world images and synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bird's-eye view (BEV) maps are an important geometrically structured representation widely used in robotics, in particular self-driving vehicles and terrestrial robots. Existing algorithms either require depth information for the geometric projection, which is not always reliably available, or are trained end-to-end in a fully supervised way to map visual first-person observations to BEV representation, and are therefore restricted to the output modality they have been trained for. In contrast, we propose a new model capable of performing zero-shot projections of any modality available in a first person view to the corresponding BEV map. This is achieved by disentangling the geometric inverse perspective projection from the modality transformation, eg. RGB to occupancy. The method is general and we showcase experiments projecting to BEV three different modalities: semantic segmentation, motion vectors and object bounding boxes detected in first person. We experimentally show that the model outperforms competing methods, in particular the widely used baseline resorting to monocular depth estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in image restoration, largely attributed to the development of modern deep neural networks, such as CNNs and Transformers. However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhao Zhang, Kunyu Wang, Rongtao Xu, Gengze Zhou, Yicong Hong, Xiaomeng Fang, Qi Wu, Zhizheng Zhang, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) stands as a key research problem of Embodied AI, aiming at enabling agents to navigate in unseen environments following linguistic instructions. In this field, generalization is a long-standing challenge, either to out-of-distribution scenes or from Sim to Real. In this paper, we propose NaVid, a video-based large vision language model (VLM), to mitigate such a generalization gap. NaVid makes the first endeavour to showcase the capability of VLMs to achieve state-of-the-art level navigation performance without any maps, odometer and depth inputs. Following human instruction, NaVid only requires an on-the-fly video stream from a monocular RGB camera equipped on the robot to output the next-step action. Our formulation mimics how humans navigate and naturally gets rid of the problems introduced by odometer noises, and the Sim2Real gaps from map or depth inputs. Moreover, our video-based approach can effectively encode the historical observations of robots as spatio-temporal contexts for decision-making and instruction following. We train NaVid with 550k navigation samples collected from VLN-CE trajectories, including action-planning and instruction-reasoning samples, along with 665k large-scale web data. Extensive experiments show that NaVid achieves SOTA performance in simulation environments and the real world, demonstrating superior cross-dataset and Sim2Real transfer. We thus believe our proposed VLM approach plans the next step for not only the navigation agents but also this research field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Lai, Qingsong Yao, Zihang Jiang, Rongsheng Wang, Zhiyang He, Xiaodong Tao, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Zero-Shot Learning in the medical domain has been driven forward by using pre-trained models on large-scale image-text pairs, focusing on image-text alignment. However, existing methods primarily rely on cosine similarity for alignment, which may not fully capture the complex relationship between medical images and reports. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach called Cross-Attention Alignment for Radiology Zero-Shot Classification (CARZero). Our approach innovatively leverages cross-attention mechanisms to process image and report features, creating a Similarity Representation that more accurately reflects the intricate relationships in medical semantics. This representation is then linearly projected to form an image-text similarity matrix for cross-modality alignment. Additionally, recognizing the pivotal role of prompt selection in zero-shot learning, CARZero incorporates a Large Language Model-based prompt alignment strategy. This strategy standardizes diverse diagnostic expressions into a unified format for both training and inference phases, overcoming the challenges of manual prompt design. Our approach is simple yet effective, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification on five official chest radiograph diagnostic test sets, including remarkable results on datasets with long-tail distributions of rare diseases. This achievement is attributed to our new image-text alignment strategy, which effectively addresses the complex relationship between medical images and reports.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Li, Ye Shi, Qian Yu, Jingya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images sharing the same category across diverse domains without relying on labeled data. Prior approaches have typically decomposed the UCIR problem into two distinct tasks: intra-domain representation learning and cross-domain feature alignment. However, these segregated strategies overlook the potential synergies between these tasks. This paper introduces ProtoOT, a novel Optimal Transport formulation explicitly tailored for UCIR, which integrates intra-domain feature representation learning and cross-domain alignment into a unified framework. ProtoOT leverages the strengths of the K-means clustering method to effectively manage distribution imbalances inherent in UCIR. By utilizing K-means for generating initial prototypes and approximating class marginal distributions, we modify the constraints in Optimal Transport accordingly, significantly enhancing its performance in UCIR scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate contrastive learning into the ProtoOT framework to further improve representation learning. This encourages local semantic consistency among features with similar semantics, while also explicitly enforcing separation between features and unmatched prototypes, thereby enhancing global discriminativeness. ProtoOT surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin across benchmark datasets. Notably, on DomainNet, ProtoOT achieves an average P@200 enhancement of 24.44%, and on Office-Home, it demonstrates a P@15 improvement of 12.12%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenny Seidenschwarz, Aljo\v{s}a O\v{s}ep, Francesco Ferroni, Simon Lucey, Laura Leal-Taix\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle semi-supervised object detection based on motion cues. Recent results suggest that heuristic-based clustering methods in conjunction with object trackers can be used to pseudo-label instances of moving objects and use these as supervisory signals to train 3D object detectors in Lidar data without manual supervision. We re-think this approach and suggest that both, object detection, as well as motion-inspired pseudo-labeling, can be tackled in a data-driven manner. We leverage recent advances in scene flow estimation to obtain point trajectories from which we extract long-term, class-agnostic motion patterns. Revisiting correlation clustering in the context of message passing networks, we learn to group those motion patterns to cluster points to object instances. By estimating the full extent of the objects, we obtain per-scan 3D bounding boxes that we use to supervise a Lidar object detection network. Our method not only outperforms prior heuristic-based approaches (57.5 AP, +14 improvement over prior work), more importantly, we show we can pseudo-label and train object detectors across datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohong Li, Wei He, Jiepan Li, Fangxiao Lu, Hongyan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale high-resolution (HR) land-cover mapping is a vital task to survey the Earth's surface and resolve many challenges facing humanity. However, it is still a non-trivial task hindered by complex ground details, various landforms, and the scarcity of accurate training labels over a wide-span geographic area. In this paper, we propose an efficient, weakly supervised framework (Paraformer) to guide large-scale HR land-cover mapping with easy-access historical land-cover data of low resolution (LR). Specifically, existing land-cover mapping approaches reveal the dominance of CNNs in preserving local ground details but still suffer from insufficient global modeling in various landforms. Therefore, we design a parallel CNN-Transformer feature extractor in Paraformer, consisting of a downsampling-free CNN branch and a Transformer branch, to jointly capture local and global contextual information. Besides, facing the spatial mismatch of training data, a pseudo-label-assisted training (PLAT) module is adopted to reasonably refine LR labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation of HR images. Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of Paraformer over other state-of-the-art methods for automatically updating HR land-cover maps from LR historical labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwen He, Yifan Wang, Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu, Jun-Yan He, Jin-Peng Lan, Bin Luo, Xuansong Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLMs) leverages Large Language Models as a cognitive framework for diverse visual-language tasks. Recent efforts have been made to equip MLLMs with visual perceiving and grounding capabilities. However, there still remains a gap in providing fine-grained pixel-level perceptions and extending interactions beyond text-specific inputs. In this work, we propose {\bf{AnyRef}}, a general MLLM model that can generate pixel-wise object perceptions and natural language descriptions from multi-modality references, such as texts, boxes, images, or audio. This innovation empowers users with greater flexibility to engage with the model beyond textual and regional prompts, without modality-specific designs. Through our proposed refocusing mechanism, the generated grounding output is guided to better focus on the referenced object, implicitly incorporating additional pixel-level supervision. This simple modification utilizes attention scores generated during the inference of LLM, eliminating the need for extra computations while exhibiting performance enhancements in both grounding masks and referring expressions. With only publicly available training data, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including diverse modality referring segmentation and region-level referring expression generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Abstract reasoning problems challenge the perceptual and cognitive abilities of AI algorithms, demanding deeper pattern discernment and inductive reasoning beyond explicit image features. This study introduces PMoC, a tailored probability model for the Bongard-Logo problem, achieving high reasoning accuracy by constructing independent probability models. Additionally, we present Pose-Transformer, an enhanced Transformer-Encoder designed for complex abstract reasoning tasks, including Bongard-Logo, RAVEN, I-RAVEN, and PGM. Pose-Transformer incorporates positional information learning, inspired by capsule networks' pose matrices, enhancing its focus on local positional relationships in image data processing. When integrated with PMoC, it further improves reasoning accuracy. Our approach effectively addresses reasoning difficulties associated with abstract entities' positional changes, outperforming previous models on the OIG, D3$\times$3 subsets of RAVEN, and PGM databases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhuo Song, Beiming Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract reasoning problems pose significant challenges to artificial intelligence algorithms, demanding cognitive capabilities beyond those required for perception tasks. This study introduces the Triple-CFN approach to tackle the Bongard-Logo problem, achieving notable reasoning accuracy by implicitly reorganizing the concept space of conflicting instances. Additionally, the Triple-CFN paradigm proves effective for the RPM problem with necessary modifications, yielding competitive results. To further enhance performance on the RPM issue, we develop the Meta Triple-CFN network, which explicitly structures the problem space while maintaining interpretability on progressive patterns. The success of Meta Triple-CFN is attributed to its paradigm of modeling the conceptual space, equivalent to normalizing reasoning information. Based on this ideology, we introduce the Re-space layer, enhancing the performance of both Meta Triple-CFN and Triple-CFN. This paper aims to contribute to advancements in machine intelligence by exploring innovative network designs for addressing abstract reasoning problems, paving the way for further breakthroughs in this domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper achieves noteworthy progress in the realm of abstract reasoning, particularly in addressing Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Bongard-Logo challenges. Initially, we introduce Lico-Net, a novel baseline model that resolves RPM problems with remarkable accuracy. Leveraging this foundation, we advance with the D3C approach, which advocates representing the underlying concepts in abstract reasoning problems through distributions. This perspective enhances the performance of both Lico-Net and a baseline model excelling in Bongard-Logo tasks. To bolster the computational efficiency of D3C, we present the D3C-cos variant, offering a streamlined yet precise solution. Furthermore, we propose the D2C method, redefining conceptual boundaries within these domains and bridging the divide between high-level abstractions and their lower-dimensional counterparts. Finally, we extend our methodology to D4C, employing adversarial techniques to refine conceptual boundaries further and demonstrate substantial improvements in both RPM and Bongard-Logo challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian B. Moser, Federico Raue, Sebastian Palacio, Stanislav Frolov, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficacy of machine learning has traditionally relied on the availability of increasingly larger datasets. However, large datasets pose storage challenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during training without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to these limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into a condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged. One crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking the original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if the employed model architecture differs from the model used during distillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images, e.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with dataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel diffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the gradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the trade-off between speed and accuracy. We evaluate our approach in several ImageNet subsets and for high-resolution images (128x128 and 256x256). As a result, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation techniques by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Peng, Yutao Tang, Yifan Zhou, Nengyu Wang, Xijun Liu, Deming Li, Rama Chellappa</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts in using 3D Gaussians for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis can achieve impressive results on curated benchmarks; however, images captured in real life are often blurry. In this work, we analyze the robustness of Gaussian-Splatting-based methods against various image blur, such as motion blur, defocus blur, downscaling blur, \etc. Under these degradations, Gaussian-Splatting-based methods tend to overfit and produce worse results than Neural-Radiance-Field-based methods. To address this issue, we propose Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS). BAGS introduces additional 2D modeling capacities such that a 3D-consistent and high quality scene can be reconstructed despite image-wise blur. Specifically, we model blur by estimating per-pixel convolution kernels from a Blur Proposal Network (BPN). BPN is designed to consider spatial, color, and depth variations of the scene to maximize modeling capacity. Additionally, BPN also proposes a quality-assessing mask, which indicates regions where blur occur. Finally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme; this optimization scheme is fast and avoids sub-optimal solutions due to a sparse point cloud initialization, which often occurs when we apply Structure-from-Motion on blurry images. We demonstrate that BAGS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging blur conditions and imaging geometry, while significantly improving upon existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased impressive skills in tasks related to visual understanding and reasoning. Yet, their widespread application faces obstacles due to the high computational demands during both the training and inference phases, restricting their use to a limited audience within the research and user communities. In this paper, we investigate the design aspects of Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) and propose an efficient multimodal assistant named Mipha, which is designed to create synergy among various aspects: visual representation, language models, and optimization strategies. We show that without increasing the volume of training data, our Mipha-3B outperforms the state-of-the-art large MLLMs, especially LLaVA-1.5-13B, on multiple benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengda Zhang, Qianpei He, Kun Kuang, Jiashuo Liu, Long Chen, Chao Wu, Jun Xiao, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Attribute Classification (FAC) holds substantial promise in widespread applications. However, FAC models trained by traditional methodologies can be unfair by exhibiting accuracy inconsistencies across varied data subpopulations. This unfairness is largely attributed to bias in data, where some spurious attributes (e.g., Male) statistically correlate with the target attribute (e.g., Smiling). Most of existing fairness-aware methods rely on the labels of spurious attributes, which may be unavailable in practice. This work proposes a novel, generation-based two-stage framework to train a fair FAC model on biased data without additional annotation. Initially, we identify the potential spurious attributes based on generative models. Notably, it enhances interpretability by explicitly showing the spurious attributes in image space. Following this, for each image, we first edit the spurious attributes with a random degree sampled from a uniform distribution, while keeping target attribute unchanged. Then we train a fair FAC model by fostering model invariance to these augmentation. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in promoting fairness in FAC without compromising accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Chen, Haozhe Zhao, Tianyu Liu, Shuai Bai, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou, Baobao Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we identify the inefficient attention phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), notably within prominent models like LLaVA-1.5, QwenVL-Chat and Video-LLaVA. We find out that the attention computation over visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs, suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a 45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models. Code is released at https://github.com/pkunlp-icler/FastV.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose FocusCLIP, integrating subject-level guidance--a specialized mechanism for target-specific supervision--into the CLIP framework for improved zero-shot transfer on human-centric tasks. Our novel contributions enhance CLIP on both the vision and text sides. On the vision side, we incorporate ROI heatmaps emulating human visual attention mechanisms to emphasize subject-relevant image regions. On the text side, we introduce human pose descriptions to provide rich contextual information. For human-centric tasks, FocusCLIP is trained with images from the MPII Human Pose dataset. The proposed approach surpassed CLIP by an average of 8.61% across five previously unseen datasets covering three human-centric tasks. FocusCLIP achieved an average accuracy of 33.65% compared to 25.04% by CLIP. We observed a 3.98% improvement in activity recognition, a 14.78% improvement in age classification, and a 7.06% improvement in emotion recognition. Moreover, using our proposed single-shot LLM prompting strategy, we release a high-quality MPII Pose Descriptions dataset to encourage further research in multimodal learning for human-centric tasks. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our subject-level supervision on non-human-centric tasks. FocusCLIP shows a 2.47% improvement over CLIP in zero-shot bird classification using the CUB dataset. Our findings emphasize the potential of integrating subject-level guidance with general pretraining methods for enhanced downstream performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahe Li, Jiawei Zhang, Xiao Bai, Jin Zheng, Xin Ning, Jun Zhou, Lin Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiance fields have demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views from sparse input views, yet prevailing methods suffer from high training costs and slow inference speed. This paper introduces DNGaussian, a depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields, offering real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting, despite it will encounter a geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance fields, we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint. Consequently, we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed geometry reshaping, we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization, enhancing the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced memory cost, a $25 \times$ reduction in training time, and over $3000 \times$ faster rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wang, Dan Guo, Kun Li, Zhun Zhong, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Motion Magnification (VMM) aims to reveal subtle and imperceptible motion information of objects in the macroscopic world. Prior methods directly model the motion field from the Eulerian perspective by Representation Learning that separates shape and texture or Multi-domain Learning from phase fluctuations. Inspired by the frequency spectrum, we observe that the low-frequency components with stable energy always possess spatial structure and less noise, making them suitable for modeling the subtle motion field. To this end, we present FD4MM, a new paradigm of Frequency Decoupling for Motion Magnification with a Multi-level Isomorphic Architecture to capture multi-level high-frequency details and a stable low-frequency structure (motion field) in video space. Since high-frequency details and subtle motions are susceptible to information degradation due to their inherent subtlety and unavoidable external interference from noise, we carefully design Sparse High/Low-pass Filters to enhance the integrity of details and motion structures, and a Sparse Frequency Mixer to promote seamless recoupling. Besides, we innovatively design a contrastive regularization for this task to strengthen the model's ability to discriminate irrelevant features, reducing undesired motion magnification. Extensive experiments on both Real-world and Synthetic Datasets show that our FD4MM outperforms SOTA methods. Meanwhile, FD4MM reduces FLOPs by 1.63$\times$ and boosts inference speed by 1.68$\times$ than the latest method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jiafei127/FD4MM.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study discusses the critical issues of Virtual Try-On in contemporary e-commerce and the prospective metaverse, emphasizing the challenges of preserving intricate texture details and distinctive features of the target person and the clothes in various scenarios, such as clothing texture and identity characteristics like tattoos or accessories. In addition to the fidelity of the synthesized images, the efficiency of the synthesis process presents a significant hurdle. Various existing approaches are explored, highlighting the limitations and unresolved aspects, e.g., identity information omission, uncontrollable artifacts, and low synthesis speed. It then proposes a novel diffusion-based solution that addresses garment texture preservation and user identity retention during virtual try-on. The proposed network comprises two primary modules - a warping module aligning clothing with individual features and a try-on module refining the attire and generating missing parts integrated with a mask-aware post-processing technique ensuring the integrity of the individual's identity. It demonstrates impressive results, surpassing the state-of-the-art in speed by nearly 20 times during inference, with superior fidelity in qualitative assessments.

<p>Abstract: Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on reconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstruction of hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited to capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of the hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is the first end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texture reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, by three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right) texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2) utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3) the overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and albedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both hands through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor. In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p>Abstract: In the realm of fashion design, sketches serve as the canvas for expressing an artist's distinctive drawing style and creative vision, capturing intricate details like stroke variations and texture nuances. The advent of sketch-to-image cross-modal translation technology has notably aided designers. However, existing methods often compromise these sketch details during image generation, resulting in images that deviate from the designer's intended concept. This limitation hampers the ability to offer designers a precise preview of the final output. To overcome this challenge, we introduce HAIFIT, a novel approach that transforms sketches into high-fidelity, lifelike clothing images by integrating multi-scale features and capturing extensive feature map dependencies from diverse perspectives. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on our self-collected dataset, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in generating photorealistic clothing images. Our method excels in preserving the distinctive style and intricate details essential for fashion design applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linwei Chen, Lin Gu, Ying Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in semantic segmentation, where and what pixels are hard to segment remains largely unexplored. Existing research only separates an image into easy and hard regions and empirically observes the latter are associated with object boundaries. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three types: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings reveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is distortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier domain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for aliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the Nyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing. Then, we introduce the aliasing score as a metric to quantify the extent of aliasing. While positively correlated with the proposed aliasing score, three types of hard pixels exhibit different patterns. Here, we propose two novel de-aliasing filter (DAF) and frequency mixing (FreqMix) modules to alleviate aliasing degradation by accurately removing or adjusting frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency. The DAF precisely removes the frequencies responsible for aliasing before downsampling, while the FreqMix dynamically selects high-frequency components within the encoder block. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic segmentation and low-light instance segmentation tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/Seg-Aliasing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uriel Singer, Amit Zohar, Yuval Kirstain, Shelly Sheynin, Adam Polyak, Devi Parikh, Yaniv Taigman</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Emu Video Edit (EVE), a model that establishes a new state-of-the art in video editing without relying on any supervised video editing data. To develop EVE we separately train an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter, and attach both to the same text-to-image model. Then, to align the adapters towards video editing we introduce a new unsupervised distillation procedure, Factorized Diffusion Distillation. This procedure distills knowledge from one or more teachers simultaneously, without any supervised data. We utilize this procedure to teach EVE to edit videos by jointly distilling knowledge to (i) precisely edit each individual frame from the image editing adapter, and (ii) ensure temporal consistency among the edited frames using the video generation adapter. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of our approach in unlocking other capabilities, we align additional combinations of adapters</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitian Zhang, Yue Bai, Huan Wang, Yizhou Wang, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current training pipelines in object recognition neglect Hue Jittering when doing data augmentation as it not only brings appearance changes that are detrimental to classification, but also the implementation is inefficient in practice. In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Shan, Yujie Zhang, Qi Yang, Haichen Yang, Yiling Xu, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Xiaozhong Xu, Shan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without available reference, which have achieved tremendous improvements due to the utilization of deep neural networks. However, learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of generalization. To solve the problem, we propose a novel contrastive pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA), which enables the pre-trained model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain anchors in the representation space, we project point clouds with different distortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed images with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors, we constrain the pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the philosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and distortion. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, we propose a semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features of projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks. Further investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing learning-based PCQA models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Xu, Ziao Liu, Mengqi Guo, Jiancheng Li, Gim Hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel rolling shutter bundle adjustment method for neural radiance fields (NeRF), which utilizes the unordered rolling shutter (RS) images to obtain the implicit 3D representation. Existing NeRF methods suffer from low-quality images and inaccurate initial camera poses due to the RS effect in the image, whereas, the previous method that incorporates the RS into NeRF requires strict sequential data input, limiting its widespread applicability. In constant, our method recovers the physical formation of RS images by estimating camera poses and velocities, thereby removing the input constraints on sequential data. Moreover, we adopt a coarse-to-fine training strategy, in which the RS epipolar constraints of the pairwise frames in the scene graph are used to detect the camera poses that fall into local minima. The poses detected as outliers are corrected by the interpolation method with neighboring poses. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art works and demonstrate that the reconstruction of 3D representations is not constrained by the requirement of video sequence input.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce LightIt, a method for explicit illumination control for image generation. Recent generative methods lack lighting control, which is crucial to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with single bounce shading, which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs. Then, we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting control in numerous scenes. Additionally, we use our generated dataset to train an identity-preserving relighting model, conditioned on an image and a target shading. Our method is the first that enables the generation of images with controllable, consistent lighting and performs on par with specialized relighting state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rao Fu, Jingyu Liu, Xilun Chen, Yixin Nie, Wenhan Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Scene-LLM, a 3D-visual-language model that enhances embodied agents' abilities in interactive 3D indoor environments by integrating the reasoning strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs). Scene-LLM adopts a hybrid 3D visual feature representation, that incorporates dense spatial information and supports scene state updates. The model employs a projection layer to efficiently project these features in the pre-trained textual embedding space, enabling effective interpretation of 3D visual information. Unique to our approach is the integration of both scene-level and ego-centric 3D information. This combination is pivotal for interactive planning, where scene-level data supports global planning and ego-centric data is important for localization. Notably, we use ego-centric 3D frame features for feature alignment, an efficient technique that enhances the model's ability to align features of small objects within the scene. Our experiments with Scene-LLM demonstrate its strong capabilities in dense captioning, question answering, and interactive planning. We believe Scene-LLM advances the field of 3D visual understanding and reasoning, offering new possibilities for sophisticated agent interactions in indoor settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Datao Tang, Xiangyong Cao, Xingsong Hou, Zhongyuan Jiang, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models has revolutionized the field of image generation, providing new methods for creating high-quality, high-resolution images across various applications. However, the potential of these models for generating domain-specific images, particularly remote sensing (RS) images, remains largely untapped. RS images that are notable for their high resolution, extensive coverage, and rich information content, bring new challenges that general diffusion models may not adequately address. This paper proposes CRS-Diff, a pioneering diffusion modeling framework specifically tailored for generating remote sensing imagery, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models while integrating advanced control mechanisms to ensure that the imagery is not only visually clear but also enriched with geographic and temporal information. The model integrates global and local control inputs, enabling precise combinations of generation conditions to refine the generation process. A comprehensive evaluation of CRS-Diff has demonstrated its superior capability to generate RS imagery both in a single condition and multiple conditions compared with previous methods in terms of image quality and diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing object localization methods are tailored to locate a specific class of objects, relying on abundant labeled data for model optimization. However, in numerous real-world scenarios, acquiring large labeled data can be arduous, significantly constraining the broader application of localization models. To bridge this research gap, this paper proposes the novel task of Few-Shot Object Localization (FSOL), which seeks to achieve precise localization with limited samples available. This task achieves generalized object localization by leveraging a small number of labeled support samples to query the positional information of objects within corresponding images. To advance this research field, we propose an innovative high-performance baseline model. Our model integrates a dual-path feature augmentation module to enhance shape association and gradient differences between supports and query images, alongside a self query module designed to explore the association between feature maps and query images. Experimental results demonstrate a significant performance improvement of our approach in the FSOL task, establishing an efficient benchmark for further research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Zhu, Yang Sun, Bing Cao, Qinghua Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: General image fusion aims at integrating important information from multi-source images. However, due to the significant cross-task gap, the respective fusion mechanism varies considerably in practice, resulting in limited performance across subtasks. To handle this problem, we propose a novel task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) for general image fusion, adaptively prompting various fusion tasks in a unified model. We borrow the insight from the mixture of experts (MoE), taking the experts as efficient tuning adapters to prompt a pre-trained foundation model. These adapters are shared across different tasks and constrained by mutual information regularization, ensuring compatibility with different tasks while complementarity for multi-source images. The task-specific routing networks customize these adapters to extract task-specific information from different sources with dynamic dominant intensity, performing adaptive visual feature prompt fusion. Notably, our TC-MoA controls the dominant intensity bias for different fusion tasks, successfully unifying multiple fusion tasks in a single model. Extensive experiments show that TC-MoA outperforms the competing approaches in learning commonalities while retaining compatibility for general image fusion (multi-modal, multi-exposure, and multi-focus), and also demonstrating striking controllability on more generalization experiments.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation. Despite their progress, challenges remain in both prompt-following ability, image quality and lack of high-quality datasets, which are essential for refining these models. As acquiring labeled data is costly, we introduce AGFSync, a framework that enhances T2I diffusion models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in a fully AI-driven approach. AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven loop. By applying AGFSync to leading T2I models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable improvements in VQA scores, aesthetic evaluations, and performance on the HPSv2 benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of refining T2I diffusion models paves the way for scalable alignment techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved innovative advancements in various fields, including the analysis of human emotions and behaviors. Initiatives such as the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition have been particularly instrumental in driving research in this area by providing diverse and challenging datasets that enable precise evaluation of complex emotional states. This study leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transformer models to focus on the estimation of Valence-Arousal (VA), which signifies the positivity and intensity of emotions, recognition of various facial expressions, and detection of Action Units (AU) representing fundamental muscle movements. This approach transcends traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based methods, proposing a new Transformer-based framework that maximizes the understanding of temporal and spatial features. The core contributions of this research include the introduction of a learning technique through random frame masking and the application of Focal loss adapted for imbalanced data, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of emotion and behavior analysis in real-world settings. This approach is expected to contribute to the advancement of emotional computing and deep learning methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hee Suk Yoon, Eunseop Yoon, Joshua Tian Jin Tee, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, Yingzhen Li, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, test-time adaptation has gained attention as a method for model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning without needing labeled data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Xu, Ya Gao, Xiaorong Qiu, Yang Chen, Ying Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the issues of MixUp and its variants (e.g., Manifold MixUp) in image classification tasks-namely, their neglect of mixing within the same class (intra-class mixup) and their inadequacy in enhancing intra-class cohesion through their mixing operations-we propose a novel mixup method named SynerMix-Intra and, building upon this, introduce a synergistic mixup solution named SynerMix. SynerMix-Intra specifically targets intra-class mixup to bolster intra-class cohesion, a feature not addressed by current mixup methods. For each mini-batch, it leverages feature representations of unaugmented original images from each class to generate a synthesized feature representation through random linear interpolation. All synthesized representations are then fed into the classification and loss layers to calculate an average classification loss that significantly enhances intra-class cohesion. Furthermore, SynerMix combines SynerMix-Intra with an existing mixup approach (e.g., MixUp, Manifold MixUp), which primarily focuses on inter-class mixup and has the benefit of enhancing inter-class separability. In doing so, it integrates both inter- and intra-class mixup in a balanced way while concurrently improving intra-class cohesion and inter-class separability. Experimental results on six datasets show that SynerMix achieves a 0.1% to 3.43% higher accuracy than the best of either MixUp or SynerMix-Intra alone, averaging a 1.16% gain. It also surpasses the top-performer of either Manifold MixUp or SynerMix-Intra by 0.12% to 5.16%, with an average gain of 1.11%. Given that SynerMix is model-agnostic, it holds significant potential for application in other domains where mixup methods have shown promise, such as speech and text classification.

<p>Abstract: We introduce HARPER, a novel dataset for 3D body pose estimation and forecast in dyadic interactions between users and Spot, the quadruped robot manufactured by Boston Dynamics. The key-novelty is the focus on the robot's perspective, i.e., on the data captured by the robot's sensors. These make 3D body pose analysis challenging because being close to the ground captures humans only partially. The scenario underlying HARPER includes 15 actions, of which 10 involve physical contact between the robot and users. The Corpus contains not only the recordings of the built-in stereo cameras of Spot, but also those of a 6-camera OptiTrack system (all recordings are synchronized). This leads to ground-truth skeletal representations with a precision lower than a millimeter. In addition, the Corpus includes reproducible benchmarks on 3D Human Pose Estimation, Human Pose Forecasting, and Collision Prediction, all based on publicly available baseline approaches. This enables future HARPER users to rigorously compare their results with those we provide in this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Mahmood, Ashmal Vayani, Muzammal Naseer, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as reasoning modules that can deconstruct complex tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, particularly when applied to visual reasoning tasks for images. In contrast, this paper introduces a Video Understanding and Reasoning Framework (VURF) based on the reasoning power of LLMs. Ours is a novel approach to extend the utility of LLMs in the context of video tasks, leveraging their capacity to generalize from minimal input and output demonstrations within a contextual framework. By presenting LLMs with pairs of instructions and their corresponding high-level programs, we harness their contextual learning capabilities to generate executable visual programs for video understanding. To enhance program's accuracy and robustness, we implement two important strategies. Firstly, we employ a feedback-generation approach, powered by GPT-3.5, to rectify errors in programs utilizing unsupported functions. Secondly, taking motivation from recent works on self refinement of LLM outputs, we introduce an iterative procedure for improving the quality of the in-context examples by aligning the initial outputs to the outputs that would have been generated had the LLM not been bound by the structure of the in-context examples. Our results on several video-specific tasks, including visual QA, video anticipation, pose estimation and multi-video QA illustrate the efficacy of these enhancements in improving the performance of visual programming approaches for video tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fashion illustration is a crucial medium for designers to convey their creative vision and transform design concepts into tangible representations that showcase the interplay between clothing and the human body. In the context of fashion design, computer vision techniques have the potential to enhance and streamline the design process. Departing from prior research primarily focused on virtual try-on, this paper tackles the task of multimodal-conditioned fashion image editing. Our approach aims to generate human-centric fashion images guided by multimodal prompts, including text, human body poses, garment sketches, and fabric textures. To address this problem, we propose extending latent diffusion models to incorporate these multiple modalities and modifying the structure of the denoising network, taking multimodal prompts as input. To condition the proposed architecture on fabric textures, we employ textual inversion techniques and let diverse cross-attention layers of the denoising network attend to textual and texture information, thus incorporating different granularity conditioning details. Given the lack of datasets for the task, we extend two existing fashion datasets, Dress Code and VITON-HD, with multimodal annotations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of realism and coherence concerning the provided multimodal inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> El Hadji S. Diop, Thierno Fall, Alioune Mbengue, Mohamed Daoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Content and image generation consist in creating or generating data from noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features; and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE) for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs. GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Kaiser, Maximilian Schier, Bodo Rosenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics, current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency. To address this issue, we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for neural tracking-by-regression frameworks and incorporate it into our novel extended Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture tracker. Our uncertainty estimation identifies uncertain associations within high-performing tracking-by-regression methods using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Leveraging this uncertainty, along with a novel mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation, our tracker resolves false associations and mitosis detections stemming from long-term conflicts. We evaluate our approach on nine competitive datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art on biologically relevant metrics substantially, achieving improvements by a factor of approximately $5.75$. Furthermore, we uncover new insights into the behavior of tracking-by-regression uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bumsoo Kim, Wonseop Shin, Kyuchul Lee, Sanghyun Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common approach for generating training data in various generative fields. However, visual hallucinations, which contain perceptually critical defects, remain a concern, especially in non-photorealistic styles like cartoon characters. We propose a novel visual hallucination detection system for cartoon character images generated by TTI models. Our approach leverages pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing both RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance from a fine-tuned pose estimator, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. This research advances TTI models by mitigating visual hallucinations, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghua Zhai, Chen Ju, Jinsong Lan, Shuai Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Cell Variational Information Bottleneck Network (cellVIB), a convolutional neural network using information bottleneck mechanism, which can be combined with the latest feedforward network architecture in an end-to-end training method. Our Cell Variational Information Bottleneck Network is constructed by stacking VIB cells, which generate feature maps with uncertainty. As layers going deeper, the regularization effect will gradually increase, instead of directly adding excessive regular constraints to the output layer of the model as in Deep VIB. Under each VIB cell, the feedforward process learns an independent mean term and an standard deviation term, and predicts the Gaussian distribution based on them. The feedback process is based on reparameterization trick for effective training. This work performs an extensive analysis on MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of each VIB cells, and provides an insightful analysis on how the VIB cells affect mutual information. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 also prove that our cellVIB is robust against noisy labels during training and against corrupted images during testing. Then, we validate our method on PACS dataset, whose results show that the VIB cells can significantly improve the generalization performance of the basic model. Finally, in a more complex representation learning task, face recognition, our network structure has also achieved very competitive results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhi Gao, Zheng Chen, Zehui Chen, Lin Chen, Jiaming Liu, Shanghang Zhang, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Training high-accuracy 3D detectors necessitates massive labeled 3D annotations with 7 degree-of-freedom, which is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, the form of point annotations is proposed to offer significant prospects for practical applications in 3D detection, which is not only more accessible and less expensive but also provides strong spatial information for object localization. In this paper, we empirically discover that it is non-trivial to merely adapt Point-DETR to its 3D form, encountering two main bottlenecks: 1) it fails to encode strong 3D prior into the model, and 2) it generates low-quality pseudo labels in distant regions due to the extreme sparsity of LiDAR points. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Point-DETR3D, a teacher-student framework for weakly semi-supervised 3D detection, designed to fully capitalize on point-wise supervision within a constrained instance-wise annotation budget.Different from Point-DETR which encodes 3D positional information solely through a point encoder, we propose an explicit positional query initialization strategy to enhance the positional prior. Considering the low quality of pseudo labels at distant regions produced by the teacher model, we enhance the detector's perception by incorporating dense imagery data through a novel Cross-Modal Deformable RoI Fusion (D-RoI).Moreover, an innovative point-guided self-supervised learning technique is proposed to allow for fully exploiting point priors, even in student models.Extensive experiments on representative nuScenes dataset demonstrate our Point-DETR3D obtains significant improvements compared to previous works. Notably, with only 5% of labeled data, Point-DETR3D achieves over 90% performance of its fully supervised counterpart.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aziliz Guezou-Philippe, Arnaud Clav\'e, Ehouarn Maguet, Ludivine Maintier, Charles Garraud, Jean-Rassaire Fouefack, Val\'erie Burdin, Eric Stindel, Guillaume Dardenne</p>
<p>Abstract: Arthroplasty is commonly performed to treat joint osteoarthritis, reducing pain and improving mobility. While arthroplasty has known several technical improvements, a significant share of patients are still unsatisfied with their surgery. Personalised arthroplasty improves surgical outcomes however current solutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine. We propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants, presented for total knee arthroplasty, the most widely performed arthroplasty in the world nowadays.
  The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the proximal and distal extremities of the femur and tibia. Then the full bones are reconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and landmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to design patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using 91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in terms of accuracy and execution time.
  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\pm0.4mm$ for the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical landmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with $0.6\pm0.2mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design lasted about 5 minutes.
  The proposed workflow allows for a fast and reliable personalisation of knee implants, directly from the patient CT image without requiring any manual intervention. It establishes a patient-specific pre-operative planning for TKA in a very short time making it easily available for all patients. Combined with efficient implant manufacturing techniques, this solution could help answer the growing number of arthroplasties while reducing complications and improving the patients' satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Mu Cai, Bingxin Xu, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically use a fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 18 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neehar Kondapaneni, Pietro Perona</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to understand and manipulate numbers and quantities emerges during childhood, but the mechanism through which humans acquire and develop this ability is still poorly understood. We explore this question through a model, assuming that the learner is able to pick up and place small objects from, and to, locations of its choosing, and will spontaneously engage in such undirected manipulation. We further assume that the learner's visual system will monitor the changing arrangements of objects in the scene and will learn to predict the effects of each action by comparing perception with a supervisory signal from the motor system. We model perception using standard deep networks for feature extraction and classification, and gradient descent learning. Our main finding is that, from learning the task of action prediction, an unexpected image representation emerges exhibiting regularities that foreshadow the perception and representation of numbers and quantity. These include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a strict ordering of the numbers, and a one-dimensional signal that correlates with numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to estimate numerosity, i.e. the number of objects in the scene, as well as subitization, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of objects in small scenes. Remarkably, subitization and numerosity estimation extrapolate to scenes containing many objects, far beyond the three objects used during training. We conclude that important aspects of a facility with numbers and quantities may be learned with supervision from a simple pre-training task. Our observations suggest that cross-modal learning is a powerful learning mechanism that may be harnessed in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingge Wang, Liyan Xie, Yao Xie, Shao-Lun Huang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization aims at learning a universal model that performs well on unseen target domains, incorporating knowledge from multiple source domains. In this research, we consider the scenario where different domain shifts occur among conditional distributions of different classes across domains. When labeled samples in the source domains are limited, existing approaches are not sufficiently robust. To address this problem, we propose a novel domain generalization framework called {Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Domain Generalization} (WDRDG), inspired by the concept of distributionally robust optimization. We encourage robustness over conditional distributions within class-specific Wasserstein uncertainty sets and optimize the worst-case performance of a classifier over these uncertainty sets. We further develop a test-time adaptation module leveraging optimal transport to quantify the relationship between the unseen target domain and source domains to make adaptive inference for target data. Experiments on the Rotated MNIST, PACS and the VLCS datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively balance the robustness and discriminability in challenging generalization scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Li, Qiongxiu Li, Zhanhao Hu, Xiaolin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning poses severe privacy concerns as it has been shown that the learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many works have investigated the effect of widely adopted data augmentation and adversarial training techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem, we deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization degrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several findings about the connections between three essential properties of machine learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are less correlated than those of the previous results. Moreover, there is not necessarily a trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy as stronger adversarial robustness does not make the model more susceptible to privacy attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Li, Fenghua Xie, Hang Chen, Kexin Yuan, Xiaolin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual approaches involving visual inputs have laid the foundation for recent progress in speech separation. However, the optimization of the concurrent usage of auditory and visual inputs is still an active research area. Inspired by the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit, in which the sensory processing mechanisms of different modalities modulate one another via the non-lemniscal sensory thalamus, we propose a novel cortico-thalamo-cortical neural network (CTCNet) for audio-visual speech separation (AVSS). First, the CTCNet learns hierarchical auditory and visual representations in a bottom-up manner in separate auditory and visual subnetworks, mimicking the functions of the auditory and visual cortical areas. Then, inspired by the large number of connections between cortical regions and the thalamus, the model fuses the auditory and visual information in a thalamic subnetwork through top-down connections. Finally, the model transmits this fused information back to the auditory and visual subnetworks, and the above process is repeated several times. The results of experiments on three speech separation benchmark datasets show that CTCNet remarkably outperforms existing AVSS methods with considerably fewer parameters. These results suggest that mimicking the anatomical connectome of the mammalian brain has great potential for advancing the development of deep neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David D. Nguyen, David Leibowitz, Surya Nepal, Salil S. Kanhere</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models with discrete latent representations have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to learn complex high-dimensional data distributions. However, their performance relies on a long sequence of tokens per instance and a large number of codebook entries, resulting in long sampling times and considerable computation to fit the categorical posterior. To address these issues, we propose the Masked Vector Quantization (MVQ) framework which increases the representational capacity of each code vector by learning mask configurations via a stochastic winner-takes-all training regime called Multiple Hypothese Dropout (MH-Dropout). On ImageNet 64$\times$64, MVQ reduces FID in existing vector quantization architectures by up to $68\%$ at 2 tokens per instance and $57\%$ at 5 tokens. These improvements widen as codebook entries is reduced and allows for $7\textit{--}45\times$ speed-up in token sampling during inference. As an additional benefit, we find that smaller latent spaces lead to MVQ identifying transferable visual representations where multiple can be smoothly combined.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain a wealth of biomedical information, serving as valuable resources for the development of precision medicine systems. However, privacy concerns have resulted in limited access to high-quality and large-scale EHR data for researchers, impeding progress in methodological development. Recent research has delved into synthesizing realistic EHR data through generative modeling techniques, where a majority of proposed methods relied on generative adversarial networks (GAN) and their variants for EHR synthesis. Despite GAN-based methods attaining state-of-the-art performance in generating EHR data, these approaches are difficult to train and prone to mode collapse. Recently introduced in generative modeling, diffusion models have established cutting-edge performance in image generation, but their efficacy in EHR data synthesis remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the potential of diffusion models for EHR data synthesis and introduce a novel method, EHRDiff. Through extensive experiments, EHRDiff establishes new state-of-the-art quality for synthetic EHR data, protecting private information in the meanwhile.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Xu, Yazhou Ren, Xiaolong Wang, Lei Feng, Zheng Zhang, Gang Niu, Xiaofeng Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims at exploring category structures among multi-view data in self-supervised manners. Multiple views provide more information than single views and thus existing MVC methods can achieve satisfactory performance. However, their performance might seriously degenerate when the views are noisy in practical multi-view scenarios. In this paper, we formally investigate the drawback of noisy views and then propose a theoretically grounded deep MVC method (namely MVCAN) to address this issue. Specifically, we propose a novel MVC objective that enables un-shared parameters and inconsistent clustering predictions across multiple views to reduce the side effects of noisy views. Furthermore, a two-level multi-view iterative optimization is designed to generate robust learning targets for refining individual views' representation learning. Theoretical analysis reveals that MVCAN works by achieving the multi-view consistency, complementarity, and noise robustness. Finally, experiments on extensive public datasets demonstrate that MVCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is robust against the existence of noisy views.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of digital avatars has raised an exponential increase in the demand for human point clouds with realistic and intricate details. The compression of such data becomes challenging with overwhelming data amounts comprising millions of points. Herein, we leverage the human geometric prior in geometry redundancy removal of point clouds, greatly promoting the compression performance. More specifically, the prior provides topological constraints as geometry initialization, allowing adaptive adjustments with a compact parameter set that could be represented with only a few bits. Therefore, we can envisage high-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and structural deviations. The priors could first be derived with an aligned point cloud, and subsequently the difference of features is compressed into a compact latent code. The proposed framework can operate in a play-and-plug fashion with existing learning based point cloud compression methods. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the compression performance without deteriorating the quality, demonstrating its promise in a variety of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yu, Xingxuan Zhang, Renzhe Xu, Jiashuo Liu, Yue He, Peng Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization aims to solve the challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization by leveraging common knowledge learned from multiple training domains to generalize to unseen test domains. To accurately evaluate the OOD generalization ability, it is required that test data information is unavailable. However, the current domain generalization protocol may still have potential test data information leakage. This paper examines the risks of test data information leakage from two aspects of the current evaluation protocol: supervised pretraining on ImageNet and oracle model selection. We propose modifications to the current protocol that we should employ self-supervised pretraining or train from scratch instead of employing the current supervised pretraining, and we should use multiple test domains. These would result in a more precise evaluation of OOD generalization ability. We also rerun the algorithms with the modified protocol and introduce new leaderboards to encourage future research in domain generalization with a fairer comparison.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of deep learning has brought a revolutionary transformation to image denoising techniques. However, the persistent challenge of acquiring noise-clean pairs for supervised methods in real-world scenarios remains formidable, necessitating the exploration of more practical self-supervised image denoising. This paper focuses on self-supervised image denoising methods that offer effective solutions to address this challenge. Our comprehensive review thoroughly analyzes the latest advancements in self-supervised image denoising approaches, categorizing them into three distinct classes: General methods, Blind Spot Network (BSN)-based methods, and Transformer-based methods. For each class, we provide a concise theoretical analysis along with their practical applications. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we present both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various datasets, utilizing classical algorithms as benchmarks. Additionally, we critically discuss the current limitations of these methods and propose promising directions for future research. By offering a detailed overview of recent developments in self-supervised image denoising, this review serves as an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, facilitating a deeper understanding of this emerging domain and inspiring further advancements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have extended the spectrum of Web of Things for intelligent vehicles and have become an important component of the Web ecosystem. Similar to traditional Web-based applications, fairness is an essential aspect for ensuring the high quality of autonomous driving systems, particularly in the context of pedestrian detectors within them. However, there is an absence in the literature of a comprehensive assessment of the fairness of current Deep Learning (DL)-based pedestrian detectors. To fill the gap, we evaluate eight widely-explored DL-based pedestrian detectors across demographic groups on large-scale real-world datasets. To enable a thorough fairness evaluation, we provide extensive annotations for the datasets, resulting in 8,311 images with 16,070 gender labels, 20,115 age labels, and 3,513 skin tone labels. Our findings reveal significant fairness issues related to age. The undetected proportions for adults are 20.14% lower compared to children. Furthermore, we explore how various driving scenarios affect the fairness of pedestrian detectors. We find that the bias may exacerbate for children and females towards low brightness and low contrast.</p>

<p>Abstract: Undoubtedly breast cancer identifies itself as one of the most widespread and terrifying cancers across the globe. Millions of women are getting affected each year from it. Breast cancer remains the major one for being the reason of largest number of demise of women. In the recent time of research, Medical Image Computing and Processing has been playing a significant role for detecting and classifying breast cancers from ultrasound images and mammograms, along with the celestial touch of deep neural networks. In this research, we focused mostly on our rigorous implementations and iterative result analysis of different cutting-edge modified versions of EfficientNet architectures namely EfficientNet-V1 (b0-b7) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0-b3) with ultrasound image, named as CEIMVEN. We utilized transfer learning approach here for using the pre-trained models of EfficientNet versions. We activated the hyper-parameter tuning procedures, added fully connected layers, discarded the unprecedented outliers and recorded the accuracy results from our custom modified EfficientNet architectures. Our deep learning model training approach was related to both identifying the cancer affected areas with region of interest (ROI) techniques and multiple classifications (benign, malignant and normal). The approximate testing accuracies we got from the modified versions of EfficientNet-V1 (b0- 99.15%, b1- 98.58%, b2- 98.43%, b3- 98.01%, b4- 98.86%, b5- 97.72%, b6- 97.72%, b7- 98.72%) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0- 99.29%, b1- 99.01%, b2- 98.72%, b3- 99.43%) are showing very bright future and strong potentials of deep learning approach for the successful detection and classification of breast cancers from the ultrasound images at a very early stage.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with its exceptional quality and creativity. However, its multi-step sampling process is known to be slow, often requiring tens of inference steps to obtain satisfactory results. Previous attempts to improve its sampling speed and reduce computational costs through distillation have been unsuccessful in achieving a functional one-step model. In this paper, we explore a recent method called Rectified Flow, which, thus far, has only been applied to small datasets. The core of Rectified Flow lies in its \emph{reflow} procedure, which straightens the trajectories of probability flows, refines the coupling between noises and images, and facilitates the distillation process with student models. We propose a novel text-conditioned pipeline to turn Stable Diffusion (SD) into an ultra-fast one-step model, in which we find reflow plays a critical role in improving the assignment between noise and images. Leveraging our new pipeline, we create, to the best of our knowledge, the first one-step diffusion-based text-to-image generator with SD-level image quality, achieving an FID (Frechet Inception Distance) of $23.3$ on MS COCO 2017-5k, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art technique, progressive distillation, by a significant margin ($37.2$ $\rightarrow$ $23.3$ in FID). By utilizing an expanded network with 1.7B parameters, we further improve the FID to $22.4$. We call our one-step models \emph{InstaFlow}. On MS COCO 2014-30k, InstaFlow yields an FID of $13.1$ in just $0.09$ second, the best in $\leq 0.1$ second regime, outperforming the recent StyleGAN-T ($13.9$ in $0.1$ second). Notably, the training of InstaFlow only costs 199 A100 GPU days. Codes and pre-trained models are available at \url{github.com/gnobitab/InstaFlow}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyao Zhai, Xiaoni Cai, Dianye Huang, Yan Di, Fabian Manhardt, Federico Tombari, Nassir Navab, Benjamin Busam</p>
<p>Abstract: Object rearrangement is pivotal in robotic-environment interactions, representing a significant capability in embodied AI. In this paper, we present SG-Bot, a novel rearrangement framework that utilizes a coarse-to-fine scheme with a scene graph as the scene representation. Unlike previous methods that rely on either known goal priors or zero-shot large models, SG-Bot exemplifies lightweight, real-time, and user-controllable characteristics, seamlessly blending the consideration of commonsense knowledge with automatic generation capabilities. SG-Bot employs a three-fold procedure--observation, imagination, and execution--to adeptly address the task. Initially, objects are discerned and extracted from a cluttered scene during the observation. These objects are first coarsely organized and depicted within a scene graph, guided by either commonsense or user-defined criteria. Then, this scene graph subsequently informs a generative model, which forms a fine-grained goal scene considering the shape information from the initial scene and object semantics. Finally, for execution, the initial and envisioned goal scenes are matched to formulate robotic action policies. Experimental results demonstrate that SG-Bot outperforms competitors by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Baharoon, Hessa Almatar, Reema Alduhayan, Tariq Aldebasi, Badr Alahmadi, Yahya Bokhari, Mohammed Alawad, Ahmed Almazroa, Abdulrhman Aljouie</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown promise in predicting hypertension (HTN) from fundus images. However, most prior research has primarily focused on analyzing a single type of data, which may not capture the full complexity of HTN risk. To address this limitation, this study introduces a multimodal deep learning (MMDL) system, dubbed HyMNet, which combines fundus images and cardiometabolic risk factors, specifically age and gender, to improve hypertension detection capabilities. Our MMDL system uses RETFound, a foundation model pre-trained on 1.6 million retinal images, for the fundus path and a fully connected neural network for the age and gender path. The two paths are jointly trained by concatenating the feature vectors from each path that are then fed into a fusion network. The system was trained on 5,016 retinal images from 1,243 individuals collected from the Saudi Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs. The results show that the multimodal model that integrates fundus images along with age and gender outperforms the unimodal system trained solely on fundus photographs, with an F1 score of 0.771 [0.747, 0.796], and 0.745 [0.719, 0.772] for hypertension detection, respectively. Additionally, we studied the effect underlying diabetes mellitus has on the model's predictive ability, concluding that diabetes is used as a confounding variable for distinguishing hypertensive cases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Yuan, Dongfang Zhao, Sos S. Agaian</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin cancer is a significant public health problem, and computer-aided diagnosis can help to prevent and treat it. A crucial step for computer-aided diagnosis is accurately segmenting skin lesions in images, which allows for lesion detection, classification, and analysis. However, this task is challenging due to the diverse characteristics of lesions, such as appearance, shape, size, color, texture, and location, as well as image quality issues like noise, artifacts, and occlusions. Deep learning models have recently been applied to skin lesion segmentation, but they have high parameter counts and computational demands, making them unsuitable for mobile health applications. To address this challenge, we propose UCM-Net, a novel, efficient, and lightweight solution that integrates Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Unlike conventional UNet architectures, our UCMNet-Block reduces parameter overhead and enhances UCM-Net's learning capabilities, leading to robust segmentation performance. We validate UCM-Net's competitiveness through extensive experiments on PH2, isic2017 and isic2018 datasets. Remarkably, UCM-Net has less than 50KB parameters and less than 0.05 Giga-Operations Per Second (GLOPs), setting a new possible standard for efficiency in skin lesion segmentation. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Cai, Jiahao Wang, Alan Yuille, Zongwei Zhou, Angtian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: X-ray, known for its ability to reveal internal structures of objects, is expected to provide richer information for 3D reconstruction than visible light. Yet, existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) algorithms overlook this important nature of X-ray, leading to their limitations in capturing structural contents of imaged objects. In this paper, we propose a framework, Structure-Aware X-ray Neural Radiodensity Fields (SAX-NeRF), for sparse-view X-ray 3D reconstruction. Firstly, we design a Line Segment-based Transformer (Lineformer) as the backbone of SAX-NeRF. Linefomer captures internal structures of objects in 3D space by modeling the dependencies within each line segment of an X-ray. Secondly, we present a Masked Local-Global (MLG) ray sampling strategy to extract contextual and geometric information in 2D projection. Plus, we collect a larger-scale dataset X3D covering wider X-ray applications. Experiments on X3D show that SAX-NeRF surpasses previous NeRF-based methods by 12.56 and 2.49 dB on novel view synthesis and CT reconstruction.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13231">Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yang, Jian Tao, Jiafei Lyu, Chunjiang Ge, Jiaxin Chen, Qimai Li, Weihan Shen, Xiaolong Zhu, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yk7333/D3PO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhyun Shin, Seokjun Choi, Felix Heide, Seung-Hwan Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral 3D imaging aims to acquire both depth and spectral information of a scene. However, existing methods are either prohibitively expensive and bulky or compromise on spectral and depth accuracy. In this work, we present Dispersed Structured Light (DSL), a cost-effective and compact method for accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL modifies a traditional projector-camera system by placing a sub-millimeter thick diffraction grating film front of the projector. The grating disperses structured light based on light wavelength. To utilize the dispersed structured light, we devise a model for dispersive projection image formation and a per-pixel hyperspectral 3D reconstruction method. We validate DSL by instantiating a compact experimental prototype. DSL achieves spectral accuracy of 18.8nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and depth error of 1mm. We demonstrate that DSL outperforms prior work on practical hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL promises accurate and practical hyperspectral 3D imaging for diverse application domains, including computer vision and graphics, cultural heritage, geology, and biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqian Li, Kewen Wu, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current evaluation protocols predominantly assess physical reasoning in stationary scenes, creating a gap in evaluating agents' abilities to interact with dynamic events. While contemporary methods allow agents to modify initial scene configurations and observe consequences, they lack the capability to interact with events in real time. To address this, we introduce I-PHYRE, a framework that challenges agents to simultaneously exhibit intuitive physical reasoning, multi-step planning, and in-situ intervention. Here, intuitive physical reasoning refers to a quick, approximate understanding of physics to address complex problems; multi-step denotes the need for extensive sequence planning in I-PHYRE, considering each intervention can significantly alter subsequent choices; and in-situ implies the necessity for timely object manipulation within a scene, where minor timing deviations can result in task failure. We formulate four game splits to scrutinize agents' learning and generalization of essential principles of interactive physical reasoning, fostering learning through interaction with representative scenarios. Our exploration involves three planning strategies and examines several supervised and reinforcement agents' zero-shot generalization proficiency on I-PHYRE. The outcomes highlight a notable gap between existing learning algorithms and human performance, emphasizing the imperative for more research in enhancing agents with interactive physical reasoning capabilities. The environment and baselines will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03695">A Large-Scale Empirical Study on Improving the Fairness of Image Classification Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Yang, Jiajun Jiang, Zeyu Sun, Junjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness has been a critical issue that affects the adoption of deep learning models in real practice. To improve model fairness, many existing methods have been proposed and evaluated to be effective in their own contexts. However, there is still no systematic evaluation among them for a comprehensive comparison under the same context, which makes it hard to understand the performance distinction among them, hindering the research progress and practical adoption of them. To fill this gap, this paper endeavours to conduct the first large-scale empirical study to comprehensively compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art fairness improving techniques. Specifically, we target the widely-used application scenario of image classification, and utilized three different datasets and five commonly-used performance metrics to assess in total 13 methods from diverse categories. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the performance of each method across different datasets and sensitive attributes, indicating over-fitting on specific datasets by many existing methods. Furthermore, different fairness evaluation metrics, due to their distinct focuses, yield significantly different assessment results. Overall, we observe that pre-processing methods and in-processing methods outperform post-processing methods, with pre-processing methods exhibiting the best performance. Our empirical study offers comprehensive recommendations for enhancing fairness in deep learning models. We approach the problem from multiple dimensions, aiming to provide a uniform evaluation platform and inspire researchers to explore more effective fairness solutions via a set of implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: By consolidating scattered knowledge, the literature review provides a comprehensive understanding of the investigated topic. However, reading, conducting, or peer-reviewing review papers generally demands a significant investment of time and effort from researchers. To improve efficiency, this paper aims to provide a thorough review of reviews in the PAMI field from diverse perspectives. First, this paper proposes several article-level, field-normalized, and large language model-empowered bibliometric indicators to evaluate reviews. To facilitate this, a meta-data database dubbed RiPAMI, and a topic dataset are constructed. Second, based on these indicators, the study presents comparative analyses of representative reviews, unveiling the characteristics of publications across various fields, periods, and journals. The newly emerging AI-generated literature reviews are also appraised, and the observed differences suggest that most AI-generated reviews still lag behind human-authored reviews in multiple aspects. Third, we briefly provide a subjective evaluation of representative PAMI reviews and introduce a paper structure-based typology of literature reviews. This typology may improve the clarity and effectiveness for scholars in reading and writing reviews, while also serving as a guide for AI systems in generating well-organized reviews. Finally, this work offers insights into the current challenges of literature reviews and envisions future directions for their development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Soo Min Kwon, Ismail R. Alkhouri, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput biomedical applications necessitate real-time, large field-of-view (FOV) imaging capabilities. Conventional lens-free imaging (LFI) systems, while addressing the limitations of physical lenses, have been constrained by dynamic, hard-to-model optical fields, resulting in a limited one-shot FOV of approximately 20 $mm^2$. This restriction has been a major bottleneck in applications like live-cell imaging and automation of microfluidic systems for biomedical research. Here, we present a deep-learning(DL)-based imaging framework - GenLFI - leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) for holographic image reconstruction. We demonstrate that GenLFI can achieve a real-time FOV over 550 $mm^2$, surpassing the current LFI system by more than 20-fold, and even larger than the world's largest confocal microscope by 1.76 times. The resolution is at the sub-pixel level of 5.52 $\mu m$, without the need for a shifting light source. The unsupervised learning-based reconstruction does not require optical field modeling, making imaging dynamic 3D samples (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics and 3D cell models) in complex optical fields possible. This GenLFI framework unlocks the potential of LFI systems, offering a robust tool to tackle new frontiers in high-throughput biomedical applications such as drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashesh Ashesh, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we present denoiSplit, a method to tackle a new analysis task, i.e. the challenge of joint semantic image splitting and unsupervised denoising. This dual approach has important applications in fluorescence microscopy, where semantic image splitting has important applications but noise does generally hinder the downstream analysis of image content. Image splitting involves dissecting an image into its distinguishable semantic structures. We show that the current state-of-the-art method for this task struggles in the presence of image noise, inadvertently also distributing the noise across the predicted outputs. The method we present here can deal with image noise by integrating an unsupervised denoising sub-task. This integration results in improved semantic image unmixing, even in the presence of notable and realistic levels of imaging noise. A key innovation in denoiSplit is the use of specifically formulated noise models and the suitable adjustment of KL-divergence loss for the high-dimensional hierarchical latent space we are training. We showcase the performance of denoiSplit across 4 tasks on real-world microscopy images. Additionally, we perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compare results to existing benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of using denoiSplit: a single Variational Splitting Encoder-Decoder (VSE) Network using two suitable noise models to jointly perform semantic splitting and denoising.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis, offering critical insights and aiding in informed decision-making. Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in chart understanding leveraging large foundation models.
