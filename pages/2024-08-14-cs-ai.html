<p><b>Authors:</b> Yen-Che Hsiao, Abhishek Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel in-context learning algorithm for building autonomous decision-making language agents. The language agent continuously attempts to solve the same task by self-correcting each time the task fails. Our selected language agent demonstrates the ability to solve tasks in a text-based game environment. Our results show that the gemma-2-9b-it language model, using our proposed method, can successfully complete two of six tasks that failed in the first attempt. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of a single language model through self-correction, paving the way for more advanced autonomous agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in active inference which has recently gained popularity due to its intuitive decomposition of the expected value of control into a pragmatic and an epistemic component. While numerous conjectures have been made to justify EFE as a decision making objective function, the most widely accepted is still its intuitiveness and resemblance to variational free energy in approximate Bayesian inference. In this work, we take a bottom up approach and ask: taking EFE as given, what's the resulting agent's optimality gap compared with a reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which is well understood? By casting EFE under a particular class of belief MDP and using analysis tools from RL theory, we show that EFE approximates the Bayes optimal RL policy via information value. We discuss the implications for objective specification of active inference agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Ying, Mengting Hu, Jianfeng Wu, Yalan Xie, Xiaoyi Liu, Zhunheng Wang, Ming Jiang, Hang Gao, Linlin Zhang, Renhong Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph completion aims to infer the missing facts in temporal knowledge graphs. Current approaches usually embed factual knowledge into continuous vector space and apply geometric operations to learn potential patterns in temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods only adopt a single operation, which may have limitations in capturing the complex temporal dynamics present in temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, i.e. TCompoundE, which is specially designed with two geometric operations, including time-specific and relation-specific operations. We provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TCompoundE to encode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing temporal knowledge graph embedding models. Our code is available at https://github.com/nk-ruiying/TCompoundE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Pang, Ruixue Duan, Jinfu Yang, Ning Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Dialog (VD) is a task where an agent answers a series of image-related questions based on a multi-round dialog history. However, previous VD methods often treat the entire dialog history as a simple text input, disregarding the inherent conversational information flows at the round level. In this paper, we introduce Multi-round Dialogue State Tracking model (MDST), a framework that addresses this limitation by leveraging the dialogue state learned from dialog history to answer questions. MDST captures each round of dialog history, constructing internal dialogue state representations defined as 2-tuples of vision-language representations. These representations effectively ground the current question, enabling the generation of accurate answers. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset demonstrate that MDST achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in generative setting. Furthermore, through a series of human studies, we validate the effectiveness of MDST in generating long, consistent, and human-like answers while consistently answering a series of questions correctly.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06816">MAQA: Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs Regarding Data Uncertainty</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjin Yang, Haneul Yoo, Hwaran Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are capable of performing various tasks, they still suffer from producing plausible but incorrect responses. To improve the reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification to predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on questions requiring a single clear answer, ignoring the existence of data uncertainty that arises from irreducible randomness. Instead, these methods only consider model uncertainty, which arises from a lack of knowledge. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that entropy and consistency-based methods estimate the model uncertainty well even under data uncertainty, while other methods for white- and black-box LLMs struggle depending on the tasks. Additionally, methods designed for white-box LLMs suffer from overconfidence in reasoning tasks compared to simple knowledge queries. We believe our observations will pave the way for future work on uncertainty quantification in realistic setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronja Fuchs, Robin Gieseke, Alexander Dockhorn</p>
<p>Abstract: Balancing game difficulty in video games is a key task to create interesting gaming experiences for players. Mismatching the game difficulty and a player's skill or commitment results in frustration or boredom on the player's side, and hence reduces time spent playing the game. In this work, we explore balancing game difficulty using machine learning-based agents to challenge players based on their current behavior. This is achieved by a combination of two agents, in which one learns to imitate the player, while the second is trained to beat the first. In our demo, we investigate the proposed framework for personalized dynamic difficulty adjustment of AI agents in the context of the fighting game AI competition.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06849">Causal Agent based on Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairong Han, Kun Kuang, Ziyu Zhao, Junjian Ye, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLMs to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLMs' ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. This lack of causal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tools module, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct framework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for these four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. Our methodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80%. For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/Kairong-Han/Causal_Agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Rago, Maria Vanina Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI models become ever more complex and intertwined in humans' daily lives, greater levels of interactivity of explainable AI (XAI) methods are needed. In this paper, we propose the use of belief change theory as a formal foundation for operators that model the incorporation of new information, i.e. user feedback in interactive XAI, to logical representations of data-driven classifiers. We argue that this type of formalisation provides a framework and a methodology to develop interactive explanations in a principled manner, providing warranted behaviour and favouring transparency and accountability of such interactions. Concretely, we first define a novel, logic-based formalism to represent explanatory information shared between humans and machines. We then consider real world scenarios for interactive XAI, with different prioritisations of new and existing knowledge, where our formalism may be instantiated. Finally, we analyse a core set of belief change postulates, discussing their suitability for our real world settings and pointing to particular challenges that may require the relaxation or reinterpretation of some of the theoretical assumptions underlying existing operators.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06876">Decision-Focused Learning to Predict Action Costs for Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayanta Mandi, Marco Foschini, Daniel Holler, Sylvie Thiebaux, Jorg Hoffmann, Tias Guns</p>
<p>Abstract: In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06891">Automatic Feature Recognition and Dimensional Attributes Extraction From CAD Models for Hybrid Additive-Subtractive Manufacturing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Tayyab Khan, Wenhe Feng, Lequn Chen, Ye Han Ng, Nicholas Yew Jin Tan, Seung Ki Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing, facilitating seamless transitions from digital designs to physical products. However, a significant challenge within this integration is the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the context of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the identification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets, chamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately extracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors for effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel approach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features relevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open Cascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is implemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features within the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the proposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology enhances the integration of CAD, CAPP, and CAM within hybrid manufacturing by providing precise feature recognition and dimension extraction. It facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by enabling more informed decision-making.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06920">Multi-Agent Continuous Control with Generative Flow Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Luo, Yinchuan Li, Shunyu Liu, Xu Zhang, Yunfeng Shao, Chao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) aim to generate diverse trajectories from a distribution in which the final states of the trajectories are proportional to the reward, serving as a powerful alternative to reinforcement learning for exploratory control tasks. However, the individual-flow matching constraint in GFlowNets limits their applications for multi-agent systems, especially continuous joint-control problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent generative Continuous Flow Networks (MACFN) method to enable multiple agents to perform cooperative exploration for various compositional continuous objects. Technically, MACFN trains decentralized individual-flow-based policies in a centralized global-flow-based matching fashion. During centralized training, MACFN introduces a continuous flow decomposition network to deduce the flow contributions of each agent in the presence of only global rewards. Then agents can deliver actions solely based on their assigned local flow in a decentralized way, forming a joint policy distribution proportional to the rewards. To guarantee the expressiveness of continuous flow decomposition, we theoretically derive a consistency condition on the decomposition network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts and better exploration capability.

<p>Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) remains a significant hurdle in optimizing production processes. This challenge involves efficiently allocating jobs to a limited number of machines while minimizing factors like total processing time or job delays. While recent advancements in artificial intelligence have yielded promising solutions, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, this paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for JSSP. We introduce the very first supervised 120k dataset specifically designed to train LLMs for JSSP. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that LLM-based scheduling can achieve performance comparable to other neural approaches. Furthermore, we propose a sampling method that enhances the effectiveness of LLMs in tackling JSSP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Barthet, Diogo Branco, Roberto Gallotta, Ahmed Khalifa, Georgios N. Yannakakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomously tailoring content to a set of predetermined affective patterns has long been considered the holy grail of affect-aware human-computer interaction at large. The experience-driven procedural content generation framework realises this vision by searching for content that elicits a certain experience pattern to a user. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for generating affect-tailored content, and we test it in the domain of racing games. Specifically, the experience-driven RL (EDRL) framework is given a target arousal trace, and it then generates a racetrack that elicits the desired affective responses for a particular type of player. EDRL leverages a reward function that assesses the affective pattern of any generated racetrack from a corpus of arousal traces. Our findings suggest that EDRL can accurately generate affect-driven racing game levels according to a designer's style and outperforms search-based methods for personalised content generation. The method is not only directly applicable to game content generation tasks but also employable broadly to any domain that uses content for affective adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Fiori, Gabriele Civitarese, Claudio Bettini</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing daily activities with unobtrusive sensors in smart environments enables various healthcare applications. Monitoring how subjects perform activities at home and their changes over time can reveal early symptoms of health issues, such as cognitive decline. Most approaches in this field use deep learning models, which are often seen as black boxes mapping sensor data to activities. However, non-expert users like clinicians need to trust and understand these models' outputs. Thus, eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for Human Activity Recognition have emerged to provide intuitive natural language explanations from these models. Different XAI methods generate different explanations, and their effectiveness is typically evaluated through user surveys, that are often challenging in terms of costs and fairness. This paper proposes an automatic evaluation method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify, in a pool of candidates, the best XAI approach for non-expert users. Our preliminary results suggest that LLM evaluation aligns with user surveys.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Cheng, Taiyuan Mei, Yun Zi, Qi Wang, Zijun Gao, Haowei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero sample learning is an effective method for data deficiency. The existing embedded zero sample learning methods only use the known classes to construct the embedded space, so there is an overfitting of the known classes in the testing process. This project uses category semantic similarity measures to classify multiple tags. This enables it to incorporate unknown classes that have the same meaning as currently known classes into the vector space when it is built. At the same time, most of the existing zero sample learning algorithms directly use the depth features of medical images as input, and the feature extraction process does not consider semantic information. This project intends to take ELMo-MCT as the main task and obtain multiple visual features related to the original image through self-attention mechanism. In this paper, a large number of experiments are carried out on three zero-shot learning reference datasets, and the best harmonic average accuracy is obtained compared with the most advanced algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongrui Shen, Long Zhao, Kan Zheng, Yuhua Cao, Pingzhi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has the potential to improve the recovery accuracy and reduce the feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, the length of input CSI and the number of feedback bits should be adjustable in different scenarios, which can not be efficiently achieved by the existing CSI feedback models. Therefore, an adaptive bidirectional long short-term memory network (ABLNet) for CSI feedback is first designed to process various input CSI lengths, where the number of feedback bits is in proportion to the CSI length. Then, to realize a more flexible feedback bit number, a feedback bit control unit (FBCU) module is proposed to control the output length of feedback bits. Based on which, a target feedback performance can be adaptively achieved by a designed bit number adjusting (BNA) algorithm. Furthermore, a novel separate training approach is devised to solve the model protection problem that the UE and gNB are from different manufacturers. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed ABLNet with FBCU can fit for different input CSI lengths and feedback bit numbers; the CSI feedback performance can be stabilized by the BNA algorithm; and the proposed separate training approach can maintain the feedback performance and reduce the complexity of feedback model.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Spatial Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) technology, it is now possible to comprehensively measure gene transcription while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Spatial domain identification and gene denoising are key objectives in SRT data analysis. We propose a Contrastively Augmented Masked Graph Autoencoder (STMGAC) to learn low-dimensional latent representations for domain identification. In the latent space, persistent signals for representations are obtained through self-distillation to guide self-supervised matching. At the same time, positive and negative anchor pairs are constructed using triplet learning to augment the discriminative ability. We evaluated the performance of STMGAC on five datasets, achieving results superior to those of existing baseline methods.

<p>Abstract: Cell nuclei instance segmentation is a crucial task in digital kidney pathology. Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Gao, Hao Wang, Yuanda Wang, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Assembly code search is vital for reducing the burden on reverse engineers, allowing them to quickly identify specific functions using natural language within vast binary programs. Despite its significance, this critical task is impeded by the complexities involved in building high-quality datasets. This paper explores training a Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate a general compiler. By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion tokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC), capable of compiling any source code of any language to assembly code. This approach allows for virtual compilation across a wide range of programming languages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency and expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction. Furthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly code search. Employing this extensive dataset, we achieve a substantial improvement in assembly code search performance, with our model surpassing the leading baseline by 26%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyi Rong, Wenzhuo Zheng, Bozitao Zhong, Zhouhan Lin, Liang Hong, Ning Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme function is crucial for elucidating biological mechanisms and driving innovation across various sectors. Existing deep learning methods tend to rely solely on either sequence data or structural data and predict the EC number as a whole, neglecting the intrinsic hierarchical structure of EC numbers. To address these limitations, we introduce MAPred, a novel multi-modality and multi-scale model designed to autoregressively predict the EC number of proteins. MAPred integrates both the primary amino acid sequence and the 3D tokens of proteins, employing a dual-pathway approach to capture comprehensive protein characteristics and essential local functional sites. Additionally, MAPred utilizes an autoregressive prediction network to sequentially predict the digits of the EC number, leveraging the hierarchical organization of EC classifications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including New-392, Price, and New-815, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models, marking a significant advance in the reliability and granularity of protein function prediction within bioinformatics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamyar Zeinalipour, Neda Jamshidi, Monica Bianchini, Marco Maggini, Marco Gori</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B1, Llama-2-7B2, Llama-3-8B3, and gemma-7B4, to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available.5 Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore, we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available, fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Yuwono, Dorothea Schwung, Andreas Schwung</p>
<p>Abstract: This article describes a novel game structure for autonomously optimizing decentralized manufacturing systems with multi-objective optimization challenges, namely Distributed Stackelberg Strategies in State-Based Potential Games (DS2-SbPG). DS2-SbPG integrates potential games and Stackelberg games, which improves the cooperative trade-off capabilities of potential games and the multi-objective optimization handling by Stackelberg games. Notably, all training procedures remain conducted in a fully distributed manner. DS2-SbPG offers a promising solution to finding optimal trade-offs between objectives by eliminating the complexities of setting up combined objective optimization functions for individual players in self-learning domains, particularly in real-world industrial settings with diverse and numerous objectives between the sub-systems. We further prove that DS2-SbPG constitutes a dynamic potential game that results in corresponding converge guarantees. Experimental validation conducted on a laboratory-scale testbed highlights the efficacy of DS2-SbPG and its two variants, such as DS2-SbPG for single-leader-follower and Stack DS2-SbPG for multi-leader-follower. The results show significant reductions in power consumption and improvements in overall performance, which signals the potential of DS2-SbPG in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaojiao Guan, Yongxin Ji, Cheng Peng, Wei Zou, Xubo Tang, Jiayu Shang, Yanni Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria, playing a crucial role in microbial ecology. Phage proteins are important in understanding phage biology, such as virus infection, replication, and evolution. Although a large number of new phages have been identified via metagenomic sequencing, many of them have limited protein function annotation. Accurate function annotation of phage proteins presents several challenges, including their inherent diversity and the scarcity of annotated ones. Existing tools have yet to fully leverage the unique properties of phages in annotating protein functions. In this work, we propose a new protein function annotation tool for phages by leveraging the modular genomic structure of phage genomes. By employing embeddings from the latest protein foundation models and Transformer to capture contextual information between proteins in phage genomes, PhaGO surpasses state-of-the-art methods in annotating diverged proteins and proteins with uncommon functions by 6.78% and 13.05% improvement, respectively. PhaGO can annotate proteins lacking homology search results, which is critical for characterizing the rapidly accumulating phage genomes. We demonstrate the utility of PhaGO by identifying 688 potential holins in phages, which exhibit high structural conservation with known holins. The results show the potential of PhaGO to extend our understanding of newly discovered phages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Belotti, Fabio Dadda, Marco Cremaschi, Roberto Avogadro, Riccardo Pozzi, Matteo Palmonari</p>
<p>Abstract: Tables are crucial containers of information, but understanding their meaning may be challenging. Indeed, recently, there has been a focus on Semantic Table Interpretation (STI), i.e., the task that involves the semantic annotation of tabular data to disambiguate their meaning. Over the years, there has been a surge in interest in data-driven approaches based on deep learning that have increasingly been combined with heuristic-based approaches. In the last period, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new category of approaches for table annotation. The interest in this research field, characterised by multiple challenges, has led to a proliferation of approaches employing different techniques. However, these approaches have not been consistently evaluated on a common ground, making evaluation and comparison difficult. This work proposes an extensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches - Alligator (formerly s-elBat), Dagobah, TURL, and TableLlama; the first two belong to the family of heuristic-based algorithms, while the others are respectively encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs. The primary objective is to measure the ability of these approaches to solve the entity disambiguation task, with the ultimate aim of charting new research paths in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zibo Liu, Zhe Jiang, Shigang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term traffic flow forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation as it allows traffic managers to adjust their decisions in advance. However, the problem is challenging due to spatio-temporal correlations and complex dynamic patterns in continuous-time stream data. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) are among the state-of-the-art methods for learning continuous-time traffic dynamics. However, the traditional NDE models face issues in long-term traffic forecasting due to failures in capturing delayed traffic patterns, dynamic edge (location-to-location correlation) patterns, and abrupt trend patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a new NDE architecture called Multi-View Neural Differential Equations. Our model captures current states, delayed states, and trends in different state variables (views) by learning latent multiple representations within Neural Differential Equations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior prediction accuracy for long-term forecasting and robustness with noisy or missing inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual conversational speech summarization is an important problem, but suffers from a dearth of resources. While transcriptions exist for a number of languages, translated conversational speech is rare and datasets containing summaries are non-existent. We build upon the existing Fisher and Callhome Spanish-English Speech Translation corpus by supplementing the translations with summaries. The summaries are generated using GPT-4 from the reference translations and are treated as ground truth. The task is to generate similar summaries in the presence of transcription and translation errors. We build a baseline cascade-based system using open-source speech recognition and machine translation models. We test a range of LLMs for summarization and analyze the impact of transcription and translation errors. Adapting the Mistral-7B model for this task performs significantly better than off-the-shelf models and matches the performance of GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jahir Sadik Monon, Deeparghya Dutta Barua, Md. Mosaddek Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is emerging as a key framework for various sequential decision-making and control tasks. Unlike their single-agent counterparts, multi-agent systems necessitate successful cooperation among the agents. The deployment of these systems in real-world scenarios often requires decentralized training, a diverse set of agents, and learning from infrequent environmental reward signals. These challenges become more pronounced under partial observability and the lack of prior knowledge about agent heterogeneity. While notable studies use intrinsic motivation (IM) to address reward sparsity or cooperation in decentralized settings, those dealing with heterogeneity typically assume centralized training, parameter sharing, and agent indexing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the CoHet algorithm, which utilizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based intrinsic motivation to facilitate the learning of heterogeneous agent policies in decentralized settings, under the challenges of partial observability and reward sparsity. Evaluation of CoHet in the Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) and Vectorized Multi-Agent Simulator (VMAS) benchmarks demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in a range of cooperative multi-agent scenarios. Our research is supplemented by an analysis of the impact of the agent dynamics model on the intrinsic motivation module, insights into the performance of different CoHet variants, and its robustness to an increasing number of heterogeneous agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Proximally-sensed laser scanning offers significant potential for automated forest data capture, but challenges remain in automatically identifying tree species without additional ground data. Deep learning (DL) shows promise for automation, yet progress is slowed by the lack of large, diverse, openly available labeled datasets of single tree point clouds. This has impacted the robustness of DL models and the ability to establish best practices for species classification.
  To overcome these challenges, the FOR-species20K benchmark dataset was created, comprising over 20,000 tree point clouds from 33 species, captured using terrestrial (TLS), mobile (MLS), and drone laser scanning (ULS) across various European forests, with some data from other regions. This dataset enables the benchmarking of DL models for tree species classification, including both point cloud-based (PointNet++, MinkNet, MLP-Mixer, DGCNNs) and multi-view image-based methods (SimpleView, DetailView, YOLOv5).
  2D image-based models generally performed better (average OA = 0.77) than 3D point cloud-based models (average OA = 0.72), with consistent results across different scanning platforms and sensors. The top model, DetailView, was particularly robust, handling data imbalances well and generalizing effectively across tree sizes.
  The FOR-species20K dataset, available at https://zenodo.org/records/13255198, is a key resource for developing and benchmarking DL models for tree species classification using laser scanning data, providing a foundation for future advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yuan, Aritra Dasgupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI~(XAI) methods such as SHAP can help discover feature attributions in black-box models. If the method reveals a significant attribution from a ``protected feature'' (e.g., gender, race) on the model output, the model is considered unfair. However, adversarial attacks can subvert the detection of XAI methods. Previous approaches to constructing such an adversarial model require access to underlying data distribution, which may not be possible in many practical scenarios. We relax this constraint and propose a novel family of attacks, called shuffling attacks, that are data-agnostic. The proposed attack strategies can adapt any trained machine learning model to fool Shapley value-based explanations. We prove that Shapley values cannot detect shuffling attacks. However, algorithms that estimate Shapley values, such as linear SHAP and SHAP, can detect these attacks with varying degrees of effectiveness. We demonstrate the efficacy of the attack strategies by comparing the performance of linear SHAP and SHAP using real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating psychotherapeutic dialogues, especially in Motivational Interviewing (MI). However, how to employ strategies, a set of motivational interviewing (MI) skills, to generate therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability is underexplored. We propose an approach called strategy-aware dialogue generation with Chain-of-Strategy (CoS) planning, which first predicts MI strategies as reasoning and utilizes these strategies to guide the subsequent dialogue generation. It brings the potential for controllable and explainable generation in psychotherapy by aligning the generated MI dialogues with therapeutic strategies. Extensive experiments including automatic and human evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the MI strategy. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned dialogues and suggest directions for practical applications in psychotherapeutic settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning beamlines at synchrotron light sources is a high-dimensional, expensive-to-sample optimization problem, as beams are focused using a series of dynamic optical components. Bayesian Optimization is an efficient machine learning approach to finding global optima of beam quality, but the model can easily be impaired by faulty data points caused by the beam going off the edge of the sensor or by background noise. This study, conducted at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), is an investigation of methods to identify untrustworthy readings of beam quality and discourage the optimization model from seeking out points likely to yield low-fidelity beams. The approaches explored include dynamic pruning using loss analysis of size and position models and a lengthscale-based genetic algorithm to determine which points to include in the model for optimal fit. Each method successfully classified high and low fidelity points. This research advances BNL's mission to tackle our nation's energy challenges by providing scientists at all beamlines with access to higher quality beams, and faster convergence to these optima for their experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D reconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the neural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high dynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world conditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to pose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories: grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks. Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into this domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method enhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric grid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to color. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness against sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima. Extensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid application of large language models across various fields, the scale of these models has gradually increased, and the resources required for their pre-training have grown exponentially. Training an LLM from scratch will cost a lot of computation resources while scaling up from a smaller model is a more efficient approach and has thus attracted significant attention. In this paper, we present AquilaMoE, a cutting-edge bilingual 8*16B Mixture of Experts (MoE) language model that has 8 experts with 16 billion parameters each and is developed using an innovative training methodology called EfficientScale. This approach optimizes performance while minimizing data requirements through a two-stage process. The first stage, termed Scale-Up, initializes the larger model with weights from a pre-trained smaller model, enabling substantial knowledge transfer and continuous pretraining with significantly less data. The second stage, Scale-Out, uses a pre-trained dense model to initialize the MoE experts, further enhancing knowledge transfer and performance. Extensive validation experiments on 1.8B and 7B models compared various initialization schemes, achieving models that maintain and reduce loss during continuous pretraining. Utilizing the optimal scheme, we successfully trained a 16B model and subsequently the 8*16B AquilaMoE model, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced significantly, offering powerful vision-language understanding capabilities. However, these models often inherit severe social biases from their training datasets, leading to unfair predictions based on attributes like race and gender. This paper addresses the issue of social biases in MLLMs by i) Introducing a comprehensive Counterfactual dataset with Multiple Social Concepts (CMSC), which provides a more diverse and extensive training set compared to existing datasets. ii) Proposing an Anti-Stereotype Debiasing strategy (ASD). Our method works by revisiting the MLLM training process, rescaling the autoregressive loss function, and improving data sampling methods to counteract biases. Through extensive experiments on various MLLMs, our CMSC dataset and ASD method demonstrate a significant reduction in social biases while maintaining the models' original performance.</p>

We discuss these issues in a larger philosophical context of human knowledge acquisition and the Turing test. In addition, we illustrate the limitations of LLMs by analyzing GPT-4 responses to questions ranging from science and math to common sense reasoning. These examples show that GPT-4 can often imitate human reasoning, even though it lacks understanding. However, LLM responses are synthesized from a large LLM model trained on all available data. In contrast, human understanding is based on a small number of abstract concepts. Based on this distinction, we discuss the impact of LLMs on acquisition of human knowledge and education.</p>

Our findings reveal that belief in AI predictions is positively correlated with belief in predictions based on astrology and personality psychology. Notably, paranormal beliefs and positive AI attitudes significantly increased perceived validity, reliability, usefulness, and personalization of AI predictions. Conscientiousness was negatively correlated with belief in predictions across all sources, and interest in the prediction topic increased believability across predictions. Surprisingly, cognitive style did not significantly influence belief in predictions. These results highlight the "rational superstition" phenomenon in AI, where belief is driven more by mental heuristics and intuition than critical evaluation. We discuss implications for designing AI systems and communication strategies that foster appropriate trust and skepticism. This research contributes to our understanding of the psychology of human-AI interaction and offers insights for the design and deployment of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Phuong Le</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing number of frameworks developed for biomedical entity and relation extraction. This research effort aims to address the accelerating growth in biomedical publications and the intricate nature of biomedical texts, which are written for mainly domain experts. To handle these challenges, we develop a novel framework that utilizes external knowledge to construct a task-independent and reusable background knowledge graph for biomedical entity and relation extraction. The design of our model is inspired by how humans learn domain-specific topics. In particular, humans often first acquire the most basic and common knowledge regarding a field to build the foundational knowledge and then use that as a basis for extending to various specialized topics. Our framework employs such common-knowledge-sharing mechanism to build a general neural-network knowledge graph that is learning transferable to different domain-specific biomedical texts effectively. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model, equipped with this generalized and cross-transferable knowledge base, achieves competitive performance benchmarks, including BioRelEx for binding interaction detection and ADE for Adverse Drug Effect identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruei-Che Chang, Yuxuan Liu, Anhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated live visual descriptions can aid blind people in understanding their surroundings with autonomy and independence. However, providing descriptions that are rich, contextual, and just-in-time has been a long-standing challenge in accessibility. In this work, we develop WorldScribe, a system that generates automated live real-world visual descriptions that are customizable and adaptive to users' contexts: (i) WorldScribe's descriptions are tailored to users' intents and prioritized based on semantic relevance. (ii) WorldScribe is adaptive to visual contexts, e.g., providing consecutively succinct descriptions for dynamic scenes, while presenting longer and detailed ones for stable settings. (iii) WorldScribe is adaptive to sound contexts, e.g., increasing volume in noisy environments, or pausing when conversations start. Powered by a suite of vision, language, and sound recognition models, WorldScribe introduces a description generation pipeline that balances the tradeoffs between their richness and latency to support real-time use. The design of WorldScribe is informed by prior work on providing visual descriptions and a formative study with blind participants. Our user study and subsequent pipeline evaluation show that WorldScribe can provide real-time and fairly accurate visual descriptions to facilitate environment understanding that is adaptive and customized to users' contexts. Finally, we discuss the implications and further steps toward making live visual descriptions more context-aware and humanized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruei-Che Chang, Yuxuan Liu, Lotus Zhang, Anhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing is an iterative process that requires precise visual evaluation and manipulation for the output to match the editing intent. However, current image editing tools do not provide accessible interaction nor sufficient feedback for blind and low vision individuals to achieve this level of control. To address this, we developed EditScribe, a prototype system that makes image editing accessible using natural language verification loops powered by large multimodal models. Using EditScribe, the user first comprehends the image content through initial general and object descriptions, then specifies edit actions using open-ended natural language prompts. EditScribe performs the image edit, and provides four types of verification feedback for the user to verify the performed edit, including a summary of visual changes, AI judgement, and updated general and object descriptions. The user can ask follow-up questions to clarify and probe into the edits or verification feedback, before performing another edit. In a study with ten blind or low-vision users, we found that EditScribe supported participants to perform and verify image edit actions non-visually. We observed different prompting strategies from participants, and their perceptions on the various types of verification feedback. Finally, we discuss the implications of leveraging natural language verification loops to make visual authoring non-visually accessible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) is a crucial component of the retrieval stage in (Ads) Recommendation System that utilizes Two Tower or Siamese Networks to learn embeddings for both users and items (ads). It then employs an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) to efficiently retrieve the most relevant ads for a specific user. Despite the recent rise to popularity in the industry, they have a couple of limitations. Firstly, Two Tower model architecture uses a single dot product interaction which despite their efficiency fail to capture the data distribution in practice. Secondly, the centroid representation and cluster assignment, which are components of ANN, occur after the training process has been completed. As a result, they do not take into account the optimization criteria used for retrieval model. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Structured Neural Network (HSNN), a deployed jointly optimized hierarchical clustering and neural network model that can take advantage of sophisticated interactions and model architectures that are more common in the ranking stages while maintaining a sub-linear inference cost. We achieve 6.5% improvement in offline evaluation and also demonstrate 1.22% online gains through A/B experiments. HSNN has been successfully deployed into the Ads Recommendation system and is currently handling major portion of the traffic. The paper shares our experience in developing this system, dealing with challenges like freshness, volatility, cold start recommendations, cluster collapse and lessons deploying the model in a large scale retrieval production system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiser Sun, Mark Dredze</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large language models leads to the formation of a pre-train-then-align paradigm, in which the model is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and undergoes a tuning stage to align the model with human preference or downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuqi He, Jun Zhuang, Ding Wang, Jun Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely applied in various practical scenarios, such as predicting user interests and detecting communities in social networks. However, recent studies have shown that graph-structured networks often contain potential noise and attacks, in the form of topological perturbations and weight disturbances, which can lead to decreased classification performance in GNNs. To improve the robustness of the model, we propose a novel method: Random Walk Negative Sampling Graph Convolutional Network (RW-NSGCN). Specifically, RW-NSGCN integrates the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank (PGR) algorithms for negative sampling and employs a Determinantal Point Process (DPP)-based GCN for convolution operations. RWR leverages both global and local information to manage noise and local variations, while PGR assesses node importance to stabilize the topological structure. The DPP-based GCN ensures diversity among negative samples and aggregates their features to produce robust node embeddings, thereby improving classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the RW-NSGCN model effectively addresses network topology attacks and weight instability, increasing the accuracy of anomaly detection and overall stability. In terms of classification accuracy, RW-NSGCN significantly outperforms existing methods, showing greater resilience across various scenarios and effectively mitigating the impact of such vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinseong Park, Seungyun Lee, Woojin Jeong, Yujin Choi, Jaewook Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis test techniques. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work.</p>

On average, our method achieves a 12.5 percent improvement compared to its multiview counterparts, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning over discriminative approaches. DC3DO employs a class-conditional diffusion model trained on ShapeNet, and we run inferences on point clouds of chairs and cars.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Delu Zeng, John Paisley</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, a sparse version of Student-t Processes, termed sparse variational Student-t Processes, has been proposed to enhance computational efficiency and flexibility for real-world datasets using stochastic gradient descent. However, traditional gradient descent methods like Adam may not fully exploit the parameter space geometry, potentially leading to slower convergence and suboptimal performance. To mitigate these issues, we adopt natural gradient methods from information geometry for variational parameter optimization of Student-t Processes. This approach leverages the curvature and structure of the parameter space, utilizing tools such as the Fisher information matrix which is linked to the Beta function in our model. This method provides robust mathematical support for the natural gradient algorithm when using Student's t-distribution as the variational distribution. Additionally, we present a mini-batch algorithm for efficiently computing natural gradients. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently accelerates convergence speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Shian Du, Junmei Yang, Qianli Ma, Delu Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted version of the Bayesian GPLVMs has been proposed to obtain a tighter variational bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this work, we propose an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach to address these issues. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Shimin Di, Hanmo Liu, Zhili Wang, Jiachuan Wang, Lei Chen, Xiaofang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), like other neural networks, have shown remarkable success but are hampered by the complexity of their architecture designs, which heavily depend on specific data and tasks. Traditionally, designing proper architectures involves trial and error, which requires intensive manual effort to optimize various components. To reduce human workload, researchers try to develop automated algorithms to design GNNs. However, both experts and automated algorithms suffer from two major issues in designing GNNs: 1) the substantial computational resources expended in repeatedly trying candidate GNN architectures until a feasible design is achieved, and 2) the intricate and prolonged processes required for humans or algorithms to accumulate knowledge of the interrelationship between graphs, GNNs, and performance.
  To further enhance the automation of GNN architecture design, we propose a computation-friendly way to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized knowledge in designing GNNs, thereby drastically shortening the computational overhead and development cycle of designing GNN architectures. Our framework begins by establishing a knowledge retrieval pipeline that comprehends the intercorrelations between graphs, GNNs, and performance. This pipeline converts past model design experiences into structured knowledge for LLM reference, allowing it to quickly suggest initial model proposals. Subsequently, we introduce a knowledge-driven search strategy that emulates the exploration-exploitation process of human experts, enabling quick refinement of initial proposals within a promising scope. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can efficiently deliver promising (e.g., Top-5.77%) initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and without any prior training and achieve outstanding search performance in a few iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Firas Bayram, Bestoun S. Ahmed, Erik Hallin</p>
<p>Abstract: Within data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) systems for industrial applications, ensuring the reliability of the incoming data streams is an integral part of trustworthy decision-making. An approach to assess data validity is data quality scoring, which assigns a score to each data point or stream based on various quality dimensions. However, certain dimensions exhibit dynamic qualities, which require adaptation on the basis of the system's current conditions. Existing methods often overlook this aspect, making them inefficient in dynamic production environments. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Data Quality Scoring Operations Framework, a novel framework developed to address the challenges posed by dynamic quality dimensions in industrial data streams. The framework introduces an innovative approach by integrating a dynamic change detector mechanism that actively monitors and adapts to changes in data quality, ensuring the relevance of quality scores. We evaluate the proposed framework performance in a real-world industrial use case. The experimental results reveal high predictive performance and efficient processing time, highlighting its effectiveness in practical quality-driven AI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in large language models have raised concerns about their potential use in generating compelling election disinformation at scale. This study presents a two-part investigation into the capabilities of LLMs to automate stages of an election disinformation operation. First, we introduce DisElect, a novel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK context, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts. Using DisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these requests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also refuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to generate content from a right-wing perspective. Secondly, we conduct a series of experiments (N=2,340) to assess the "humanness" of LLMs: the extent to which disinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as human-written. Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time. Notably, we observe that multiple models achieve above-human levels of humanness. Taken together, these findings suggest that current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs than traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical benchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current and future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Gray</p>
<p>Abstract: The appreciation and utilisation of risk and uncertainty can play a key role in helping to solve some of the many ethical issues that are posed by AI. Understanding the uncertainties can allow algorithms to make better decisions by providing interrogatable avenues to check the correctness of outputs. Allowing algorithms to deal with variability and ambiguity with their inputs means they do not need to force people into uncomfortable classifications. Provenance enables algorithms to know what they know preventing possible harms. Additionally, uncertainty about provenance highlights the trustworthiness of algorithms. It is essential to compute with what we know rather than make assumptions that may be unjustified or untenable. This paper provides a perspective on the need for the importance of risk and uncertainty in the development of ethical AI, especially in high-risk scenarios. It argues that the handling of uncertainty, especially epistemic uncertainty, is critical to ensuring that algorithms do not cause harm and are trustworthy and ensure that the decisions that they make are humane.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or instead incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address the demands of efficiency, identity fidelity, and preserving the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models as a hypernetwork to predict personalized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By integrating these LoRA weights into the text-to-image model, DiffLoRA achieves personalization during inference without further training. Additionally, we propose an identity-oriented LoRA weight construction pipeline to facilitate the training of DiffLoRA. By utilizing the dataset produced by this pipeline, our DiffLoRA consistently generates high-performance and accurate LoRA weights. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Thelwall</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the quality of academic journal articles is a time consuming but critical task for national research evaluation exercises, appointments and promotion. It is therefore important to investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a role in this process. This article assesses which ChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and abstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to which scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results show that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average ChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers) correlating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is slightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest that article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even though complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple ones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough assessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and significance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model scores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Fabian Deuser, Wenping Yina, Xuanshu Luo, Paul Walther, Gengchen Mai, Wei Huang, Martin Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Nature disasters play a key role in shaping human-urban infrastructure interactions. Effective and efficient response to natural disasters is essential for building resilience and a sustainable urban environment. Two types of information are usually the most necessary and difficult to gather in disaster response. The first information is about disaster damage perception, which shows how badly people think that urban infrastructure has been damaged. The second information is geolocation awareness, which means how people whereabouts are made available. In this paper, we proposed a novel disaster mapping framework, namely CVDisaster, aiming at simultaneously addressing geolocalization and damage perception estimation using cross-view Street-View Imagery (SVI) and Very High-Resolution satellite imagery. CVDisaster consists of two cross-view models, where CVDisaster-Geoloc refers to a cross-view geolocalization model based on a contrastive learning objective with a Siamese ConvNeXt image encoder, and CVDisaster-Est is a cross-view classification model based on a Couple Global Context Vision Transformer (CGCViT). Taking Hurricane IAN as a case study, we evaluate the CVDisaster framework by creating a novel cross-view dataset (CVIAN) and conducting extensive experiments. As a result, we show that CVDisaster can achieve highly competitive performance (over 80% for geolocalization and 75% for damage perception estimation) with even limited fine-tuning efforts, which largely motivates future cross-view models and applications within a broader GeoAI research community.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Zhang, Sherif Abdulatif, Benedikt Loesch, Marco Altmann, Marius Schwarz, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning and its integration with autonomous driving systems have led to substantial advancements in 3D perception using multimodal sensors. Notably, radar sensors show greater robustness compared to cameras and lidar under adverse weather and varying illumination conditions. This study delves into the often-overlooked yet crucial issue of domain shift in 4D radar-based object detection, examining how varying environmental conditions, such as different weather patterns and road types, impact 3D object detection performance. Our findings highlight distinct domain shifts across various weather scenarios, revealing unique dataset sensitivities that underscore the critical role of radar point cloud generation. Additionally, we demonstrate that transitioning between different road types, especially from highways to urban settings, introduces notable domain shifts, emphasizing the necessity for diverse data collection across varied road environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of domain shift effects on 4D radar-based object detection. We believe this empirical study contributes to understanding the complex nature of domain shifts in radar data and suggests paths forward for data collection strategy in the face of environmental variability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Liu, Ye Guo, Tong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverter-based volt-var control is studied in this paper. One key issue in DRL-based approaches is the limited measurement deployment in active distribution networks, which leads to problems of a partially observable state and unknown reward. To address those problems, this paper proposes a robust DRL approach with a conservative critic and a surrogate reward. The conservative critic utilizes the quantile regression technology to estimate conservative state-action value function based on the partially observable state, which helps to train a robust policy; the surrogate rewards of power loss and voltage violation are designed that can be calculated from the limited measurements. The proposed approach optimizes the power loss of the whole network and the voltage profile of buses with measurable voltages while indirectly improving the voltage profile of other buses. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of the robust DRL approach in different limited measurement conditions, even when only the active power injection of the root bus and less than 10% of bus voltages are measurable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurens Walleghem</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem is a puzzle in probability theory that has gained much attention since Elga's discussion of it [Elga, Adam, Analysis 60 (2), p.143-147 (2000)]. Sleeping Beauty is put asleep, and a coin is tossed. If the outcome of the coin toss is Tails, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday, put asleep again and woken up again on Tuesday (with no recollection of having woken up on Monday). If the outcome is Heads, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday only. Each time Sleeping Beauty is woken up, she is asked what her belief is that the outcome was Heads. What should Sleeping Beauty reply? In literature arguments have been given for both 1/3 and 1/2 as the correct answer. In this short note we argue using simple Bayesian probability theory why 1/3 is the right answer, and not 1/2. Briefly, when Sleeping Beauty awakens, her being awake is nontrivial extra information that leads her to update her beliefs about Heads to 1/3. We strengthen our claim by considering an additional observer, Prince Probability, who may or may not meet Sleeping Beauty. If he meets Sleeping Beauty while she is awake, he lowers his credence in Heads to 1/3. We also briefly consider the credence in Heads of a Sleeping Beauty who knows that she is dreaming (and thus asleep).</p>

<p>Abstract: With the ever-growing variety of object detection approaches, this study explores a series of experiments that combine reinforcement learning (RL)-based visual attention methods with saliency ranking techniques to investigate transparent and sustainable solutions. By integrating saliency ranking for initial bounding box prediction and subsequently applying RL techniques to refine these predictions through a finite set of actions over multiple time steps, this study aims to enhance RL object detection accuracy. Presented as a series of experiments, this research investigates the use of various image feature extraction methods and explores diverse Deep Q-Network (DQN) architectural variations for deep reinforcement learning-based localisation agent training. Additionally, we focus on optimising the detection pipeline at every step by prioritising lightweight and faster models, while also incorporating the capability to classify detected objects, a feature absent in previous RL approaches. We show that by evaluating the performance of these trained agents using the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset, faster and more optimised models were developed. Notably, the best mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved in this study was 51.4, surpassing benchmarks set by RL-based single object detectors in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fakunle Ajewole, Joseph Damilola Akinyemi, Khadijat Tope Ladoja, Olufade Falade Williams Onifade</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of recognizing the age-separated faces of an individual, Age-Invariant Face Recognition (AIFR), has received considerable research efforts in Europe, America, and Asia, compared to Africa. Thus, AIFR research efforts have often under-represented/misrepresented the African ethnicity with non-indigenous Africans. This work developed an AIFR system for indigenous African faces to reduce the misrepresentation of African ethnicity in facial image analysis research. We adopted a pre-trained deep learning model (VGGFace) for AIFR on a dataset of 5,000 indigenous African faces (FAGE\_v2) collected for this study. FAGE\_v2 was curated via Internet image searches of 500 individuals evenly distributed across 10 African countries. VGGFace was trained on FAGE\_v2 to obtain the best accuracy of 81.80\%. We also performed experiments on an African-American subset of the CACD dataset and obtained the best accuracy of 91.5\%. The results show a significant difference in the recognition accuracies of indigenous versus non-indigenous Africans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Strack, Mahmoud Safari, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Different activation functions work best for different deep learning models. To exploit this, we leverage recent advancements in gradient-based search techniques for neural architectures to efficiently identify high-performing activation functions for a given application. We propose a fine-grained search cell that combines basic mathematical operations to model activation functions, allowing for the exploration of novel activations. Our approach enables the identification of specialized activations, leading to improved performance in every model we tried, from image classification to language models. Moreover, the identified activations exhibit strong transferability to larger models of the same type, as well as new datasets. Importantly, our automated process for creating customized activation functions is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous approaches. It can easily be applied on top of arbitrary deep learning pipelines and thus offers a promising practical avenue for enhancing deep learning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Hrckova, Jennifer Renoux, Rafael Tolosana Calasanz, Daniela Chuda, Martin Tamajka, Jakub Simko</p>
<p>Abstract: With the goal of uncovering the challenges faced by European AI students during their research endeavors, we surveyed 28 AI doctoral candidates from 13 European countries. The outcomes underscore challenges in three key areas: (1) the findability and quality of AI resources such as datasets, models, and experiments; (2) the difficulties in replicating the experiments in AI papers; (3) and the lack of trustworthiness and interdisciplinarity. From our findings, it appears that although early stage AI researchers generally tend to share their AI resources, they lack motivation or knowledge to engage more in dataset and code preparation and curation, and ethical assessments, and are not used to cooperate with well-versed experts in application domains. Furthermore, we examine existing practices in data governance and reproducibility both in computer science and in artificial intelligence. For instance, only a minority of venues actively promote reproducibility initiatives such as reproducibility evaluations.
  Critically, there is need for immediate adoption of responsible and reproducible AI research practices, crucial for society at large, and essential for the AI research community in particular. This paper proposes a combination of social and technical recommendations to overcome the identified challenges. Socially, we propose the general adoption of reproducibility initiatives in AI conferences and journals, as well as improved interdisciplinary collaboration, especially in data governance practices. On the technical front, we call for enhanced tools to better support versioning control of datasets and code, and a computing infrastructure that facilitates the sharing and discovery of AI resources, as well as the sharing, execution, and verification of experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alimjan Mattursun, Liejun Wang, Yinfeng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech self-supervised learning (SSL) represents has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple downstream tasks. However, its application in speech enhancement (SE) tasks remains immature, offering opportunities for improvement. In this study, we introduce a novel cross-domain feature fusion and multi-attention speech enhancement network, termed BSS-CFFMA, which leverages self-supervised embeddings. BSS-CFFMA comprises a multi-scale cross-domain feature fusion (MSCFF) block and a residual hybrid multi-attention (RHMA) block. The MSCFF block effectively integrates cross-domain features, facilitating the extraction of rich acoustic information. The RHMA block, serving as the primary enhancement module, utilizes three distinct attention modules to capture diverse attention representations and estimate high-quality speech signals.
  We evaluate the performance of the BSS-CFFMA model through comparative and ablation studies on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset, achieving SOTA results. Furthermore, we select three types of data from the WHAMR! dataset, a collection specifically designed for speech enhancement tasks, to assess the capabilities of BSS-CFFMA in tasks such as denoising only, dereverberation only, and simultaneous denoising and dereverberation. This study marks the first attempt to explore the effectiveness of self-supervised embedding-based speech enhancement methods in complex tasks encompassing dereverberation and simultaneous denoising and dereverberation. The demo implementation of BSS-CFFMA is available online\footnote[2]{https://github.com/AlimMat/BSS-CFFMA. \label{s1}}.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on academic research, focusing on its application to qualitative and quantitative data analysis. As GenAI tools evolve rapidly, they offer new possibilities for enhancing research productivity and democratising complex analytical processes. However, their integration into academic practice raises significant questions regarding research integrity and security, authorship, and the changing nature of scholarly work. Through an examination of current capabilities and potential future applications, this study provides insights into how researchers may utilise GenAI tools responsibly and ethically.
  We present case studies that demonstrate the application of GenAI in various research methodologies, discuss the challenges of replicability and consistency in AI-assisted research, and consider the ethical implications of increased AI integration in academia. This study explores both qualitative and quantitative applications of GenAI, highlighting tools for transcription, coding, thematic analysis, visual analytics, and statistical analysis. By addressing these issues, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the role of AI in shaping the future of academic research and provide guidance for researchers exploring the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted research tools and research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Xue, Junyu Yan, Raman Dutt, Fasih Haider, Jingshuai Liu, Steven McDonagh, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing models with robust group fairness properties is paramount, particularly in ethically sensitive domains such as medical diagnosis. Recent approaches to achieving fairness in machine learning require a substantial amount of training data and depend on model retraining, which may not be practical in real-world scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, we propose Bias-based Weight Masking Fine-Tuning (BMFT), a novel post-processing method that enhances the fairness of a trained model in significantly fewer epochs without requiring access to the original training data. BMFT produces a mask over model parameters, which efficiently identifies the weights contributing the most towards biased predictions. Furthermore, we propose a two-step debiasing strategy, wherein the feature extractor undergoes initial fine-tuning on the identified bias-influenced weights, succeeded by a fine-tuning phase on a reinitialised classification layer to uphold discriminative performance. Extensive experiments across four dermatological datasets and two sensitive attributes demonstrate that BMFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in both diagnostic accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings underscore the efficacy and robustness of BMFT in advancing fairness across various out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Our code is available at: https://github.com/vios-s/BMFT</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06900">Entendre, a Social Bot Detection Tool for Niche, Fringe, and Extreme Social Media</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Venkatesh, Kami Vinton, Dhiraj Murthy, Kellen Sharp, Akaash Kolluri</p>
<p>Abstract: Social bots-automated accounts that generate and spread content on social media-are exploiting vulnerabilities in these platforms to manipulate public perception and disseminate disinformation. This has prompted the development of public bot detection services; however, most of these services focus primarily on Twitter, leaving niche platforms vulnerable. Fringe social media platforms such as Parler, Gab, and Gettr often have minimal moderation, which facilitates the spread of hate speech and misinformation. To address this gap, we introduce Entendre, an open-access, scalable, and platform-agnostic bot detection framework. Entendre can process a labeled dataset from any social platform to produce a tailored bot detection model using a random forest classification approach, ensuring robust social bot detection. We exploit the idea that most social platforms share a generic template, where users can post content, approve content, and provide a bio (common data features). By emphasizing general data features over platform-specific ones, Entendre offers rapid extensibility at the expense of some accuracy. To demonstrate Entendre's effectiveness, we used it to explore the presence of bots among accounts posting racist content on the now-defunct right-wing platform Parler. We examined 233,000 posts from 38,379 unique users and found that 1,916 unique users (4.99%) exhibited bot-like behavior. Visualization techniques further revealed that these bots significantly impacted the network, amplifying influential rhetoric and hashtags (e.g., #qanon, #trump, #antilgbt). These preliminary findings underscore the need for tools like Entendre to monitor and assess bot activity across diverse platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubing Cao, Yongming Li, Liejun Wang, Yinfeng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in speech synthesis, remarkable achievements have been attained. In a thorough exploration of vocoders, it has been discovered that audio waveforms can be generated at speeds exceeding real-time while maintaining high fidelity, achieved through the utilization of GAN-based models. Typically, the inputs to the vocoder consist of band-limited spectral information, which inevitably sacrifices high-frequency details. To address this, we adopt the full-band Mel spectrogram information as input, aiming to provide the vocoder with the most comprehensive information possible. However, previous studies have revealed that the use of full-band spectral information as input can result in the issue of over-smoothing, compromising the naturalness of the synthesized speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose VNet, a GAN-based neural vocoder network that incorporates full-band spectral information and introduces a Multi-Tier Discriminator (MTD) comprising multiple sub-discriminators to generate high-resolution signals. Additionally, we introduce an asymptotically constrained method that modifies the adversarial loss of the generator and discriminator, enhancing the stability of the training process. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the VNet model is capable of generating high-fidelity speech and significantly improving the performance of the vocoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has demonstrated impressive performance in speech tasks, yet there remains ample opportunity for advancement in the realm of speech enhancement research. In addressing speech tasks, confining the attention mechanism solely to the temporal dimension poses limitations in effectively focusing on critical speech features. Considering the aforementioned issues, our study introduces a novel speech enhancement framework, HFSDA, which skillfully integrates heterogeneous spatial features and incorporates a dual-dimension attention mechanism to significantly enhance speech clarity and quality in noisy environments. By leveraging self-supervised learning embeddings in tandem with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrogram features, our model excels at capturing both high-level semantic information and detailed spectral data, enabling a more thorough analysis and refinement of speech signals. Furthermore, we employ the innovative Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv) technology within the spectrogram input branch, enabling enhanced extraction and integration of crucial information across multiple dimensions. Additionally, we refine the Conformer model by enhancing its feature extraction capabilities not only in the temporal dimension but also across the spectral domain. Extensive experiments on the VCTK-DEMAND dataset show that HFSDA is comparable to existing state-of-the-art models, confirming the validity of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: ASVspoof5, the fifth edition of the ASVspoof series, is one of the largest global audio security challenges.

Due to the high-frequency gaps characteristic of the ASVspoof5 dataset, we introduce Frequency Mask, a data augmentation method that masks specific frequency bands to improve CM robustness. Combining various scale of temporal information with multiple SSL features, our experiments achieved a minDCF of 0.0158 and an EER of 0.55% on the ASVspoof 5 Track 1 evaluation progress set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bauke Arends, Melle Vessies, Dirk van Osch, Arco Teske, Pim van der Harst, Ren\'e van Es, Bram van Es</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels. Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive. This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports.
  We included 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large university hospital in the Netherlands. A randomly selected subset was manually annotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac characteristics. We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques at both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision, and recall for performance evaluation. We compared the performance of span labelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct document classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span classification results.
  The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models outperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively. The weighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in SpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa.nl. Direct document classification was superior to indirect document classification using span classifiers. SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance using only 10\% of the training data. Utilizing a reduced label set yielded near-perfect document classification results.
  We recommend using our published SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models for span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports. For settings with limited training data, SetFit may be a promising alternative for document classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: The current trend to improve language model performance seems to be based on scaling up with the number of parameters (e.g. the state of the art GPT4 model has approximately 1.7 trillion parameters) or the amount of training data fed into the model. However this comes at significant costs in terms of computational resources and energy costs that compromise the sustainability of AI solutions, as well as risk relating to privacy and misuse. In this paper we present the Erasmian Language Model (ELM) a small context specific, 900 million parameter model, pre-trained and fine-tuned by and for Erasmus University Rotterdam. We show how the model performs adequately in a classroom context for essay writing, and how it achieves superior performance in subjects that are part of its context. This has implications for a wide range of institutions and organizations, showing that context specific language models may be a viable alternative for resource constrained, privacy sensitive use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Dong, Haijun Zhang, Gang Wang, Shisheng Cui, Xiping Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: By using an parametric value function to replace the Monte-Carlo rollouts for value estimation, the actor-critic (AC) algorithms can reduce the variance of stochastic policy gradient so that to improve the convergence rate. While existing works mainly focus on analyzing convergence rate of AC algorithms under Markovian noise, the impacts of momentum on AC algorithms remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first propose a heavy-ball momentum based advantage actor-critic (\mbox{HB-A2C}) algorithm by integrating the heavy-ball momentum into the critic recursion that is parameterized by a linear function. When the sample trajectory follows a Markov decision process, we quantitatively certify the acceleration capability of the proposed HB-A2C algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the proposed HB-A2C finds an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point with $\oo{\epsilon^{-2}}$ iterations for reinforcement learning tasks with Markovian noise. Moreover, we also reveal the dependence of learning rates on the length of the sample trajectory. By carefully selecting the momentum factor of the critic recursion, the proposed HB-A2C can balance the errors introduced by the initialization and the stoschastic approximation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the integration of model-based and data-driven approaches within the realm of neural speech and audio coding systems. It highlights the challenges posed by the subjective evaluation processes of speech and audio codecs and discusses the limitations of purely data-driven approaches, which often require inefficiently large architectures to match the performance of model-based methods. The study presents hybrid systems as a viable solution, offering significant improvements to the performance of conventional codecs through meticulously chosen design enhancements. Specifically, it introduces a neural network-based signal enhancer designed to post-process existing codecs' output, along with the autoencoder-based end-to-end models and LPCNet--hybrid systems that combine linear predictive coding (LPC) with neural networks. Furthermore, the paper delves into predictive models operating within custom feature spaces (TF-Codec) or predefined transform domains (MDCTNet) and examines the use of psychoacoustically calibrated loss functions to train end-to-end neural audio codecs. Through these investigations, the paper demonstrates the potential of hybrid systems to advance the field of speech and audio coding by bridging the gap between traditional model-based approaches and modern data-driven techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel cross-spectral rendering framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that generates realistic and semantically meaningful splats from registered multi-view spectrum and segmentation maps. This extension enhances the representation of scenes with multiple spectra, providing insights into the underlying materials and segmentation. We introduce an improved physically-based rendering approach for Gaussian splats, estimating reflectance and lights per spectra, thereby enhancing accuracy and realism. In a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach with respect to other recent learning-based spectral scene representation approaches (i.e., XNeRF and SpectralNeRF) as well as other non-spectral state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Our work also demonstrates the potential of spectral scene understanding for precise scene editing techniques like style transfer, inpainting, and removal. Thereby, our contributions address challenges in multi-spectral scene representation, rendering, and editing, offering new possibilities for diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Kozlowski, Carolina Pradier, Pierre Benz</p>
<p>Abstract: Topic Modeling has become a prominent tool for the study of scientific fields, as they allow for a large scale interpretation of research trends. Nevertheless, the output of these models is structured as a list of keywords which requires a manual interpretation for the labelling. This paper proposes to assess the reliability of three LLMs, namely flan, GPT-4o, and GPT-4 mini for topic labelling. Drawing on previous research leveraging BERTopic, we generate topics from a dataset of all the scientific articles (n=34,797) authored by all biology professors in Switzerland (n=465) between 2008 and 2020, as recorded in the Web of Science database. We assess the output of the three models both quantitatively and qualitatively and find that, first, both GPT models are capable of accurately and precisely label topics from the models' output keywords. Second, 3-word labels are preferable to grasp the complexity of research topics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Jie Chong, Chenxi Hou, Zhihao Yao, Seyed Mohammadjavad Seyed Talebi</p>
<p>Abstract: Web-based Large Language Model (LLM) services have been widely adopted and have become an integral part of our Internet experience. Third-party plugins enhance the functionalities of LLM by enabling access to real-world data and services. However, the privacy consequences associated with these services and their third-party plugins are not well understood. Sensitive prompt data are stored, processed, and shared by cloud-based LLM providers and third-party plugins. In this paper, we propose Casper, a prompt sanitization technique that aims to protect user privacy by detecting and removing sensitive information from user inputs before sending them to LLM services. Casper runs entirely on the user's device as a browser extension and does not require any changes to the online LLM services. At the core of Casper is a three-layered sanitization mechanism consisting of a rule-based filter, a Machine Learning (ML)-based named entity recognizer, and a browser-based local LLM topic identifier. We evaluate Casper on a dataset of 4000 synthesized prompts and show that it can effectively filter out Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and privacy-sensitive topics with high accuracy, at 98.5% and 89.9%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Almud\'evar, Alfonso Ortega, Luis Vicente, Antonio Miguel, Eduardo Lleida</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning is an approach that allows to discover and extract the factors of variation from the data. Intuitively, a representation is said to be disentangled if it separates the different factors of variation in a way that is understandable to humans. Definitions of disentanglement and metrics to measure it usually assume that the factors of variation are independent of each other. However, this is generally false in the real world, which limits the use of these definitions and metrics to very specific and unrealistic scenarios. In this paper we give a definition of disentanglement based on information theory that is also valid when the factors of variation are not independent. Furthermore, we relate this definition to the Information Bottleneck Method. Finally, we propose a method to measure the degree of disentanglement from the given definition that works when the factors of variation are not independent. We show through different experiments that the method proposed in this paper correctly measures disentanglement with non-independent factors of variation, while other methods fail in this scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pathological diagnosis remains the definitive standard for identifying tumors. The rise of multimodal large models has simplified the process of integrating image analysis with textual descriptions. Despite this advancement, the substantial costs associated with training and deploying these complex multimodal models, together with a scarcity of high-quality training datasets, create a significant divide between cutting-edge technology and its application in the clinical setting. We had meticulously compiled a dataset of approximately 45,000 cases, covering over 6 different tasks, including the classification of organ tissues, generating pathology report descriptions, and addressing pathology-related questions and answers. We have fine-tuned multimodal large models, specifically LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternLM, with this dataset to enhance instruction-based performance. We conducted a qualitative assessment of the capabilities of the base model and the fine-tuned model in performing image captioning and classification tasks on the specific dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits proficiency in addressing typical pathological questions. We hope that by making both our models and datasets publicly available, they can be valuable to the medical and research communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Rege Cambrin, Eleonora Poeta, Eliana Pastor, Tania Cerquitelli, Elena Baralis, Paolo Garza</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of crop fields is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity, monitoring crop health, and promoting sustainable practices. Deep learning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable predictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the performance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks. Our findings indicate a 2\% improvement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model in fewer GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels are irrelevant to this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flora B\"owing, Patrick Gildersleve</p>
<p>Abstract: The disparity between news stories valued by journalists and those preferred by readers, known as the "News Gap", is well-documented. However, the difference in expectations regarding news related user-generated content is less studied. Comment sections, hosted by news websites, are popular venues for reader engagement, yet still subject to editorial decisions. It is thus important to understand journalist vs reader comment preferences and how these are served by various comment ranking algorithms that represent discussions differently. We analyse 1.2 million comments from Austrian newspaper Der Standard to understand the "News Comment Gap" and the effects of different ranking algorithms. We find that journalists prefer positive, timely, complex, direct responses, while readers favour comments similar to article content from elite authors. We introduce the versatile Feature-Oriented Ranking Utility Metric (FORUM) to assess the impact of different ranking algorithms and find dramatic differences in how they prioritise the display of comments by sentiment, topical relevance, lexical diversity, and readability. Journalists can exert substantial influence over the discourse through both curatorial and algorithmic means. Understanding these choices' implications is vital in fostering engaging and civil discussions while aligning with journalistic objectives, especially given the increasing legal scrutiny and societal importance of online discourse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Yadav, Colin Raffel, Mohammed Muqeeth, Lucas Caccia, Haokun Liu, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal, Leshem Choshen, Alessandro Sordoni</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or task. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component of MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert model(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole, our survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates a solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arijit Shaw, Kuldeep S. Meel</p>
<p>Abstract: Model counting is a fundamental problem in automated reasoning with applications in probabilistic inference, network reliability, neural network verification, and more. Although model counting is computationally intractable from a theoretical perspective due to its #P-completeness, the past decade has seen significant progress in developing state-of-the-art model counters to address scalability challenges.
  In this work, we conduct a rigorous assessment of the scalability of model counters in the wild. To this end, we surveyed 11 application domains and collected an aggregate of 2262 benchmarks from these domains. We then evaluated six state-of-the-art model counters on these instances to assess scalability and runtime performance.
  Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the performance of model counters varies significantly across different application domains, underscoring the need for careful selection by the end user. Additionally, we investigated the behavior of different counters with respect to two parameters suggested by the model counting community, finding only a weak correlation. Our analysis highlights the challenges and opportunities for portfolio-based approaches in model counting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in solving real-world software engineering (SWE) problems. The most advanced open-source SWE agent can resolve over 27% of real GitHub issues in SWE-Bench Lite. However, these sophisticated agent frameworks exhibit varying strengths, excelling in certain tasks while underperforming in others. To fully harness the diversity of these agents, we propose DEI (Diversity Empowered Intelligence), a framework that leverages their unique expertise. DEI functions as a meta-module atop existing SWE agent frameworks, managing agent collectives for enhanced problem-solving. Experimental results show that a DEI-guided committee of agents is able to surpass the best individual agent's performance by a large margin. For instance, a group of open-source SWE agents, with a maximum individual resolve rate of 27.3% on SWE-Bench Lite, can achieve a 34.3% resolve rate with DEI, making a 25% improvement and beating most closed-source solutions. Our best-performing group excels with a 55% resolve rate, securing the highest ranking on SWE-Bench Lite. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on collaborative AI systems and their potential to solve complex software engineering challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Cifuentes, Leopoldo Bertossi, Nina Pardal, Sergio Abriola, Maria Vanina Martinez, Miguel Romero</p>
<p>Abstract: Attribution scores reflect how important the feature values in an input entity are for the output of a machine learning model. One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rei Tamaru, Yang Cheng, Steven Parker, Ernie Perry, Bin Ran, Soyoung Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Truck parking on freight corridors faces the major challenge of insufficient parking spaces. This is exacerbated by the Hour-of-Service (HOS) regulations, which often result in unauthorized parking practices, causing safety concerns. It has been shown that providing accurate parking usage prediction can be a cost-effective solution to reduce unsafe parking practices. In light of this, existing studies have developed various methods to predict the usage of a truck parking site and have demonstrated satisfactory accuracy. However, these studies focus on a single parking site, and few approaches have been proposed to predict the usage of multiple truck parking sites considering spatio-temporal dependencies, due to the lack of data. This paper aims to fill this gap and presents the Regional Temporal Graph Neural Network (RegT-GCN) to predict parking usage across the entire state to provide more comprehensive truck parking information. The framework leverages the topological structures of truck parking site locations and historical parking data to predict the occupancy rate considering spatio-temporal dependencies across a state. To achieve this, we introduce a Regional Decomposition approach, which effectively captures the geographical characteristics of the truck parking locations and their spatial correlations. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models, improving performance by more than 20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lekang Jiang, Stephan Goetz</p>
<p>Abstract: Patents, encapsulating crucial technical and legal information, present a rich domain for natural language processing (NLP) applications. As NLP technologies evolve, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in general text processing and generation tasks. However, the application of LLMs in the patent domain remains under-explored and under-developed due to the complexity of patent processing. Understanding the unique characteristics of patent documents and related research in the patent domain becomes essential for researchers to apply these tools effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to equip NLP researchers with the essential knowledge to navigate this complex domain efficiently. We introduce the relevant fundamental aspects of patents to provide solid background information, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the patent system. In addition, we systematically break down the structural and linguistic characteristics unique to patents and map out how NLP can be leveraged for patent analysis and generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the spectrum of text-based patent-related tasks, including nine patent analysis and four patent generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Xu, Lixin Cui, Ming Li, Yue Wang, Ziyu Lyu, Hangyuan Du, Lu Bai, Philip S. Yu, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel local graph pooling method, namely the Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling (SSHPool), for graph classification. We commence by assigning the nodes of a sample graph into different clusters, resulting in a family of separated subgraphs. We individually employ the local graph convolution units as the local structure to further compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. Since these subgraphs are separated by different clusters and the structural information cannot be propagated between them, the local convolution operation can significantly avoid the over-smoothing problem caused by message passing through edges in most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By hierarchically performing the proposed procedures on the resulting coarsened graph, the proposed SSHPool can effectively extract the hierarchical global features of the original graph structure, encapsulating rich intrinsic structural characteristics. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end GNN framework associated with the SSHPool module for graph classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Hu, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Zhiliang Xiang, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The relation between (a fragment of) assumption-based argumentation (ABA) and logic programs (LPs) under stable model semantics is well-studied. However, for obtaining this relation, the ABA framework needs to be restricted to being flat, i.e., a fragment where the (defeasible) assumptions can never be entailed, only assumed to be true or false. Here, we remove this restriction and show a correspondence between non-flat ABA and LPs with negation as failure in their head. We then extend this result to so-called set-stable ABA semantics, originally defined for the fragment of non-flat ABA called bipolar ABA. We showcase how to define set-stable semantics for LPs with negation as failure in their head and show the correspondence to set-stable ABA semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Corallo, Paolo Papotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Carlsmith</p>
<p>Abstract: This report examines what I see as the core argument for concern about existential risk from misaligned artificial intelligence. I proceed in two stages. First, I lay out a backdrop picture that informs such concern. On this picture, intelligent agency is an extremely powerful force, and creating agents much more intelligent than us is playing with fire -- especially given that if their objectives are problematic, such agents would plausibly have instrumental incentives to seek power over humans. Second, I formulate and evaluate a more specific six-premise argument that creating agents of this kind will lead to existential catastrophe by 2070. On this argument, by 2070: (1) it will become possible and financially feasible to build relevantly powerful and agentic AI systems; (2) there will be strong incentives to do so; (3) it will be much harder to build aligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems than to build misaligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems that are still superficially attractive to deploy; (4) some such misaligned systems will seek power over humans in high-impact ways; (5) this problem will scale to the full disempowerment of humanity; and (6) such disempowerment will constitute an existential catastrophe. I assign rough subjective credences to the premises in this argument, and I end up with an overall estimate of ~5% that an existential catastrophe of this kind will occur by 2070. (May 2022 update: since making this report public in April 2021, my estimate here has gone up, and is now at >10%.)</p>

<p>Abstract: To mitigate the negative effects of false information more effectively, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems assisting fact-checkers is needed. Nevertheless, the lack of focus on the needs of these stakeholders results in their limited acceptance and skepticism toward automating the whole fact-checking process. In this study, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with Central European fact-checkers. Their activities and problems were analyzed using iterative content analysis. The most significant problems were validated with a survey of European fact-checkers, in which we collected 24 responses from 20 countries, i.e., 62\% of active European signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN).
  Our contributions include an in-depth examination of the variability of fact-checking work in non-English speaking regions, which still remained largely uncovered. By aligning them with the knowledge from prior studies, we created conceptual models that help understand the fact-checking processes. Thanks to the interdisciplinary collaboration, we extend the fact-checking process in AI research by three additional stages. In addition, we mapped our findings on the fact-checkers' activities and needs to the relevant tasks for AI research. The new opportunities identified for AI researchers and developers have implications for the focus of AI research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Du, He Zhang, Xiangle Cheng, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We seek the best traffic allocation scheme for the edge-cloud computing network that satisfies constraints and minimizes the cost based on burstable billing. First, for a fixed network topology, we formulate a family of integer programming problems with random parameters describing the various traffic demands. Then, to overcome the difficulty caused by the discrete feature of the problem, we generalize the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization method to induce an unconstrained continuous optimization problem as a regularized continuation of the discrete problem. Finally, we introduce the Gumbel-softmax sampling network to solve the optimization problems via unsupervised learning. The network structure reflects the edge-cloud computing topology and is trained to minimize the expectation of the cost function for unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The trained network works as an efficient traffic allocation scheme sampler, remarkably outperforming the random strategy in feasibility and cost function value. Besides testing the quality of the output allocation scheme, we examine the generalization property of the network by increasing the time steps and the number of users. We also feed the solution to existing integer optimization solvers as initial conditions and verify the warm-starts can accelerate the short-time iteration process. The framework is general with solid performance, and the decoupled feature of the random neural networks is adequate for practical implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amr Alkhatib, Sofiane Ennadir, Henrik Bostr\"om, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: Data in tabular format is frequently occurring in real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Niu, Yizhou Xu, Xingjian Jiang, Jianming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety of autonomous vehicles (AV) has been a long-standing top concern, stemming from the absence of rare and safety-critical scenarios in the long-tail naturalistic driving distribution. To tackle this challenge, a surge of research in scenario-based autonomous driving has emerged, with a focus on generating high-risk driving scenarios and applying them to conduct safety-critical testing of AV models. However, limited work has been explored on the reuse of these extensive scenarios to iteratively improve AV models. Moreover, it remains intractable and challenging to filter through gigantic scenario libraries collected from other AV models with distinct behaviors, attempting to extract transferable information for current AV improvement. Therefore, we develop a continual driving policy optimization framework featuring Closed-Loop Individualized Curricula (CLIC), which we factorize into a set of standardized sub-modules for flexible implementation choices: AV Evaluation, Scenario Selection, and AV Training. CLIC frames AV Evaluation as a collision prediction task, where it estimates the chance of AV failures in these scenarios at each iteration. Subsequently, by re-sampling from historical scenarios based on these failure probabilities, CLIC tailors individualized curricula for downstream training, aligning them with the evaluated capability of AV. Accordingly, CLIC not only maximizes the utilization of the vast pre-collected scenario library for closed-loop driving policy optimization but also facilitates AV improvement by individualizing its training with more challenging cases out of those poorly organized scenarios. Experimental results clearly indicate that CLIC surpasses other curriculum-based training strategies, showing substantial improvement in managing risky scenarios, while still maintaining proficiency in handling simpler cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviya Maimon, Reut Tsarfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Coherence is an essential property of well-written texts, that refers to the way textual units relate to one another. In the era of generative AI, coherence assessment is essential for many NLP tasks; summarization, generation, long-form question-answering, and more. However, in NLP {coherence} is an ill-defined notion, not having a formal definition or evaluation metrics, that would allow for large-scale automatic and systematic coherence assessment. To bridge this gap, in this work we employ the formal linguistic definition of \citet{Reinhart:1980} of what makes a discourse coherent, consisting of three conditions -- {\em cohesion, consistency} and {\em relevance} -- and formalize these conditions as respective computational tasks. We hypothesize that (i) a model trained on all of these tasks will learn the features required for coherence detection, and that (ii) a joint model for all tasks will exceed the performance of models trained on each task individually. On two benchmarks for coherence scoring rated by humans, one containing 500 automatically-generated short stories and another containing 4k real-world texts, our experiments confirm that jointly training on the proposed tasks leads to better performance on each task compared with task-specific models, and to better performance on assessing coherence overall, compared with strong baselines. We conclude that the formal and computational setup of coherence as proposed here provides a solid foundation for advanced methods of large-scale automatic assessment of coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mor Ventura, Eyal Ben-David, Anna Korhonen, Roi Reichart</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-To-Image (TTI) models, such as DALL-E and StableDiffusion, have demonstrated remarkable prompt-based image generation capabilities. Multilingual encoders may have a substantial impact on the cultural agency of these models, as language is a conduit of culture. In this study, we explore the cultural perception embedded in TTI models by characterizing culture across three hierarchical tiers: cultural dimensions, cultural domains, and cultural concepts. Based on this ontology, we derive prompt templates to unlock the cultural knowledge in TTI models, and propose a comprehensive suite of evaluation techniques, including intrinsic evaluations using the CLIP space, extrinsic evaluations with a Visual-Question-Answer (VQA) model and human assessments, to evaluate the cultural content of TTI-generated images. To bolster our research, we introduce the CulText2I dataset, derived from six diverse TTI models and spanning ten languages. Our experiments provide insights regarding Do, What, Which and How research questions about the nature of cultural encoding in TTI models, paving the way for cross-cultural applications of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Geng, Hang Ruan, Runzhong Wang, Yang Li, Yang Wang, Lei Chen, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive combinatorial optimization, where the parameters of combinatorial optimization (CO) are unknown at the decision-making time, is the precise modeling of many real-world applications, including energy cost-aware scheduling and budget allocation on advertising. Tackling such a problem usually involves a prediction model and a CO solver. These two modules are integrated into the predictive CO pipeline following two design principles: ``Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)'', which learns predictions by supervised training and subsequently solves CO using predicted coefficients, while the other, named ``Predict-and-Optimize (PnO)'', directly optimizes towards the ultimate decision quality and claims to yield better decisions than traditional PtO approaches. However, there lacks a systematic benchmark of both approaches, including the specific design choices at the module level, as well as an evaluation dataset that covers representative real-world scenarios. To this end, we develop a modular framework to benchmark 11 existing PtO/PnO methods on 8 problems, including a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising that will be released. Our study shows that PnO approaches are better than PtO on 7 out of 8 benchmarks, but there is no silver bullet found for the specific design choices of PnO. A comprehensive categorization of current approaches and integration of typical scenarios are provided under a unified benchmark. Therefore, this paper could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for future PnO approach development and also offer fast prototyping for application-focused development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Ding, Yulong Cao, Ding Zhao, Chaowei Xiao, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to the potential risks associated with real-world testing. Although significant progress has been made in the visual aspects of simulators, generating complex behavior among agents remains a formidable challenge. It is not only imperative to ensure realism in the scenarios generated but also essential to incorporate preferences and conditions to facilitate controllable generation for AV training and evaluation. Traditional methods, mainly relying on memorizing the distribution of training datasets, often fall short in generating unseen scenarios. Inspired by the success of retrieval augmented generation in large language models, we present RealGen, a novel retrieval-based in-context learning framework for traffic scenario generation. RealGen synthesizes new scenarios by combining behaviors from multiple retrieved examples in a gradient-free way, which may originate from templates or tagged scenarios. This in-context learning framework endows versatile generative capabilities, including the ability to edit scenarios, compose various behaviors, and produce critical scenarios. Evaluations show that RealGen offers considerable flexibility and controllability, marking a new direction in the field of controllable traffic scenario generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waris Gill (Virginia Tech), Ali Anwar (University of Minnesota Twin Cities), Muhammad Ali Gulzar (Virginia Tech)</p>
<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost--FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML explainability approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training.
  We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for the global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction. It then selectively picks a slice of the most crucial neurons in the global model and maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-art ML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Ru, Xiaowei Cao, Zijia Liu, Jack Murdoch Moore, Xin-Ya Zhang, Xia Zhu, Wenjia Wei, Gang Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness is essential for security and reliability of machine learning systems. However, adversarial robustness enhanced by defense algorithms is easily erased as the neural network's weights update to learn new tasks. To address this vulnerability, it is essential to improve the capability of neural networks in terms of robust continual learning. Specially, we propose a novel gradient projection technique that effectively stabilizes sample gradients from previous data by orthogonally projecting back-propagation gradients onto a crucial subspace before using them for weight updates. This technique can maintaining robustness by collaborating with a class of defense algorithms through sample gradient smoothing. The experimental results on four benchmarks including Split-CIFAR100 and Split-miniImageNet, demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed approach in mitigating rapidly degradation of robustness during continual learning even when facing strong adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Weir, Kate Sanders, Orion Weller, Shreya Sharma, Dongwei Jiang, Zhengping Jiang, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Jansen, Peter Clark, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent language models enable new opportunities for structured reasoning with text, such as the construction of intuitive, proof-like textual entailment trees without relying on brittle formal logic. However, progress in this direction has been hampered by a long-standing lack of a clear protocol for determining what valid compositional entailment is. This absence causes noisy datasets and limited performance gains by modern neuro-symbolic engines. To address these problems, we formulate a consistent and theoretically grounded approach to annotating decompositional entailment and evaluate its impact on LLM-based textual inference. We find that our new dataset, RDTE (Recognizing Decompositional Textual Entailment), has a substantially higher internal consistency (+9%) than prior decompositional entailment datasets. We also find that training an RDTE-oriented entailment classifier via knowledge distillation and employing it in an entailment tree reasoning engine significantly improves both accuracy and proof quality, illustrating the practical benefit of this advance for textual inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated impressive proficiency in code completion tasks. However, they often fall short of fully understanding the extensive context of a project repository, such as the intricacies of relevant files and class hierarchies, which can result in less precise completions. To overcome these limitations, we present \tool, a multifaceted framework designed to address the complex challenges associated with repository-level code completion. Central to RepoHYPER is the {\em Repo-level Semantic Graph} (RSG), a novel semantic graph structure that encapsulates the vast context of code repositories. Furthermore, RepoHyper leverages Expand and Refine retrieval method, including a graph expansion and a link prediction algorithm applied to the RSG, enabling the effective retrieval and prioritization of relevant code snippets. Our evaluations show that \tool markedly outperforms existing techniques in repository-level code completion, showcasing enhanced accuracy across various datasets when compared to several strong baselines.

<p>Abstract: The current societal challenges exceed the capacity of human individual or collective effort alone. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives is poised to vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, when synergized, can achieve a level of collective intelligence that surpasses the collective capabilities of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This narrative review incorporates perspectives from complex network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising cognition, physical, and information layers. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. The interplay among these agents shapes the overall structure and dynamics of the system. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence. Furthermore, we present an analysis of real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by addressing the potential challenges in AI-enhanced collective intelligence and offer perspectives on future developments in this field.</p>

Recent advances in domain-adaptation and prompting methods showed promising results with minimal training data using lightweight masked language models, which are suited for well-established interpretability methods. We are first to present a systematic evaluation of these methods in a low-resource setting, by performing multi-class section classification on German doctor's letters. We conduct extensive class-wise evaluations supported by Shapley values, to validate the quality of our small training data set and to ensure the interpretability of model predictions. We demonstrate that a lightweight, domain-adapted pretrained model, prompted with just 20 shots, outperforms a traditional classification model by 30.5% accuracy. Our results serve as a process-oriented guideline for clinical information extraction projects working with low-resource.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijun Guo, Alvina Lai, Johan Hilge Thygesen, Joseph Farrington, Thomas Keen, Kezhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for potential applications in digital health, while their application in mental health is subject to ongoing debate. This systematic review aims to evaluate the usage of LLMs in mental health, focusing on their strengths and limitations in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical applications. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, JMIR, and ACM using keywords: 'mental health OR mental illness OR mental disorder OR psychiatry' AND 'large language models'. We included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, excluding non-English articles. 30 articles were evaluated, which included research on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text (n=15), usage of LLMs for mental health conversational agents (CAs) (n=7), and other applications and evaluations of LLMs in mental health (n=18). LLMs exhibit substantial effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, de-stigmatized eHealth services. However, the current risks associated with the clinical use might surpass their benefits. The study identifies several significant issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the content generated, challenges in interpretability due to the 'black box' nature of LLMs, and persistent ethical dilemmas. These include the lack of a clear ethical framework, concerns about data privacy, and the potential for over-reliance on LLMs by both therapists and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practice. Despite these issues, the rapid development of LLMs underscores their potential as new clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feifei Qian, Lixin Cui, Ming Li, Yue Wang, Hangyuan Du, Lixiang Xu, Lu Bai, Philip S. Yu, Edwin R. Hancock</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new model to learn Adaptive Kernel-based Representations (AKBR) for graph classification. Unlike state-of-the-art R-convolution graph kernels that are defined by merely counting any pair of isomorphic substructures between graphs and cannot provide an end-to-end learning mechanism for the classifier, the proposed AKBR approach aims to define an end-to-end representation learning model to construct an adaptive kernel matrix for graphs. To this end, we commence by leveraging a novel feature-channel attention mechanism to capture the interdependencies between different substructure invariants of original graphs. The proposed AKBR model can thus effectively identify the structural importance of different substructures, and compute the R-convolution kernel between pairwise graphs associated with the more significant substructures specified by their structural attentions. Since each row of the resulting kernel matrix can be theoretically seen as the embedding vector of a sample graph, the proposed AKBR model is able to directly employ the resulting kernel matrix as the graph feature matrix and input it into the classifier for classification (i.e., the SoftMax layer), naturally providing an end-to-end learning architecture between the kernel computation as well as the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed AKBR model outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph kernels and deep learning methods on standard graph benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Khalifa, David Wadden, Emma Strubell, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Iz Beltagy, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn a vast amount of knowledge during pretraining, but they are often oblivious to the source(s) of such knowledge. We investigate the problem of intrinsic source citation, where LLMs are required to cite the pretraining source supporting a generated response. Intrinsic source citation can enhance LLM transparency, interpretability, and verifiability. To give LLMs such ability, we explore source-aware training -- a recipe that involves (i) training the LLM to associate unique source document identifiers with the knowledge in each document, followed by (ii) an instruction-tuning stage to teach the LLM to cite a supporting pretraining source when prompted. Source-aware training borrows from existing pretraining/fine-tuning frameworks and requires minimal changes to the model architecture or implementation. Through experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that our training recipe can enable faithful attribution to the pretraining data without a substantial impact on the model's perplexity compared to standard pretraining. Our findings also highlight the importance of pretraining data augmentation in achieving attribution. Code and data available here: \url{https://github.com/mukhal/intrinsic-source-citation}</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has become a transformative concept, and as we approach 2030, a new paradigm known as the Internet of Senses (IoS) is emerging. Unlike conventional Virtual Reality (VR), IoS seeks to provide multi-sensory experiences, acknowledging that in our physical reality, our perception extends far beyond just sight and sound; it encompasses a range of senses. This article explores the existing technologies driving immersive multi-sensory media, delving into their capabilities and potential applications. This exploration includes a comparative analysis between conventional immersive media streaming and a proposed use case that leverages semantic communication empowered by generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). The focal point of this analysis is the substantial reduction in bandwidth consumption by 99.93% in the proposed scheme. Through this comparison, we aim to underscore the practical applications of generative AI for immersive media. Concurrently addressing major challenges in this field, such as temporal synchronization of multiple media, ensuring high throughput, minimizing the End-to-End (E2E) latency, and robustness to low bandwidth while outlining future trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandrajit Bajaj, Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with continuous state and action spaces remains one of the most challenging problems within the field. Most current learning methods focus on integral identities such as value functions to derive an optimal strategy for the learning agent. In this paper, we instead study the dual form of the original RL formulation to propose the first differential RL framework that can handle settings with limited training samples and short-length episodes. Our approach introduces Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise and stage-wise iteration method that optimizes policies encoded by local-movement operators. We prove a pointwise convergence estimate for DPO and provide a regret bound comparable with the best current theoretical derivation. Such pointwise estimate ensures that the learned policy matches the optimal path uniformly across different steps. We then apply DPO to a class of practical RL problems with continuous state and action spaces, and which search for optimal configurations with Lagrangian rewards. DPO is easy to implement, scalable, and shows competitive results on benchmarking experiments against several popular RL methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of spatiotemporal action localization in chaotic scenes is a challenging task toward advanced video understanding. Paving the way with high-quality video feature extraction and enhancing the precision of detector-predicted anchors can effectively improve model performance. To this end, we propose a high-performance dual-stream spatiotemporal feature extraction network SFMViT with an anchor pruning strategy. The backbone of our SFMViT is composed of ViT and SlowFast with prior knowledge of spatiotemporal action localization, which fully utilizes ViT's excellent global feature extraction capabilities and SlowFast's spatiotemporal sequence modeling capabilities. Secondly, we introduce the confidence maximum heap to prune the anchors detected in each frame of the picture to filter out the effective anchors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip Koopman, William Widen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing definitions and associated conceptual frameworks for computer-based system safety should be revisited in light of real-world experiences from deploying autonomous vehicles. Current terminology used by industry safety standards emphasizes mitigation of risk from specifically identified hazards, and carries assumptions based on human-supervised vehicle operation. Operation without a human driver dramatically increases the scope of safety concerns, especially due to operation in an open world environment, a requirement to self-enforce operational limits, participation in an ad hoc sociotechnical system of systems, and a requirement to conform to both legal and ethical constraints. Existing standards and terminology only partially address these new challenges. We propose updated definitions for core system safety concepts that encompass these additional considerations as a starting point for evolving safe-ty approaches to address these additional safety challenges. These results might additionally inform framing safety terminology for other autonomous system applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Bach Nguyen, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual text generation aims to minimally change a text, such that it is classified differently. Judging advancements in method development for counterfactual text generation is hindered by a non-uniform usage of data sets and metrics in related work. We propose CEval, a benchmark for comparing counterfactual text generation methods. CEval unifies counterfactual and text quality metrics, includes common counterfactual datasets with human annotations, standard baselines (MICE, GDBA, CREST) and the open-source language model LLAMA-2. Our experiments found no perfect method for generating counterfactual text. Methods that excel at counterfactual metrics often produce lower-quality text while LLMs with simple prompts generate high-quality text but struggle with counterfactual criteria. By making CEval available as an open-source Python library, we encourage the community to contribute more methods and maintain consistent evaluation in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanchun Wang, Xiangrong Zhang, Zelin Peng, Tianyang Zhang, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Land cover analysis using hyperspectral images (HSI) remains an open problem due to their low spatial resolution and complex spectral information. Recent studies are primarily dedicated to designing Transformer-based architectures for spatial-spectral long-range dependencies modeling, which is computationally expensive with quadratic complexity. Selective structured state space model (Mamba), which is efficient for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, has recently shown promising progress. However, its potential in hyperspectral image processing that requires handling numerous spectral bands has not yet been explored. In this paper, we innovatively propose S$^2$Mamba, a spatial-spectral state space model for hyperspectral image classification, to excavate spatial-spectral contextual features, resulting in more efficient and accurate land cover analysis. In S$^2$Mamba, two selective structured state space models through different dimensions are designed for feature extraction, one for spatial, and the other for spectral, along with a spatial-spectral mixture gate for optimal fusion. More specifically, S$^2$Mamba first captures spatial contextual relations by interacting each pixel with its adjacent through a Patch Cross Scanning module and then explores semantic information from continuous spectral bands through a Bi-directional Spectral Scanning module. Considering the distinct expertise of the two attributes in homogenous and complicated texture scenes, we realize the Spatial-spectral Mixture Gate by a group of learnable matrices, allowing for the adaptive incorporation of representations learned across different dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on HSI classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and prospect of S$^2$Mamba. The code will be made available at: https://github.com/PURE-melo/S2Mamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxi Song, Ruihan Qin, Huixia Ren, Zhen Liang, Yi Guo, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-center data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability significantly challenge the intelligent diagnosis of diseases using brain signals. A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Poesina, Cornelia Caragea, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography. Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renqiang Luo, Huafei Huang, Shuo Yu, Zhuoyang Han, Estrid He, Xiuzhen Zhang, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often face a challenging trade-off, where prioritizing fairness may require compromising utility. In this work, we re-examine fairness through the lens of spectral graph theory, aiming to reconcile fairness and utility within the framework of spectral graph learning. We explore the correlation between sensitive features and spectrum in GNNs, using theoretical analysis to delineate the similarity between original sensitive features and those after convolution under different spectra. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the impact of similarity when the eigenvectors associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalue exhibit directional similarity. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose FUGNN, a novel spectral graph learning approach that harmonizes the conflict between fairness and utility. FUGNN ensures algorithmic fairness and utility by truncating the spectrum and optimizing eigenvector distribution during the encoding process. The fairness-aware eigenvector selection reduces the impact of convolution on sensitive features while concurrently minimizing the sacrifice of utility. FUGNN further optimizes the distribution of eigenvectors through a transformer architecture. By incorporating the optimized spectrum into the graph convolution network, FUGNN effectively learns node representations. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of FUGNN over baseline methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/yushuowiki/FUGNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravil Mussabayev</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation models, particularly for method name prediction, poses significant challenges. A robust metric must account for the versatility of method naming, considering both semantic and syntactic variations. Traditional overlap-based metrics, such as ROUGE, fail to capture these nuances. Existing embedding-based metrics often suffer from imbalanced precision and recall, lack normalized scores, or make unrealistic assumptions about sequences. To address these limitations, we leverage the theory of optimal transport and construct WRDScore, a novel metric that strikes a balance between simplicity and effectiveness. In the WRDScore framework, we define precision as the maximum degree to which the predicted sequence's tokens are included in the reference sequence, token by token. Recall is calculated as the total cost of the optimal transport plan that maps the reference sequence to the predicted one. Finally, WRDScore is computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing these two complementary metrics. Our metric is lightweight, normalized, and precision-recall-oriented, avoiding unrealistic assumptions while aligning well with human judgments. Experiments on a human-curated dataset confirm the superiority of WRDScore over other available text metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, the efficiency of training and inference remains a major challenge. To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaoMi/subllm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Fu, Muyu He, Yujie Lu, William Yang Wang, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel task and benchmark for evaluating the ability of text-to-image(T2I) generation models to produce images that align with commonsense in real life, which we call Commonsense-T2I. Given two adversarial text prompts containing an identical set of action words with minor differences, such as "a lightbulb without electricity" v.s. "a lightbulb with electricity", we evaluate whether T2I models can conduct visual-commonsense reasoning, e.g. produce images that fit "the lightbulb is unlit" vs. "the lightbulb is lit" correspondingly. Commonsense-T2I presents an adversarial challenge, providing pairwise text prompts along with expected outputs. The dataset is carefully hand-curated by experts and annotated with fine-grained labels, such as commonsense type and likelihood of the expected outputs, to assist analyzing model behavior. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art (sota) T2I models and surprisingly find that, there is still a large gap between image synthesis and real life photos--even the DALL-E 3 model could only achieve 48.92% on Commonsense-T2I, and the stable diffusion XL model only achieves 24.92% accuracy. Our experiments show that GPT-enriched prompts cannot solve this challenge, and we include a detailed analysis about possible reasons for such deficiency. We aim for Commonsense-T2I to serve as a high-quality evaluation benchmark for T2I commonsense checking, fostering advancements in real life image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Shi, Chiyu Ma, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge offers a promising alternative to human judges across various tasks, yet inherent biases, particularly position bias - a systematic preference for answers based on their position in the prompt - compromise its effectiveness. Our study investigates this issue by developing a framework to systematically study and quantify position bias using metrics such as repetitional consistency, positional consistency, and positional fairness. We conduct experiments with 9 judge models across 22 tasks from the MTBench and DevBench benchmarks and nearly 40 answer-generating models, generating approximately 80,000 evaluation instances. This comprehensive assessment reveals significant variations in bias across judges and tasks. Although GPT-4 often excels in positional consistency and fairness, some more cost-effective models perform comparably or even better in specific tasks, highlighting essential trade-offs between consistency, fairness, and cost. Our results also demonstrate high consistency of judgment across repetitions, confirming that position bias is not due to random variations. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluation. These insights guide the selection of optimal judge models, enhance benchmark design, and lay the foundation for future research into effective debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Ghandeharioun, Ann Yuan, Marius Guerard, Emily Reif, Michael A. Lepori, Lucas Dixon</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite investments in improving model safety, studies show that misaligned capabilities remain latent in safety-tuned models. In this work, we shed light on the mechanics of this phenomenon. First, we show that even when model generations are safe, harmful content can persist in hidden representations and can be extracted by decoding from earlier layers. Then, we show that whether the model divulges such content depends significantly on its perception of who it is talking to, which we refer to as user persona. In fact, we find manipulating user persona to be even more effective for eliciting harmful content than direct attempts to control model refusal. We study both natural language prompting and activation steering as control methods and show that activation steering is significantly more effective at bypassing safety filters. We investigate why certain personas break model safeguards and find that they enable the model to form more charitable interpretations of otherwise dangerous queries. Finally, we show we can predict a persona's effect on refusal given only the geometry of its steering vector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Chen, Hang Yu, Weidong Liu, Subin Huang, Sanmin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in social media, conveyed through text-image combinations, presents significant challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been proven to overestimate performance, as they struggle to effectively capture the intricate sarcastic cues that arise from the interaction between an image and text. To address these issues, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, a novel framework for multi-modal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we introduce an Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) as the backbone to extract text-image representations, enhancing them by embedding cross-modality information directly within each encoder, thereby improving the representations to capture text-image interactions better. Furthermore, an efficient training strategy is designed to adapt InterCLIP for our proposed Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP). MEP uses a dynamic, fixed-length dual-channel memory to store historical knowledge of valuable test samples during inference. It then leverages this memory as a non-parametric classifier to derive the final prediction, offering a more robust recognition of multi-modal sarcasm. Experiments demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMSD2.0 benchmark, with an accuracy improvement of 1.08% and an F1 score improvement of 1.51% over the previous best method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songming Zhang, Xue Zhang, Zengkui Sun, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is known as a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) via transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred. However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads. We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD. On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention mechanism, which can automatically align the representations of the two models with different vocabularies. Thus, our framework is not only compatible with various distance functions for KD (e.g., KL divergence) like the current framework, but also supports KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Experiments on task-agnostic instruction-following benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms the current white-box KD framework with various distance functions, and also surpasses existing KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The large volume and variety of imaging data from high-throughput screening (HTS) in the pharmaceutical industry present an excellent resource for training virtual staining models. However, the potential of models trained under one set of experimental conditions to generalize to other conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates whether data from three cell types (lung, ovarian, and breast) and two phenotypes (toxic and non-toxic conditions) commonly found in HTS can effectively train virtual staining models to generalize across three typical HTS distribution shifts: unseen phenotypes, unseen cell types, and the combination of both. Utilizing a dataset of 772,416 paired bright-field, cytoplasm, nuclei, and DNA-damage stain images, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across pixel-based, instance-wise, and biological-feature-based levels. Our findings indicate that training virtual nuclei and cytoplasm models on non-toxic condition samples not only generalizes to toxic condition samples but leads to improved performance across all evaluation levels compared to training on toxic condition samples. Generalization to unseen cell types shows variability depending on the cell type; models trained on ovarian or lung cell samples often perform well under other conditions, while those trained on breast cell samples consistently show poor generalization. Generalization to unseen cell types and phenotypes shows good generalization across all levels of evaluation compared to addressing unseen cell types alone. This study represents the first large-scale, data-centric analysis of the generalization capability of virtual staining models trained on diverse HTS datasets, providing valuable strategies for experimental training data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianhui Wang, Gang Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel neuro-fuzzy model, termed fuzzy recurrent stochastic configuration networks (F-RSCNs), for industrial data analytics. Unlike the original recurrent stochastic configuration network (RSCN), the proposed F-RSCN is constructed by multiple sub-reservoirs, and each sub-reservoir is associated with a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule. Through this hybrid framework, first, the interpretability of the model is enhanced by incorporating fuzzy reasoning to embed the prior knowledge into the network. Then, the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model are determined by the recurrent stochastic configuration (RSC) algorithm. This scheme not only ensures the universal approximation property and fast learning speed of the built model but also overcomes uncertain problems, such as unknown dynamic orders, arbitrary structure determination, and the sensitivity of learning parameters in modelling nonlinear dynamics. Finally, an online update of the output weights is performed using the projection algorithm, and the convergence analysis of the learning parameters is given. By integrating TSK fuzzy inference systems into RSCNs, F-RSCNs have strong fuzzy inference capability and can achieve sound performance for both learning and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed F-RSCNs outperform other classical neuro-fuzzy and non-fuzzy models, demonstrating great potential for modelling complex industrial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgos Armeniakos, Alexis Maras, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in quantization and mixed-precision approaches offers substantial opportunities to improve the speed and energy efficiency of Neural Networks (NN). Research has shown that individual parameters with varying low precision, can attain accuracies comparable to full-precision counterparts. However, modern embedded microprocessors provide very limited support for mixed-precision NNs regarding both Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions and their hardware design for efficient execution of mixed-precision operations, i.e., introducing several performance bottlenecks due to numerous instructions for data packing and unpacking, arithmetic unit under-utilizations etc. In this work, we bring together, for the first time, ISA extensions tailored to mixed-precision hardware optimizations, targeting energy-efficient DNN inference on leading RISC-V CPU architectures. To this end, we introduce a hardware-software co-design framework that enables cooperative hardware design, mixed-precision quantization, ISA extensions and inference in cycle-accurate emulations. At hardware level, we firstly expand the ALU unit within our proof-of-concept micro-architecture to support configurable fine grained mixed-precision arithmetic operations. Subsequently, we implement multi-pumping to minimize execution latency, with an additional soft SIMD optimization applied for 2-bit operations. At the ISA level, three distinct MAC instructions are encoded extending the RISC-V ISA, and exposed up to the compiler level, each corresponding to a different mixed-precision operational mode. Our extensive experimental evaluation over widely used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our framework can achieve, on average, 15x energy reduction for less than 1% accuracy loss and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these LLMs still have numerous inherent vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. By investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and inform the development of more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analyzing-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% attack success rate (ASR) and 1.06 attack efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse. The code is publicly available at hhttps://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack.

In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mrinal Verghese, Brian Chen, Hamid Eghbalzadeh, Tushar Nagarajan, Ruta Desai</p>
<p>Abstract: Our research investigates the capability of modern multimodal reasoning models, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), to facilitate vision-powered assistants for multi-step daily activities. Such assistants must be able to 1) encode relevant visual history from the assistant's sensors, e.g., camera, 2) forecast future actions for accomplishing the activity, and 3) replan based on the user in the loop. To evaluate the first two capabilities, grounding visual history and forecasting in short and long horizons, we conduct benchmarking of two prominent classes of multimodal LLM approaches -- Socratic Models and Vision Conditioned Language Models (VCLMs) on video-based action anticipation tasks using offline datasets. These offline benchmarks, however, do not allow us to close the loop with the user, which is essential to evaluate the replanning capabilities and measure successful activity completion in assistive scenarios. To that end, we conduct a first-of-its-kind user study, with 18 participants performing 3 different multi-step cooking activities while wearing an egocentric observation device called Aria and following assistance from multimodal LLMs. We find that the Socratic approach outperforms VCLMs in both offline and online settings. We further highlight how grounding long visual history, common in activity assistance, remains challenging in current models, especially for VCLMs, and demonstrate that offline metrics do not indicate online performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Wang, Yuheng Chen, Wanting Wen, Yu Sheng, Linjing Li, Daniel Dajun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks. Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs. Code and data will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekai Li, Ziyao Guo, Wangbo Zhao, Tianle Zhang, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Samir Khaki, Kaipeng Zhang, Ahmad Sajedi, Konstantinos N Plataniotis, Kai Wang, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation aims to compress a large dataset into a significantly more compact, synthetic one without compromising the performance of the trained models. To achieve this, existing methods use the agent model to extract information from the target dataset and embed it into the distilled dataset. Consequently, the quality of extracted and embedded information determines the quality of the distilled dataset. In this work, we find that existing methods introduce misaligned information in both information extraction and embedding stages. To alleviate this, we propose Prioritize Alignment in Dataset Distillation (PAD), which aligns information from the following two perspectives. 1) We prune the target dataset according to the compressing ratio to filter the information that can be extracted by the agent model. 2) We use only deep layers of the agent model to perform the distillation to avoid excessively introducing low-level information. This simple strategy effectively filters out misaligned information and brings non-trivial improvement for mainstream matching-based distillation algorithms. Furthermore, built on trajectory matching, \textbf{PAD} achieves remarkable improvements on various benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabo Ye, Haiyang Xu, Haowei Liu, Anwen Hu, Ming Yan, Qi Qian, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Mirzaeifard, Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed sensors in the internet-of-things (IoT) generate vast amounts of sparse data. Analyzing this high-dimensional data and identifying relevant predictors pose substantial challenges, especially when data is preferred to remain on the device where it was collected for reasons such as data integrity, communication bandwidth, and privacy. This paper introduces a federated quantile regression algorithm to address these challenges. Quantile regression provides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables than mean regression models. However, traditional approaches face difficulties when dealing with nonconvex sparse penalties and the inherent non-smoothness of the loss function. For this purpose, we propose a federated smoothing proximal gradient (FSPG) algorithm that integrates a smoothing mechanism with the proximal gradient framework, thereby enhancing both precision and computational speed. This integration adeptly handles optimization over a network of devices, each holding local data samples, making it particularly effective in federated learning scenarios. The FSPG algorithm ensures steady progress and reliable convergence in each iteration by maintaining or reducing the value of the objective function. By leveraging nonconvex penalties, such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the proposed method can identify and preserve key predictors within sparse models. Comprehensive simulations validate the robust theoretical foundations of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate improved estimation precision and reliable convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wu, Xuerong Zhou, Guansong Pang, Zhiwei Yang, Qingsen Yan, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunsoo Im, Changhyun Jee, Jung Kwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Person detection and tracking (PDT) has seen significant advancements with 2D camera-based systems in the autonomous vehicle field, leading to widespread adoption of these algorithms. However, growing privacy concerns have recently emerged as a major issue, prompting a shift towards LiDAR-based PDT as a viable alternative. Within this domain, "Tracking-by-Detection" (TBD) has become a prominent methodology. Despite its effectiveness, LiDAR-based PDT has not yet achieved the same level of performance as camera-based PDT. This paper examines key components of the LiDAR-based PDT framework, including detection post-processing, data association, motion modeling, and lifecycle management. Building upon these insights, we introduce SpbTrack, a robust person tracker designed for diverse environments. Our method achieves superior performance on noisy datasets and state-of-the-art results on KITTI Dataset benchmarks and custom office indoor dataset among LiDAR-based trackers.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240">Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Nash</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</p>
