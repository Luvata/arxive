<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert L. West, Spencer Eckler, Brendan Conway-Smith, Nico Turcas, Eilene Tomkins-Flanagan, Mary Alexandria Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a theoretical framework for adapting the Common Model of Cognition to large generative network models within the field of artificial intelligence. This can be accomplished by restructuring modules within the Common Model into shadow production systems that are peripheral to a central production system, which handles higher-level reasoning based on the shadow productions' output. Implementing this novel structure within the Common Model allows for a seamless connection between cognitive architectures and generative neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shameem A. Puthiya Parambath, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Roderick Murray-Smith, Sean MacAvaney, Evangelos Zervas</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the query recommendation problem in closed loop interactive learning settings like online information gathering and exploratory analytics. The problem can be naturally modelled using the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework with countably many arms. The standard MAB algorithms for countably many arms begin with selecting a random set of candidate arms and then applying standard MAB algorithms, e.g., UCB, on this candidate set downstream. We show that such a selection strategy often results in higher cumulative regret and to this end, we propose a selection strategy based on the maximum utility of the arms. We show that in tasks like online information gathering, where sequential query recommendations are employed, the sequences of queries are correlated and the number of potentially optimal queries can be reduced to a manageable size by selecting queries with maximum utility with respect to the currently executing query. Our experimental results using a recent real online literature discovery service log file demonstrate that the proposed arm selection strategy improves the cumulative regret substantially with respect to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. % and commonly used random selection strategy for a variety of contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Ghaderi, Brandon Foreman, Amin Nayebi, Sindhu Tipirneni, Chandan K. Reddy, Vignesh Subbian</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining clinically relevant physiological states from multivariate time series data with missing values is essential for providing appropriate treatment for acute conditions such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), respiratory failure, and heart failure. Utilizing non-temporal clustering or data imputation and aggregation techniques may lead to loss of valuable information and biased analyses. In our study, we apply the SLAC-Time algorithm, an innovative self-supervision-based approach that maintains data integrity by avoiding imputation or aggregation, offering a more useful representation of acute patient states. By using SLAC-Time to cluster data in a large research dataset, we identified three distinct TBI physiological states and their specific feature profiles. We employed various clustering evaluation metrics and incorporated input from a clinical domain expert to validate and interpret the identified physiological states. Further, we discovered how specific clinical events and interventions can influence patient states and state transitions.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18831">DeepTraderX: Challenging Conventional Trading Strategies with Deep Learning in Multi-Threaded Market Simulations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Mihai Cismaru</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DeepTraderX (DTX), a simple Deep Learning-based trader, and present results that demonstrate its performance in a multi-threaded market simulation. In a total of about 500 simulated market days, DTX has learned solely by watching the prices that other strategies produce. By doing this, it has successfully created a mapping from market data to quotes, either bid or ask orders, to place for an asset. Trained on historical Level-2 market data, i.e., the Limit Order Book (LOB) for specific tradable assets, DTX processes the market state $S$ at each timestep $T$ to determine a price $P$ for market orders. The market data used in both training and testing was generated from unique market schedules based on real historic stock market data. DTX was tested extensively against the best strategies in the literature, with its results validated by statistical analysis. Our findings underscore DTX's capability to rival, and in many instances, surpass, the performance of public-domain traders, including those that outclass human traders, emphasising the efficiency of simple models, as this is required to succeed in intricate multi-threaded simulations. This highlights the potential of leveraging "black-box" Deep Learning systems to create more efficient financial markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhu, Ahmet Enis Cetin</p>
<p>Abstract: The lack of an efficient preamble detection algorithm remains a challenge for solving preamble collision problems in intelligent massive random access (RA) in practical communication scenarios. To solve this problem, we present a novel early preamble detection scheme based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model at the first step of the grant-based RA procedure. A novel blind normalized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)-based detector is proposed to obtain an approximate solution to the MLE model. First, by exploring the relationship between the Hadamard transform and wavelet transform, a new modified Hadamard transform (MHT) is developed to separate high-frequencies from important components using the second-order derivative filter. Next, to eliminate noise and mitigate the vanishing gradients problem in the SVGD-based detectors, the block MHT layer is designed based on the MHT, scaling layer, soft-thresholding layer, inverse MHT and sparsity penalty. Then, the blind normalized SVGD algorithm is derived to perform preamble detection without prior knowledge of noise power and the number of active devices. The experimental results show the proposed block MHT layer outperforms other transform-based methods in terms of computation costs and denoising performance. Furthermore, with the assistance of the block MHT layer, the proposed blind normalized SVGD algorithm achieves a higher preamble detection accuracy and throughput than other state-of-the-art detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonito Aerts Argu\"elles</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the phenomenon of categorical perception within the quantum measurement process. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon consists in dilating stimuli being perceived to belong to different categories and contracting stimuli being perceived to belong to the same category. We show that, due to the naturally different way in determining the distance between pure states compared to the distance between density states, the phenomenon of categorical perception is rooted in the structure of the quantum measurement process itself. We apply our findings to the situation of visual perception of colors and argue that it is possible to consider colors as light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light frequencies. In our approach we see perception as a complex encounter between the existing physical reality, the stimuli, and the reality expected by the perciever, resulting in the experience of the percepts. We investigate what that means for the situation of two colors, which we call Light and Dark, given our findings on categorical perception within the quantum measurement process.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18864">Interpretable Machine Learning for Weather and Climate Prediction: A Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruyi Yang, Jingyu Hu, Zihao Li, Jianli Mu, Tingzhao Yu, Jiangjiang Xia, Xuhong Li, Aritra Dasgupta, Haoyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced machine learning models have recently achieved high predictive accuracy for weather and climate prediction. However, these complex models often lack inherent transparency and interpretability, acting as "black boxes" that impede user trust and hinder further model improvements. As such, interpretable machine learning techniques have become crucial in enhancing the credibility and utility of weather and climate modeling. In this survey, we review current interpretable machine learning approaches applied to meteorological predictions. We categorize methods into two major paradigms: 1) Post-hoc interpretability techniques that explain pre-trained models, such as perturbation-based, game theory based, and gradient-based attribution methods. 2) Designing inherently interpretable models from scratch using architectures like tree ensembles and explainable neural networks. We summarize how each technique provides insights into the predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relationships captured by machine learning. Lastly, we discuss research challenges around achieving deeper mechanistic interpretations aligned with physical principles, developing standardized evaluation benchmarks, integrating interpretability into iterative model development workflows, and providing explainability for large foundation models.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18870">SugarcaneNet2024: An Optimized Weighted Average Ensemble Approach of LASSO Regularized Pre-trained Models for Sugarcane Disease Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Simul Hasan Talukder, Sharmin Akter, Abdullah Hafez Nur</p>
<p>Abstract: Sugarcane, a key crop for the world's sugar industry, is prone to several diseases that have a substantial negative influence on both its yield and quality. To effectively manage and implement preventative initiatives, diseases must be detected promptly and accurately. In this study, we present a unique model called sugarcaneNet2024 that outperforms previous methods for automatically and quickly detecting sugarcane disease through leaf image processing. Our proposed model consolidates an optimized weighted average ensemble of seven customized and LASSO-regularized pre-trained models, particularly InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, DenseNet169, Xception, and ResNet152V2. Initially, we added three more dense layers with 0.0001 LASSO regularization, three 30% dropout layers, and three batch normalizations with renorm enabled at the bottom of these pre-trained models to improve the performance. The accuracy of sugarcane leaf disease classification was greatly increased by this addition. Following this, several comparative studies between the average ensemble and individual models were carried out, indicating that the ensemble technique performed better. The average ensemble of all modified pre-trained models produced outstanding outcomes: 100%, 99%, 99%, and 99.45% for f1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy, respectively. Performance was further enhanced by the implementation of an optimized weighted average ensemble technique incorporated with grid search. This optimized sugarcaneNet2024 model performed the best for detecting sugarcane diseases, having achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.67%, 100%, 100%, and 100% , respectively.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18871">Clinical Domain Knowledge-Derived Template Improves Post Hoc AI Explanations in Pneumothorax Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Yuan, Chuan Hong, Pengtao Jiang, Gangming Zhao, Nguyen Tuan Anh Tran, Xinxing Xu, Yet Yen Yan, Nan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Pneumothorax is an acute thoracic disease caused by abnormal air collection between the lungs and chest wall. To address the opaqueness often associated with deep learning (DL) models, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced to outline regions related to pneumothorax diagnoses made by DL models. However, these explanations sometimes diverge from actual lesion areas, highlighting the need for further improvement. Method: We propose a template-guided approach to incorporate the clinical knowledge of pneumothorax into model explanations generated by XAI methods, thereby enhancing the quality of these explanations. Utilizing one lesion delineation created by radiologists, our approach first generates a template that represents potential areas of pneumothorax occurrence. This template is then superimposed on model explanations to filter out extraneous explanations that fall outside the template's boundaries. To validate its efficacy, we carried out a comparative analysis of three XAI methods with and without our template guidance when explaining two DL models in two real-world datasets. Results: The proposed approach consistently improved baseline XAI methods across twelve benchmark scenarios built on three XAI methods, two DL models, and two datasets. The average incremental percentages, calculated by the performance improvements over the baseline performance, were 97.8% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 94.1% in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) when comparing model explanations and ground-truth lesion areas. Conclusions: In the context of pneumothorax diagnoses, we proposed a template-guided approach for improving AI explanations. We anticipate that our template guidance will forge a fresh approach to elucidating AI models by integrating clinical domain expertise.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18872">Targeted Visualization of the Backbone of Encoder LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Roberts, Alexander Schulz, Luca Hermes, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention based Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art in natural language processing (NLP). The two most common architectures are encoders such as BERT, and decoders like the GPT models. Despite the success of encoder models, on which we focus in this work, they also bear several risks, including issues with bias or their susceptibility for adversarial attacks, signifying the necessity for explainable AI to detect such issues. While there does exist various local explainability methods focusing on the prediction of single inputs, global methods based on dimensionality reduction for classification inspection, which have emerged in other domains and that go further than just using t-SNE in the embedding space, are not widely spread in NLP.
  To reduce this gap, we investigate the application of DeepView, a method for visualizing a part of the decision function together with a data set in two dimensions, to the NLP domain. While in previous work, DeepView has been used to inspect deep image classification models, we demonstrate how to apply it to BERT-based NLP classifiers and investigate its usability in this domain, including settings with adversarially perturbed input samples and pre-trained, fine-tuned, and multi-task models.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18910">A Geometric Explanation of the Likelihood OOD Detection Paradox</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamidreza Kamkari, Brendan Leigh Ross, Jesse C. Cresswell, Anthony L. Caterini, Rahul G. Krishnan, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem</p>
<p>Abstract: Likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) commonly exhibit a puzzling behaviour: when trained on a relatively complex dataset, they assign higher likelihood values to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from simpler sources. Adding to the mystery, OOD samples are never generated by these DGMs despite having higher likelihoods. This two-pronged paradox has yet to be conclusively explained, making likelihood-based OOD detection unreliable. Our primary observation is that high-likelihood regions will not be generated if they contain minimal probability mass. We demonstrate how this seeming contradiction of large densities yet low probability mass can occur around data confined to low-dimensional manifolds. We also show that this scenario can be identified through local intrinsic dimension (LID) estimation, and propose a method for OOD detection which pairs the likelihoods and LID estimates obtained from a pre-trained DGM. Our method can be applied to normalizing flows and score-based diffusion models, and obtains results which match or surpass state-of-the-art OOD detection benchmarks using the same DGM backbones. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/dgm_ood_detection.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18920">CPR: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Copyright Protection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Golatkar, Alessandro Achille, Luca Zancato, Yu-Xiang Wang, Ashwin Swaminathan, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a flexible and robust technique to adapt models to private users data without training, to handle credit attribution, and to allow efficient machine unlearning at scale. However, RAG techniques for image generation may lead to parts of the retrieved samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private information contained in the retrieved set, we introduce Copy-Protected generation with Retrieval (CPR), a new method for RAG with strong copyright protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models.CPR allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved images, while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular, it does so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user) distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two algorithms for copyright protection, CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods, our methods enable efficient copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP. In particular, we empirically show that applying CPR on top of unCLIP improves quality and text-to-image alignment of the generated results (81.4 to 83.17 on TIFA benchmark), while enabling credit attribution, copy-right protection, and deterministic, constant time, unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runlong Yu, Robert Ladwig, Xiang Xu, Peijun Zhu, Paul C. Hanson, Yiqun Xie, Xiaowei Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in north temperate lakes requires a comprehensive study of phenological patterns across various ecosystems, which highlights the significance of selecting phenological features and feature interactions. Process-based models are limited by partial process knowledge or oversimplified feature representations, while machine learning models face challenges in efficiently selecting relevant feature interactions for different lake types and tasks, especially under the infrequent nature of DO data collection. In this paper, we propose a Nature-Guided Cognitive Evolution (NGCE) strategy, which represents a multi-level fusion of adaptive learning with natural processes. Specifically, we utilize metabolic process-based models to generate simulated DO labels. Using these simulated labels, we implement a multi-population cognitive evolutionary search, where models, mirroring natural organisms, adaptively evolve to select relevant feature interactions within populations for different lake types and tasks. These models are not only capable of undergoing crossover and mutation mechanisms within intra-populations but also, albeit infrequently, engage in inter-population crossover. The second stage involves refining these models by retraining them with real observed labels. We have tested the performance of our NGCE strategy in predicting daily DO concentrations across a wide range of lakes in the Midwest, USA. These lakes, varying in size, depth, and trophic status, represent a broad spectrum of north temperate lakes. Our findings demonstrate that NGCE not only produces accurate predictions with few observed labels but also, through gene maps of models, reveals sophisticated phenological patterns of different lakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yejin Bang, Delong Chen, Nayeon Lee, Pascale Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose to measure political bias in LLMs by analyzing both the content and style of their generated content regarding political issues. Existing benchmarks and measures focus on gender and racial biases. However, political bias exists in LLMs and can lead to polarization and other harms in downstream applications. In order to provide transparency to users, we advocate that there should be fine-grained and explainable measures of political biases generated by LLMs. Our proposed measure looks at different political issues such as reproductive rights and climate change, at both the content (the substance of the generation) and the style (the lexical polarity) of such bias. We measured the political bias in eleven open-sourced LLMs and showed that our proposed framework is easily scalable to other topics and is explainable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Bergomi, Tommaso M. Buonocore, Paolo Antonazzo, Lorenzo Alberghi, Riccardo Bellazzi, Lorenzo Preda, Chandra Bortolotto, Enea Parimbelli</p>
<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiology reports are typically written in a free-text format, making clinical information difficult to extract and use. Recently the adoption of structured reporting (SR) has been recommended by various medical societies thanks to the advantages it offers, e.g. standardization, completeness and information retrieval. We propose a pipeline to extract information from free-text radiology reports, that fits with the items of the reference SR registry proposed by a national society of interventional and medical radiology, focusing on CT staging of patients with lymphoma. METHODS: Our work aims to leverage the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based models to deal with automatic SR registry filling. With the availability of 174 radiology reports, we investigate a rule-free generative Question Answering approach based on a domain-specific version of T5 (IT5). Two strategies (batch-truncation and ex-post combination) are implemented to comply with the model's context length limitations. Performance is evaluated in terms of strict accuracy, F1, and format accuracy, and compared with the widely used GPT-3.5 Large Language Model. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire is used to collect human-expert feedback on the similarity between medical annotations and generated answers. RESULTS: The combination of fine-tuning and batch splitting allows IT5 to achieve notable results; it performs on par with GPT-3.5 albeit its size being a thousand times smaller in terms of parameters. Human-based assessment scores show a high correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficients>0.88, p-values<0.001) with AI performance metrics (F1) and confirm the superior ability of LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5, 175B of parameters) in generating plausible human-like statements.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18946">Random Aggregate Beamforming for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Large-Scale Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunmei Xu, Shengheng Liu, Yongming Huang, Bjorn Ottersten, Dusit Niyato</p>
<p>Abstract: At present, there is a trend to deploy ubiquitous artificial intelligence (AI) applications at the edge of the network. As a promising framework that enables secure edge intelligence, federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention, and over-the-air computing (AirComp) has been integrated to further improve the communication efficiency. In this paper, we consider a joint device selection and aggregate beamforming design with the objectives of minimizing the aggregate error and maximizing the number of selected devices. This yields a combinatorial problem, which is difficult to solve especially in large-scale networks. To tackle the problems in a cost-effective manner, we propose a random aggregate beamforming-based scheme, which generates the aggregator beamforming vector via random sampling rather than optimization. The implementation of the proposed scheme does not require the channel estimation. We additionally use asymptotic analysis to study the obtained aggregate error and the number of the selected devices when the number of devices becomes large. Furthermore, a refined method that runs with multiple randomizations is also proposed for performance improvement. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed random aggregate beamforming-based scheme as well as the refined method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel A. Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. An essentially completely unexplored topic is the use of quantum algorithms and computing to explore and ask questions \textit{about} the functional dynamics of neural networks. This is a component of the still-nascent topic of applying quantum computing to the modeling and simulations of biological and artificial neural networks. In this work, we show how a carefully constructed set of conditions can use two foundational quantum algorithms, Grover and Deutsch-Josza, in such a way that the output measurements admit an interpretation that guarantees we can infer if a simple representation of a neural network (which applies to both biological and artificial networks) after some period of time has the potential to continue sustaining dynamic activity. Or whether the dynamics are guaranteed to stop either through 'epileptic' dynamics or quiescence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Ye, Feng Tao, Abhirup Mallik, Burhaneddin Yaman, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) based autonomous driving has emerged as a promising alternative to data-driven imitation learning approaches. However, crafting effective reward functions for RL poses challenges due to the complexity of defining and quantifying good driving behaviors across diverse scenarios. Recently, large pretrained models have gained significant attention as zero-shot reward models for tasks specified with desired linguistic goals. However, the desired linguistic goals for autonomous driving such as "drive safely" are ambiguous and incomprehensible by pretrained models. On the other hand, undesired linguistic goals like "collision" are more concrete and tractable. In this work, we introduce LORD, a novel large models based opposite reward design through undesired linguistic goals to enable the efficient use of large pretrained models as zero-shot reward models. Through extensive experiments, our proposed framework shows its efficiency in leveraging the power of large pretrained models for achieving safe and enhanced autonomous driving. Moreover, the proposed approach shows improved generalization capabilities as it outperforms counterpart methods across diverse and challenging driving scenarios.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18976">&quot;Sorry, Come Again?&quot; Prompting -- Enhancing Comprehension and Diminishing Hallucination with [PAUSE]-injected Optimal Paraphrasing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vipula Rawte, S. M Towhidul Islam Tonmoy, S M Mehedi Zaman, Prachi Priya, Aman Chadha, Amit P. Sheth, Amitava Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination has emerged as the most vulnerable aspect of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce the Sorry, Come Again (SCA) prompting, aimed to avoid LLM hallucinations by enhancing comprehension through: (i) optimal paraphrasing and (ii) injecting [PAUSE] tokens to delay LLM generation. First, we provide an in-depth analysis of linguistic nuances: formality, readability, and concreteness of prompts for 21 LLMs, and elucidate how these nuances contribute to hallucinated generation. Prompts with lower readability, formality, or concreteness pose comprehension challenges for LLMs, similar to those faced by humans. In such scenarios, an LLM tends to speculate and generate content based on its imagination (associative memory) to fill these information gaps. Although these speculations may occasionally align with factual information, their accuracy is not assured, often resulting in hallucination. Recent studies reveal that an LLM often neglects the middle sections of extended prompts, a phenomenon termed as lost in the middle. While a specific paraphrase may suit one LLM, the same paraphrased version may elicit a different response from another LLM. Therefore, we propose an optimal paraphrasing technique to identify the most comprehensible paraphrase of a given prompt, evaluated using Integrated Gradient (and its variations) to guarantee that the LLM accurately processes all words. While reading lengthy sentences, humans often pause at various points to better comprehend the meaning read thus far. We have fine-tuned an LLM with injected [PAUSE] tokens, allowing the LLM to pause while reading lengthier prompts. This has brought several key contributions: (i) determining the optimal position to inject [PAUSE], (ii) determining the number of [PAUSE] tokens to be inserted, and (iii) introducing reverse proxy tuning to fine-tune the LLM for [PAUSE] insertion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyu Li, Xian Liu, Anil Kag, Ju Hu, Yerlan Idelbayev, Dhritiman Sagar, Yanzhi Wang, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, have revolutionized the field of content generation, enabling significant advancements in areas like image editing and video synthesis. Despite their formidable capabilities, these models are not without their limitations. It is still challenging to synthesize an image that aligns well with the input text, and multiple runs with carefully crafted prompts are required to achieve satisfactory results. To mitigate these limitations, numerous studies have endeavored to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models, i.e., UNet, utilizing various technologies. Yet, amidst these efforts, a pivotal question of text-to-image diffusion model training has remained largely unexplored: Is it possible and feasible to fine-tune the text encoder to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models? Our findings reveal that, instead of replacing the CLIP text encoder used in Stable Diffusion with other large language models, we can enhance it through our proposed fine-tuning approach, TextCraftor, leading to substantial improvements in quantitative benchmarks and human assessments. Interestingly, our technique also empowers controllable image generation through the interpolation of different text encoders fine-tuned with various rewards. We also demonstrate that TextCraftor is orthogonal to UNet finetuning, and can be combined to further improve generative quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Atuhurra, Takanori Hara, Yuanyu Zhang, Masahiro Sasabe, Shoji Kasahara</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapidly spreading usage of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) plays an important role in detecting and protecting various types of attacks in the IoT network. To evaluate the robustness of the NIDS in the IoT network, the existing work proposed a realistic botnet dataset in the IoT network (Bot-IoT dataset) and applied it to machine learning-based anomaly detection. This dataset contains imbalanced normal and attack packets because the number of normal packets is much smaller than that of attack ones. The nature of imbalanced data may make it difficult to identify the minority class correctly. In this thesis, to address the class imbalance problem in the Bot-IoT dataset, we propose a binary classification method with synthetic minority over-sampling techniques (SMOTE). The proposed classifier aims to detect attack packets and overcome the class imbalance problem using the SMOTE algorithm. Through numerical results, we demonstrate the proposed classifier's fundamental characteristics and the impact of imbalanced data on its performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Wang, Mika V. Mantyl\"a, Serge Demeyer, Mutlu Beyazit, Joanna Kisaakye, Jesse Nyyss\"ol\"a</p>
<p>Abstract: Microservice-based systems (MSS) may experience failures in various fault categories due to their complex and dynamic nature. To effectively handle failures, AIOps tools utilize trace-based anomaly detection and root cause analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for few-shot abnormal trace classification for MSS. Our framework comprises two main components: (1) Multi-Head Attention Autoencoder for constructing system-specific trace representations, which enables (2) Transformer Encoder-based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to perform effective and efficient few-shot learning for abnormal trace classification. The proposed framework is evaluated on two representative MSS, Trainticket and OnlineBoutique, with open datasets. The results show that our framework can adapt the learned knowledge to classify new, unseen abnormal traces of novel fault categories both within the same system it was initially trained on and even in the different MSS. Within the same MSS, our framework achieves an average accuracy of 93.26\% and 85.2\% across 50 meta-testing tasks for Trainticket and OnlineBoutique, respectively, when provided with 10 instances for each task. In a cross-system context, our framework gets an average accuracy of 92.19\% and 84.77\% for the same meta-testing tasks of the respective system, also with 10 instances provided for each task. Our work demonstrates the applicability of achieving few-shot abnormal trace classification for MSS and shows how it can enable cross-system adaptability. This opens an avenue for building more generalized AIOps tools that require less system-specific data labeling for anomaly detection and root cause analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Tan, Shuyuan Xu, Wenyue Hua, Yingqiang Ge, Zelong Li, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the traditional ranking-based recommendation style into a text-to-text generation paradigm. However, in contrast to standard NLP tasks that inherently operate on human vocabulary, current research in generative recommendations struggles to effectively encode recommendation items within the text-to-text framework using concise yet meaningful ID representations. To better align LLMs with recommendation needs, we propose IDGen, representing each item as a unique, concise, semantically rich, platform-agnostic textual ID using human language tokens. This is achieved by training a textual ID generator alongside the LLM-based recommender, enabling seamless integration of personalized recommendations into natural language generation. Notably, as user history is expressed in natural language and decoupled from the original dataset, our approach suggests the potential for a foundational generative recommendation model. Experiments show that our framework consistently surpasses existing models in sequential recommendation under standard experimental setting. Then, we explore the possibility of training a foundation recommendation model with the proposed method on data collected from 19 different datasets and tested its recommendation performance on 6 unseen datasets across different platforms under a completely zero-shot setting. The results show that the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained foundation model is comparable to or even better than some traditional recommendation models based on supervised training, showing the potential of the IDGen paradigm serving as the foundation model for generative recommendation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin Sonmez, Neelay Junnarkar, Murat Arcak</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has leveraged symmetries in the model to improve sample efficiency in training a policy. A commonly used simplifying assumption is that the dynamics and reward both exhibit the same symmetry. However, in many real-world environments, the dynamical model exhibits symmetry independent of the reward model: the reward may not satisfy the same symmetries as the dynamics. In this paper, we investigate scenarios where only the dynamics are assumed to exhibit symmetry, extending the scope of problems in reinforcement learning and learning in control theory where symmetry techniques can be applied. We use Cartan's moving frame method to introduce a technique for learning dynamics which, by construction, exhibit specified symmetries. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the proposed method learns a more accurate dynamical model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Guo, Anthony Ovadje, Mohammed Ali Al-Garadi, Abeed Sarker</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in NLP tasks. However, there is a paucity of studies that attempt to evaluate their performances on social media-based health-related natural language processing tasks, which have traditionally been difficult to achieve high scores in. We benchmarked one supervised classic machine learning model based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), three supervised pretrained language models (PLMs) based on RoBERTa, BERTweet, and SocBERT, and two LLM based classifiers (GPT3.5 and GPT4), across 6 text classification tasks. We developed three approaches for leveraging LLMs for text classification: employing LLMs as zero-shot classifiers, us-ing LLMs as annotators to annotate training data for supervised classifiers, and utilizing LLMs with few-shot examples for augmentation of manually annotated data. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that employ-ing data augmentation using LLMs (GPT-4) with relatively small human-annotated data to train lightweight supervised classification models achieves superior results compared to training with human-annotated data alone. Supervised learners also outperform GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in zero-shot settings. By leveraging this data augmentation strategy, we can harness the power of LLMs to develop smaller, more effective domain-specific NLP models. LLM-annotated data without human guidance for training light-weight supervised classification models is an ineffective strategy. However, LLM, as a zero-shot classifier, shows promise in excluding false negatives and potentially reducing the human effort required for data annotation. Future investigations are imperative to explore optimal training data sizes and the optimal amounts of augmented data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> De-An Huang, Shijia Liao, Subhashree Radhakrishnan, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov, Zhiding Yu, Jan Kautz</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent works have extended these models to video input with promising instruction following capabilities. However, an important missing piece is temporal localization. These models cannot accurately answer the "When?" questions. We identify three key aspects that limit their temporal localization capabilities: (i) time representation, (ii) architecture, and (iii) data. We address these shortcomings by proposing Language Instructed Temporal-Localization Assistant (LITA) with the following features: (1) We introduce time tokens that encode timestamps relative to the video length to better represent time in videos. (2) We introduce SlowFast tokens in the architecture to capture temporal information at fine temporal resolution. (3) We emphasize temporal localization data for LITA. In addition to leveraging existing video datasets with timestamps, we propose a new task, Reasoning Temporal Localization (RTL), along with the dataset, ActivityNet-RTL, for learning and evaluating this task. Reasoning temporal localization requires both the reasoning and temporal localization of Video LLMs. LITA demonstrates strong performance on this challenging task, nearly doubling the temporal mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of baselines. In addition, we show that our emphasis on temporal localization also substantially improves video-based text generation compared to existing Video LLMs, including a 36% relative improvement of Temporal Understanding.

<p>Abstract: The astonishing development of single-photon cameras has created an unprecedented opportunity for scientific and industrial imaging. However, the high data throughput generated by these 1-bit sensors creates a significant bottleneck for low-power applications. In this paper, we explore the possibility of generating a color image from a single binary frame of a single-photon camera. We evidently find this problem being particularly difficult to standard colorization approaches due to the substantial degree of exposure variation. The core innovation of our paper is an exposure synthesis model framed under a neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE) that allows us to generate a continuum of exposures from a single observation. This innovation ensures consistent exposure in binary images that colorizers take on, resulting in notably enhanced colorization. We demonstrate applications of the method in single-image and burst colorization and show superior generative performance over baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Sharma, Gaurav Narang, Janardhan Rao Doppa, Umit Ogras, Partha Pratim Pande</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as an enabler for the energy-efficient and high-performance acceleration of deep learning (DL) workloads. Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is one of the most promising technologies to implement PIM. However, as the complexity of Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) grows, we need to design a manycore architecture with multiple ReRAM-based processing elements (PEs) on a single chip. Existing PIM-based architectures mostly focus on computation while ignoring the role of communication. ReRAM-based tiled manycore architectures often involve many Processing Elements (PEs), which need to be interconnected via an efficient on-chip communication infrastructure. Simply allocating more resources (ReRAMs) to speed up only computation is ineffective if the communication infrastructure cannot keep up with it. In this paper, we highlight the design principles of a dataflow-aware PIM-enabled manycore platform tailor-made for various types of DL workloads. We consider the design challenges with both 2.5D interposer- and 3D integration-enabled architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Lin, Ligeng Zhu, Wei-Ming Chen, Wei-Chen Wang, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is a new frontier of machine learning. By squeezing deep learning models into billions of IoT devices and microcontrollers (MCUs), we expand the scope of AI applications and enable ubiquitous intelligence. However, TinyML is challenging due to hardware constraints: the tiny memory resource makes it difficult to hold deep learning models designed for cloud and mobile platforms. There is also limited compiler and inference engine support for bare-metal devices. Therefore, we need to co-design the algorithm and system stack to enable TinyML. In this review, we will first discuss the definition, challenges, and applications of TinyML. We then survey the recent progress in TinyML and deep learning on MCUs. Next, we will introduce MCUNet, showing how we can achieve ImageNet-scale AI applications on IoT devices with system-algorithm co-design. We will further extend the solution from inference to training and introduce tiny on-device training techniques. Finally, we present future directions in this area. Today's large model might be tomorrow's tiny model. The scope of TinyML should evolve and adapt over time.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19078">MVEB: Self-Supervised Learning with Multi-View Entropy Bottleneck</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangjian Wen, Xiasi Wang, Jianzhuang Liu, Zenglin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn representation that can be effectively generalized to downstream tasks. Many self-supervised approaches regard two views of an image as both the input and the self-supervised signals, assuming that either view contains the same task-relevant information and the shared information is (approximately) sufficient for predicting downstream tasks. Recent studies show that discarding superfluous information not shared between the views can improve generalization. Hence, the ideal representation is sufficient for downstream tasks and contains minimal superfluous information, termed minimal sufficient representation. One can learn this representation by maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the supervised view while eliminating superfluous information. Nevertheless, the computation of mutual information is notoriously intractable. In this work, we propose an objective termed multi-view entropy bottleneck (MVEB) to learn minimal sufficient representation effectively. MVEB simplifies the minimal sufficient learning to maximizing both the agreement between the embeddings of two views and the differential entropy of the embedding distribution. Our experiments confirm that MVEB significantly improves performance. For example, it achieves top-1 accuracy of 76.9\% on ImageNet with a vanilla ResNet-50 backbone on linear evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the new state-of-the-art result with ResNet-50.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) serves as a robust framework that quantifies uncertainty in predictions made by Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike traditional point predictors, CP generates statistically valid prediction regions, also known as prediction intervals, based on the assumption of data exchangeability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishuai Cai, Shaowu Yang, Minglong Li, Xinglin Chen, Yunxin Mao, Xiaodong Yi, Wenjing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing the morphologies and the controllers that adapt to various tasks is a critical issue in the field of robot design, aka. embodied intelligence. Previous works typically model it as a joint optimization problem and use search-based methods to find the optimal solution in the morphology space. However, they ignore the implicit knowledge of task-to-morphology mapping which can directly inspire robot design. For example, flipping heavier boxes tends to require more muscular robot arms. This paper proposes a novel and general differentiable task-inspired framework for contact-aware robot design called Task2Morph. We abstract task features highly related to task performance and use them to build a task-to-morphology mapping. Further, we embed the mapping into a differentiable robot design process, where the gradient information is leveraged for both the mapping learning and the whole optimization. The experiments are conducted on three scenarios, and the results validate that Task2Morph outperforms DiffHand, which lacks a task-inspired morphology module, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19101">AAPMT: AGI Assessment Through Prompt and Metric Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benhao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of text-to-image models marks a significant milestone in the evolution of AI-generated images (AGIs), expanding their use in diverse domains like design, entertainment, and more. Despite these breakthroughs, the quality of AGIs often remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for effective evaluation methods. These methods are crucial for assessing the quality of images relative to their textual descriptions, and they must accurately mirror human perception. Substantial progress has been achieved in this domain, with innovative techniques such as BLIP and DBCNN contributing significantly. However, recent studies, including AGIQA-3K, reveal a notable discrepancy between current methods and state-of-the-art (SOTA) standards. This gap emphasizes the necessity for a more sophisticated and precise evaluation metric. In response, our objective is to develop a model that could give ratings for metrics, which focuses on parameters like perceptual quality, authenticity, and the correspondence between text and image, that more closely aligns with human perception. In our paper, we introduce a range of effective methods, including prompt designs and the Metric Transformer. The Metric Transformer is a novel structure inspired by the complex interrelationships among various AGI quality metrics.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19103">Automated Black-box Prompt Engineering for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong He, Alexander Robey, Naoki Murata, Yiding Jiang, Joshua Williams, George J. Pappas, Hamed Hassani, Yuki Mitsufuji, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is effective for controlling the output of text-to-image (T2I) generative models, but it is also laborious due to the need for manually crafted prompts. This challenge has spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, and produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically identifies human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompts distribution for given reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19113">FACTOID: FACtual enTailment fOr hallucInation Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vipula Rawte, S. M Towhidul Islam Tonmoy, Krishnav Rajbangshi, Shravani Nag, Aman Chadha, Amit P. Sheth, Amitava Das</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated numerous benefits. However, hallucination is a significant concern. In response, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly promising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual information. RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check if the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to retrieved documents. This paper argues that conventional TE methods are inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs. For instance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. The AI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not put troops in Ukraine...'' However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe Biden which contradicts factual reality. Moreover, current TE systems are unable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion that is contradicted. To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called ``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that contradicts reality. We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation Detection), a benchmark dataset for FE. We propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for FE, incorporating state-of-the-art (SoTA) long text embeddings such as e5-mistral-7b-instruct, along with GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer. The proposed MTL architecture for FE achieves an avg. 40\% improvement in accuracy on the FACTOID benchmark compared to SoTA TE methods. As FE automatically detects hallucinations, we assessed 15 modern LLMs and ranked them using our proposed Auto Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI_auto). This index quantifies and offers a comparative scale to evaluate and rank LLMs according to their hallucinations.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19116">MFORT-QA: Multi-hop Few-shot Open Rich Table Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Che Guan, Mengyu Huang, Peng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's fast-paced industry, professionals face the challenge of summarizing a large number of documents and extracting vital information from them on a daily basis. These metrics are frequently hidden away in tables and/or their nested hyperlinks. To address this challenge, the approach of Table Question Answering (QA) has been developed to extract the relevant information. However, traditional Table QA training tasks that provide a table and an answer(s) from a gold cell coordinate(s) for a question may not always ensure extracting the accurate answer(s). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for extracting information from tabular data using prompts. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-hop Few-shot Open Rich Table QA (MFORT-QA) approach, which consists of two major steps. The first step involves Few-Shot Learning (FSL), where relevant tables and associated contexts of hyperlinks are retrieved based on a given question. The retrieved content is then used to construct few-shot prompts as inputs to an LLM, such as ChatGPT. To tackle the challenge of answering complex questions, the second step leverages Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to decompose the complex question into a sequential chain of questions and reasoning thoughts in a multi-hop manner. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances this process by retrieving relevant tables and contexts of hyperlinks that are relevant to the resulting reasoning thoughts and questions. These additional contexts are then used to supplement the prompt used in the first step, resulting in more accurate answers from an LLM. Empirical results from OTT-QA demonstrate that our abstractive QA approach significantly improves the accuracy of extractive Table QA methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19135">Compressing Large Language Models by Streamlining the Unimportant Layer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have been extensively applied in various natural language tasks and domains, but their applicability is constrained by the large number of parameters of the models. Consequently, there is an increasing emphasis on compact models that exhibit high performance. In this study, we observe that different layers in LLM have varying degrees of perturbation on the hidden states, which allows us to identify less important layers. Based on this phenomenon, we propose LLM-Streamline, which consists of two parts: layer pruning, where we remove a set of consecutive layers with the lowest importance in the model according to the target sparsity; and layer replacement, where we train a lightweight model to substitute the pruned layers, thereby mitigating the performance degradation caused by pruning. In our experiments, we utilize structures such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a transformer layer as lightweight models and ultimately demonstrate that a single MLP can effectively fit the pruned layers. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method, LLM-Streamline, outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model pruning methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19140">QNCD: Quantization Noise Correction for Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanpeng Chu, Wei Wu, Chengjie Zang, Kun Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, setting new benchmarks in quality and creativity. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the intensive computation required during the iterative denoising process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a solution to accelerate sampling, aibeit at the expense of sample quality, extremely in low-bit settings. Addressing this, our study introduces a unified Quantization Noise Correction Scheme (QNCD), aimed at minishing quantization noise throughout the sampling process. We identify two primary quantization challenges: intra and inter quantization noise. Intra quantization noise, mainly exacerbated by embeddings in the resblock module, extends activation quantization ranges, increasing disturbances in each single denosing step. Besides, inter quantization noise stems from cumulative quantization deviations across the entire denoising process, altering data distributions step-by-step. QNCD combats these through embedding-derived feature smoothing for eliminating intra quantization noise and an effective runtime noise estimatiation module for dynamicly filtering inter quantization noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous quantization methods for diffusion models, achieving lossless results in W4A8 and W8A8 quantization settings on ImageNet (LDM-4).

Vu (British University Vietnam), Darius Postma (British University Vietnam), Don Hickerson (British University Vietnam), James McGaughran (British University Vietnam), Huy Q. Khuat (British University Vietnam)</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of six major Generative AI (GenAI) text detectors when confronted with machine-generated content that has been modified using techniques designed to evade detection by these tools (n=805). The results demonstrate that the detectors' already low accuracy rates (39.5%) show major reductions in accuracy (17.4%) when faced with manipulated content, with some techniques proving more effective than others in evading detection.
  The accuracy limitations and the potential for false accusations demonstrate that these tools cannot currently be recommended for determining whether violations of academic integrity have occurred, underscoring the challenges educators face in maintaining inclusive and fair assessment practices. However, they may have a role in supporting student learning and maintaining academic integrity when used in a non-punitive manner.
  These results underscore the need for a combined approach to addressing the challenges posed by GenAI in academia to promote the responsible and equitable use of these emerging technologies. The study concludes that the current limitations of AI text detectors require a critical approach for any possible implementation in HE and highlight possible alternatives to AI assessment strategies.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19150">Towards Understanding Dual BN In Hybrid Adversarial Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenshuang Zhang, Chaoning Zhang, Kang Zhang, Axi Niu, Junmo Kim, In So Kweon</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing concern about applying batch normalization (BN) in adversarial training (AT), especially when the model is trained on both adversarial samples and clean samples (termed Hybrid-AT). With the assumption that adversarial and clean samples are from two different domains, a common practice in prior works is to adopt Dual BN, where BN and BN are used for adversarial and clean branches, respectively. A popular belief for motivating Dual BN is that estimating normalization statistics of this mixture distribution is challenging and thus disentangling it for normalization achieves stronger robustness. In contrast to this belief, we reveal that disentangling statistics plays a less role than disentangling affine parameters in model training. This finding aligns with prior work (Rebuffi et al., 2023), and we build upon their research for further investigations. We demonstrate that the domain gap between adversarial and clean samples is not very large, which is counter-intuitive considering the significant influence of adversarial perturbation on the model accuracy. We further propose a two-task hypothesis which serves as the empirical foundation and a unified framework for Hybrid-AT improvement. We also investigate Dual BN in test-time and reveal that affine parameters characterize the robustness during inference. Overall, our work sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of Dual BN in Hybrid-AT and its underlying justification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmaya Andukuri, Jan-Philipp Fr\"anken, Tobias Gerstenberg, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: When prompting language models to complete a task, users often leave important aspects unsaid. While asking questions could resolve this ambiguity \citep[GATE;][]{li2023eliciting}, models often struggle to ask good questions. We explore a language model's ability to self-improve \citep[STaR;][]{zelikman2022star} by rewarding the model for generating useful questions -- a simple method we dub STaR-GATE. We generate a synthetic dataset of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts to simulate conversations between a pretrained language model -- the \texttt{Questioner} -- and a \texttt{Roleplayer} whose preferences are unknown to the \texttt{Questioner}. By asking questions, the \texttt{Questioner} elicits preferences from the \texttt{Roleplayer}. The \texttt{Questioner} is iteratively finetuned on questions that increase the probability of high-quality responses to the task, which are generated by an \texttt{Oracle} with access to the \texttt{Roleplayer}'s latent preferences. After two iterations of self-improvement, the \texttt{Questioner} asks better questions, allowing it to generate responses that are preferred over responses from the initial model on \highlightpink{\textbf{72\%}} of tasks. Our results indicate that teaching a language model to ask better questions leads to better personalized responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have manifested remarkable capabilities by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques to solve intricate questions through step-by-step reasoning chains. Despite its success, the efficacy of such reasoning is inherently contingent upon the quality of CoT. However, flawless CoT reasoning cannot be guaranteed due to the presence of indecomposable questions and the potential for erroneous reasoning chains, particularly in the case of small-scale language models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the selective filtering reasoner (SelF-Reasoner) that assesses the entailment relationship between the question and the candidate reasoning chain. Then, we proceed with CoT reasoning when the reasoning chain demonstrates confidence; otherwise, we opt to predict the answer directly. SelF-Reasoner improves the fine-tuned T5 baseline consistently over the ScienceQA, ECQA, and LastLetter tasks. Code is available at \texttt{https://github.com/LibroWu/SelF-Reasoner}.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19177">Rethinking Information Loss in Medical Image Segmentation with Various-sized Targets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Liu, Zhaorui Tan, Kaizhu Huang, Haochuan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation presents the challenge of segmenting various-size targets, demanding the model to effectively capture both local and global information. Despite recent efforts using CNNs and ViTs to predict annotations of different scales, these approaches often struggle to effectively balance the detection of targets across varying sizes. Simply utilizing local information from CNNs and global relationships from ViTs without considering potential significant divergence in latent feature distributions may result in substantial information loss. To address this issue, in this paper, we will introduce a novel Stagger Network (SNet) and argues that a well-designed fusion structure can mitigate the divergence in latent feature distributions between CNNs and ViTs, thereby reducing information loss. Specifically, to emphasize both global dependencies and local focus, we design a Parallel Module to bridge the semantic gap. Meanwhile, we propose the Stagger Module, trying to fuse the selected features that are more semantically similar. An Information Recovery Module is further adopted to recover complementary information back to the network. As a key contribution, we theoretically analyze that the proposed parallel and stagger strategies would lead to less information loss, thus certifying the SNet's rationale. Experimental results clearly proved that the proposed SNet excels comparisons with recent SOTAs in segmenting on the Synapse dataset where targets are in various sizes. Besides, it also demonstrates superiority on the ACDC and the MoNuSeg datasets where targets are with more consistent dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Liu, Chunlu Chen, Yu Li, Lin Sun, Yulun Song, Jingbo Zhou, Bo Jing, Dejing Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: While centralized servers pose a risk of being a single point of failure, decentralized approaches like blockchain offer a compelling solution by implementing a consensus mechanism among multiple entities. Merging distributed computing with cryptographic techniques, decentralized technologies introduce a novel computing paradigm. Blockchain ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data management by validating and recording transactions via consensus across network nodes. Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning framework, enables participants to collaboratively train models while safeguarding data privacy by avoiding direct raw data exchange. Despite the growing interest in decentralized methods, their application in FL remains underexplored. This paper presents a thorough investigation into Blockchain-based FL (BCFL), spotlighting the synergy between blockchain's security features and FL's privacy-preserving model training capabilities. First, we present the taxonomy of BCFL from three aspects, including decentralized, separate networks, and reputation-based architectures. Then, we summarize the general architecture of BCFL systems, providing a comprehensive perspective on FL architectures informed by blockchain. Afterward, we analyze the application of BCFL in healthcare, IoT, and other privacy-sensitive areas. Finally, we identify future research directions of BCFL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Yang, Guodong Long, Tao Shen, Jing Jiang, Michael Blumenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts. To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model. Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sishuo Chen, Lei Li, Shuhuai Ren, Rundong Gao, Yuanxin Liu, Xiaohan Bi, Xu Sun, Lu Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Video paragraph captioning (VPC) involves generating detailed narratives for long videos, utilizing supportive modalities such as speech and event boundaries. However, the existing models are constrained by the assumption of constant availability of a single auxiliary modality, which is impractical given the diversity and unpredictable nature of real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a Missing-Resistant framework MR-VPC that effectively harnesses all available auxiliary inputs and maintains resilience even in the absence of certain modalities. Under this framework, we propose the Multimodal VPC (MVPC) architecture integrating video, speech, and event boundary inputs in a unified manner to process various auxiliary inputs. Moreover, to fortify the model against incomplete data, we introduce DropAM, a data augmentation strategy that randomly omits auxiliary inputs, paired with DistillAM, a regularization target that distills knowledge from teacher models trained on modality-complete data, enabling efficient learning in modality-deficient environments. Through exhaustive experimentation on YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions, MR-VPC has proven to deliver superior performance on modality-complete and modality-missing test data. This work highlights the significance of developing resilient VPC models and paves the way for more adaptive, robust multimodal video understanding.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19238">Taming Lookup Tables for Efficient Image Retouching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sidi Yang, Binxiao Huang, Mingdeng Cao, Yatai Ji, Hanzhong Guo, Ngai Wong, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of high-definition screens in edge devices, such as end-user cameras, smartphones, and televisions, is spurring a significant demand for image enhancement. Existing enhancement models often optimize for high performance while falling short of reducing hardware inference time and power consumption, especially on edge devices with constrained computing and storage resources. To this end, we propose Image Color Enhancement Lookup Table (ICELUT) that adopts LUTs for extremely efficient edge inference, without any convolutional neural network (CNN). During training, we leverage pointwise (1x1) convolution to extract color information, alongside a split fully connected layer to incorporate global information. Both components are then seamlessly converted into LUTs for hardware-agnostic deployment. ICELUT achieves near-state-of-the-art performance and remarkably low power consumption. We observe that the pointwise network structure exhibits robust scalability, upkeeping the performance even with a heavily downsampled 32x32 input image. These enable ICELUT, the first-ever purely LUT-based image enhancer, to reach an unprecedented speed of 0.4ms on GPU and 7ms on CPU, at least one order faster than any CNN solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianhao Yu, Jiaqi Fu, Renjia Deng, Wenjuan Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional multi-agent simulators often assume perfect information and limitless capabilities, hindering the ecological validity of social interactions. We propose a multi-agent Minecraft simulator, MineLand, that bridges this gap by introducing limited multimodal senses and physical needs. Our simulator supports up to 48 agents with limited visual, auditory, and environmental awareness, forcing them to actively communicate and collaborate to fulfill physical needs like food and resources. This fosters dynamic and valid multi-agent interactions. We further introduce an AI agent framework, Alex, inspired by multitasking theory, enabling agents to handle intricate coordination and scheduling. Our experiments demonstrate that the simulator, the corresponding benchmark, and the AI agent framework contribute to more ecological and nuanced collective behavior. The source code of MineLand and Alex is openly available at https://github.com/cocacola-lab/MineLand.</p>

<p>Abstract: As development of large language models (LLM) progresses, aligning them with human preferences has become increasingly important. We propose stepwise DPO (sDPO), an extension of the recently popularized direct preference optimization (DPO) for alignment tuning. This approach involves dividing the available preference datasets and utilizing them in a stepwise manner, rather than employing it all at once. We demonstrate that this method facilitates the use of more precisely aligned reference models within the DPO training framework. Furthermore, sDPO trains the final model to be more performant, even outperforming other popular LLMs with more parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Guerriero, Roberto Pietrantuono, Stefano Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are core components for classification and regression tasks of many software systems. Companies incur in high costs for testing DNN with datasets representative of the inputs expected in operation, as these need to be manually labelled. The challenge is to select a representative set of test inputs as small as possible to reduce the labelling cost, while sufficing to yield unbiased high-confidence estimates of the expected DNN accuracy. At the same time, testers are interested in exposing as many DNN mispredictions as possible to improve the DNN, ending up in the need for techniques pursuing a threefold aim: small dataset size, trustworthy estimates, mispredictions exposure. This study presents DeepSample, a family of DNN testing techniques for cost-effective accuracy assessment based on probabilistic sampling. We investigate whether, to what extent, and under which conditions probabilistic sampling can help to tackle the outlined challenge. We implement five new sampling-based testing techniques, and perform a comprehensive comparison of such techniques and of three further state-of-the-art techniques for both DNN classification and regression tasks. Results serve as guidance for best use of sampling-based testing for faithful and high-confidence estimates of DNN accuracy in operation at low cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of an intelligent agricultural decision-supporting system for crop selection and disease forecasting in Bangladesh is the main objective of this work. The economy of the nation depends heavily on agriculture. However, choosing crops with better production rates and efficiently controlling crop disease are obstacles that farmers have to face. These issues are addressed in this research by utilizing machine learning methods and real-world datasets. The recommended approach uses a variety of datasets on the production of crops, soil conditions, agro-meteorological regions, crop disease, and meteorological factors. These datasets offer insightful information on disease trends, soil nutrition demand of crops, and agricultural production history. By incorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily selected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then the predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used to forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by utilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use of the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a final crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the outcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as prevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions. Consequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers can predict possible crop yields. Overall, by offering a detailed decision support system for crop selection and disease prediction, this work can play a vital role in advancing agricultural practices in Bangladesh.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Zhou, Liang Pang, Ya Jing, Jia Gu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing personalized and anthropomorphic agents holds significant importance in the simulation of social networks. However, there are still two key problems in existing works: the agent possesses world knowledge that does not belong to its personas, and it cannot eliminate the interference of diverse persona information on current actions, which reduces the personalization and anthropomorphism of the agent. To solve the above problems, we construct the social media agent based on personalized knowledge and dynamic persona information. For personalized knowledge, we add external knowledge sources and match them with the persona information of agents, thereby giving the agent personalized world knowledge. For dynamic persona information, we use current action information to internally retrieve the persona information of the agent, thereby reducing the interference of diverse persona information on the current action. To make the agent suitable for social media, we design five basic modules for it: persona, planning, action, memory and reflection. To provide an interaction and verification environment for the agent, we build a social media simulation sandbox. In the experimental verification, automatic and human evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of the agent we constructed.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19279">Fine-Tuning Language Models with Reward Learning on Policy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Lang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences. RLHF contains three steps, i.e., human preference collecting, reward learning, and policy optimization, which are usually performed serially. Despite its popularity, however, (fixed) reward models may suffer from inaccurate off-distribution, since policy optimization continuously shifts LLMs' data distribution. Repeatedly collecting new preference data from the latest LLMs may alleviate this issue, which unfortunately makes the resulting system more complicated and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose reward learning on policy (RLP), an unsupervised framework that refines a reward model using policy samples to keep it on-distribution. Specifically, an unsupervised multi-view learning method is introduced to learn robust representations of policy samples. Meanwhile, a synthetic preference generation approach is developed to simulate high-quality preference data with policy outputs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that RLP consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Panagopoulos, Daniele Malitesta, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, Jun Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited labeled samples to reduce experimental risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Li, Shenyu Zhang, Rui Wu, Xiutian Huang, Yongrui Chen, Wenhao Xu, Guilin Qi, Dehai Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative Large Language Models(LLMs) have been remarkable, however, the quality of the text generated by these models often reveals persistent issues. Evaluating the quality of text generated by these models, especially in open-ended text, has consistently presented a significant challenge. Addressing this, recent work has explored the possibility of using LLMs as evaluators. While using a single LLM as an evaluation agent shows potential, it is filled with significant uncertainty and instability. To address these issues, we propose the MATEval: A "Multi-Agent Text Evaluation framework" where all agents are played by LLMs like GPT-4. The MATEval framework emulates human collaborative discussion methods, integrating multiple agents' interactions to evaluate open-ended text. Our framework incorporates self-reflection and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies, along with feedback mechanisms, enhancing the depth and breadth of the evaluation process and guiding discussions towards consensus, while the framework generates comprehensive evaluation reports, including error localization, error types and scoring. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms existing open-ended text evaluation methods and achieves the highest correlation with human evaluation, which confirms the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in addressing the uncertainties and instabilities in evaluating LLMs-generated text. Furthermore, our framework significantly improves the efficiency of text evaluation and model iteration in industrial scenarios.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19316">Hypergraph-based Multi-View Action Recognition using Event Cameras</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Gao, Jiaxuan Lu, Siqi Li, Yipeng Li, Shaoyi Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Action recognition from video data forms a cornerstone with wide-ranging applications. Single-view action recognition faces limitations due to its reliance on a single viewpoint. In contrast, multi-view approaches capture complementary information from various viewpoints for improved accuracy. Recently, event cameras have emerged as innovative bio-inspired sensors, leading to advancements in event-based action recognition. However, existing works predominantly focus on single-view scenarios, leaving a gap in multi-view event data exploitation, particularly in challenges like information deficit and semantic misalignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce HyperMV, a multi-view event-based action recognition framework. HyperMV converts discrete event data into frame-like representations and extracts view-related features using a shared convolutional network. By treating segments as vertices and constructing hyperedges using rule-based and KNN-based strategies, a multi-view hypergraph neural network that captures relationships across viewpoint and temporal features is established. The vertex attention hypergraph propagation is also introduced for enhanced feature fusion. To prompt research in this area, we present the largest multi-view event-based action dataset $\text{THU}^{\text{MV-EACT}}\text{-50}$, comprising 50 actions from 6 viewpoints, which surpasses existing datasets by over tenfold. Experimental results show that HyperMV significantly outperforms baselines in both cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, and also exceeds the state-of-the-arts in frame-based multi-view action recognition.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19336">IVLMap: Instance-Aware Visual Language Grounding for Consumer Robot Navigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacui Huang, Hongtao Zhang, Mingbo Zhao, Zhou Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires a robot to navigate in photo-realistic environments with human natural language promptings. Recent studies aim to handle this task by constructing the semantic spatial map representation of the environment, and then leveraging the strong ability of reasoning in large language models for generalizing code for guiding the robot navigation. However, these methods face limitations in instance-level and attribute-level navigation tasks as they cannot distinguish different instances of the same object. To address this challenge, we propose a new method, namely, Instance-aware Visual Language Map (IVLMap), to empower the robot with instance-level and attribute-level semantic mapping, where it is autonomously constructed by fusing the RGBD video data collected from the robot agent with special-designed natural language map indexing in the bird's-in-eye view. Such indexing is instance-level and attribute-level. In particular, when integrated with a large language model, IVLMap demonstrates the capability to i) transform natural language into navigation targets with instance and attribute information, enabling precise localization, and ii) accomplish zero-shot end-to-end navigation tasks based on natural language commands. Extensive navigation experiments are conducted. Simulation results illustrate that our method can achieve an average improvement of 14.4\% in navigation accuracy.

<p>Abstract: With the rapid evolution of the Internet and the exponential proliferation of information, users encounter information overload and the conundrum of choice. Personalized recommendation systems play a pivotal role in alleviating this burden by aiding users in filtering and selecting information tailored to their preferences and requirements. Such systems not only enhance user experience and satisfaction but also furnish opportunities for businesses and platforms to augment user engagement, sales, and advertising efficacy.This paper undertakes a comparative analysis between the operational mechanisms of traditional e-commerce commodity classification systems and personalized recommendation systems. It delineates the significance and application of personalized recommendation systems across e-commerce, content information, and media domains. Furthermore, it delves into the challenges confronting personalized recommendation systems in e-commerce, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, scalability, and the cold start problem. Strategies to address these challenges are elucidated.Subsequently, the paper outlines a personalized recommendation system leveraging the BERT model and nearest neighbor algorithm, specifically tailored to address the exigencies of the eBay e-commerce platform. The efficacy of this recommendation system is substantiated through manual evaluation, and a practical application operational guide and structured output recommendation results are furnished to ensure the system's operability and scalability.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19347">Breaking the Length Barrier: LLM-Enhanced CTR Prediction in Long Textual User Behaviors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Binzong Geng, Zhaoxin Huan, Xiaolu Zhang, Yong He, Liang Zhang, Fajie Yuan, Jun Zhou, Linjian Mo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), recent works have leveraged LLMs to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors. As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items. To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database. Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings. This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity. Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores. Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences. BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.</p>

Recent works showed the feasibility of this idea exploiting transient imaging data produced by custom direct Time of Flight sensors. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle this problem using only data from an off-the-shelf indirect Time of Flight sensor without any further hardware requirement. We introduced a Deep Learning model able to re-frame the surfaces where light bounces happen as a virtual mirror. This modeling makes the task easier to handle and also facilitates the construction of annotated training data.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19386">PointCloud-Text Matching: Benchmark Datasets and a Baseline</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanglin Feng, Yang Qin, Dezhong Peng, Hongyuan Zhu, Xi Peng, Peng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present and study a new instance-level retrieval task: PointCloud-Text Matching~(PTM), which aims to find the exact cross-modal instance that matches a given point-cloud query or text query. PTM could be applied to various scenarios, such as indoor/urban-canyon localization and scene retrieval. However, there exists no suitable and targeted dataset for PTM in practice. Therefore, we construct three new PTM benchmark datasets, namely 3D2T-SR, 3D2T-NR, and 3D2T-QA. We observe that the data is challenging and with noisy correspondence due to the sparsity, noise, or disorder of point clouds and the ambiguity, vagueness, or incompleteness of texts, which make existing cross-modal matching methods ineffective for PTM. To tackle these challenges, we propose a PTM baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method (RoMa). RoMa consists of two modules: a Dual Attention Perception module (DAP) and a Robust Negative Contrastive Learning module (RNCL). Specifically, DAP leverages token-level and feature-level attention to adaptively focus on useful local and global features, and aggregate them into common representations, thereby reducing the adverse impact of noise and ambiguity. To handle noisy correspondence, RNCL divides negative pairs, which are much less error-prone than positive pairs, into clean and noisy subsets, and assigns them forward and reverse optimization directions respectively, thus enhancing robustness against noisy correspondence. We conduct extensive experiments on our benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of our RoMa.</p>

<p>Abstract: Examining the effect of different encoding techniques on entity and context embeddings, the goal of this work is to challenge commonly used Ordinal encoding for tabular learning. Applying different preprocessing methods and network architectures over several datasets resulted in a benchmark on how the encoders influence the learning outcome of the networks. By keeping the test, validation and training data consistent, results have shown that ordinal encoding is not the most suited encoder for categorical data in terms of preprocessing the data and thereafter, classifying the target variable correctly. A better outcome was achieved, encoding the features based on string similarities by computing a similarity matrix as input for the network. This is the case for both, entity and context embeddings, where the transformer architecture showed improved performance for Ordinal and Similarity encoding with regard to multi-label classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been great interest in fairness in machine learning, especially in relation to classification problems. In ranking-related problems, such as in online advertising, recommender systems, and HR automation, much work on fairness remains to be done. Two complications arise: first, the protected attribute may not be available in many applications. Second, there are multiple measures of fairness of rankings, and optimization-based methods utilizing a single measure of fairness of rankings may produce rankings that are unfair with respect to other measures. In this work, we propose a randomized method for post-processing rankings, which do not require the availability of the protected attribute. In an extensive numerical study, we show the robustness of our methods with respect to P-Fairness and effectiveness with respect to Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) from the baseline ranking, improving on previously proposed methods.</p>

Typically, these features are the latent space representation from an artificial neural network, and the stimuli are image, audio, or text inputs. Ridge regression is a popular prediction model for brain encoding due to its good out-of-sample generalization performance. However, training a ridge regression model can be highly time-consuming when dealing with large-scale deep functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets that include many space-time samples of brain activity. This paper evaluates different parallelization techniques to reduce the training time of brain encoding with ridge regression on the CNeuroMod Friends dataset, one of the largest deep fMRI resource currently available. With multi-threading, our results show that the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) significantly outperforms the OpenBLAS library, being 1.9 times faster using 32 threads on a single machine. We then evaluated the Dask multi-CPU implementation of ridge regression readily available in scikit-learn (MultiOutput), and we proposed a new "batch" version of Dask parallelization, motivated by a time complexity analysis. In line with our theoretical analysis, MultiOutput parallelization was found to be impractical, i.e., slower than multi-threading on a single machine. In contrast, the Batch-MultiOutput regression scaled well across compute nodes and threads, providing speed-ups of up to 33 times with 8 compute nodes and 32 threads compared to a single-threaded scikit-learn execution. Batch parallelization using Dask thus emerges as a scalable approach for brain encoding with ridge regression on high-performance computing systems using scikit-learn and large fMRI datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Kamp, Lisa Beinborn, Antske Fokkens</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods are an important tool for increasing model transparency for users. Unfortunately, the currently used methods for attributing token importance often yield diverging patterns. In this work, we study potential sources of disagreement across methods from a linguistic perspective. We find that different methods systematically select different classes of words and that methods that agree most with other methods and with humans display similar linguistic preferences. Token-level differences between methods are smoothed out if we compare them on the syntactic span level. We also find higher agreement across methods by estimating the most important spans dynamically instead of relying on a fixed subset of size $k$. We systematically investigate the interaction between $k$ and spans and propose an improved configuration for selecting important tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Wang, Yiliang Zhou, Ziqiang Han, Cui Tao, Yunyu Xiao, Ying Ding, Joydeep Ghosh, Yifan Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Data accuracy is essential for scientific research and policy development. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data is widely used for discovering the patterns and causes of death. Recent studies suggested the annotation inconsistencies within the NVDRS and the potential impact on erroneous suicide-cause attributions. We present an empirical Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect annotation inconsistencies and adopt a cross-validation-like paradigm to identify problematic instances. We analyzed 267,804 suicide death incidents between 2003 and 2020 from the NVDRS. Our results showed that incorporating the target state's data into training the suicide-crisis classifier brought an increase of 5.4% to the F-1 score on the target state's test set and a decrease of 1.1% on other states' test set. To conclude, we demonstrated the annotation inconsistencies in NVDRS's death investigation notes, identified problematic instances, evaluated the effectiveness of correcting problematic instances, and eventually proposed an NLP improvement solution.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19459">NeuroLGP-SM: A Surrogate-assisted Neuroevolution Approach using Linear Genetic Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fergal Stapleton, Brendan Cody-Kenny, Edgar Galv\'an</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational approach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within artificial intelligence. This method extends to the training of DNNs, an approach known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is an inherently resource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of thousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network. To address the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still attaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution. Despite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into neuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the effective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in neuroevolution. In this context, we address these challenges by employing a suitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as NeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares. The amalgamation of these two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the NeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM). For comparison purposes, we also code and use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice in neuroevolution. Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16 model in accuracy. Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN operations, a singular run is typically the norm. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs. Significantly, our methodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model demonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach. Noteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25% reduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for neuroevolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongkai Gao, Zhengrong Xue, Shuying Deng, Tianhai Liang, Siqi Yang, Lin Shao, Huazhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RiEMann, an end-to-end near Real-time SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Manipulation imitation learning framework from scene point cloud input. Compared to previous methods that rely on descriptor field matching, RiEMann directly predicts the target poses of objects for manipulation without any object segmentation. RiEMann learns a manipulation task from scratch with 5 to 10 demonstrations, generalizes to unseen SE(3) transformations and instances of target objects, resists visual interference of distracting objects, and follows the near real-time pose change of the target object. The scalable action space of RiEMann facilitates the addition of custom equivariant actions such as the direction of turning the faucet, which makes articulated object manipulation possible for RiEMann. In simulation and real-world 6-DOF robot manipulation experiments, we test RiEMann on 5 categories of manipulation tasks with a total of 25 variants and show that RiEMann outperforms baselines in both task success rates and SE(3) geodesic distance errors on predicted poses (reduced by 68.6%), and achieves a 5.4 frames per second (FPS) network inference speed.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19521">Interpreting Key Mechanisms of Factual Recall in Transformer-Based Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Lv, Kaiyi Zhang, Yuhan Chen, Yulong Wang, Lifeng Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Jian Xie, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we deeply explore the mechanisms employed by Transformer-based language models in factual recall tasks. In zero-shot scenarios, given a prompt like "The capital of France is," task-specific attention heads extract the topic entity, such as "France," from the context and pass it to subsequent MLPs to recall the required answer such as "Paris." We introduce a novel analysis method aimed at decomposing the outputs of the MLP into components understandable by humans. Through this method, we quantify the function of the MLP layer following these task-specific heads. In the residual stream, it either erases or amplifies the information originating from individual heads. Moreover, it generates a component that redirects the residual stream towards the direction of its expected answer. These zero-shot mechanisms are also employed in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we observed a widely existent anti-overconfidence mechanism in the final layer of models, which suppresses correct predictions. We mitigate this suppression by leveraging our interpretation to improve factual recall performance. Our interpretations have been evaluated across various language models, from the GPT-2 families to 1.3B OPT, and across tasks covering different domains of factual knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Luo, Karine Miras, Carlo Longhi, Oliver Weissl, Agoston E. Eiben</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the integration of Lamarckian system into evolutionary robotics (ER), comparing it with the traditional Darwinian model across various environments. By adopting Lamarckian principles, where robots inherit learned traits, alongside Darwinian learning without inheritance, we investigate adaptation in dynamic settings. Our research, conducted in six distinct environmental setups, demonstrates that Lamarckian systems outperform Darwinian ones in adaptability and efficiency, particularly in challenging conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the interplay between controller \& morphological evolution and environment adaptation, with parent-offspring similarities and newborn \&survivors before and after learning providing insights into the effectiveness of trait inheritance. Our findings suggest Lamarckian principles could significantly advance autonomous system design, highlighting the potential for more adaptable and robust robotic solutions in complex, real-world applications. These theoretical insights were validated using real physical robots, bridging the gap between simulation and practical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu Luo, Xi Lin, Zhenkun Wang, Tong Xialiang, Mingxuan Yuan, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The end-to-end neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) method shows promising performance in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems without the need for expert design. However, existing methods struggle with large-scale problems, hindering their practical applicability. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel Self-Improved Learning (SIL) method for better scalability of neural combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we develop an efficient self-improved mechanism that enables direct model training on large-scale problem instances without any labeled data. Powered by an innovative local reconstruction approach, this method can iteratively generate better solutions by itself as pseudo-labels to guide efficient model training. In addition, we design a linear complexity attention mechanism for the model to efficiently handle large-scale combinatorial problem instances with low computation overhead. Comprehensive experiments on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with up to 100K nodes in both uniform and real-world distributions demonstrate the superior scalability of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongliang Zhou, Jielu Zhang, Zihan Guan, Mengxuan Hu, Ni Lao, Lan Mu, Sheng Li, Gengchen Mai</p>
<p>Abstract: Geolocating precise locations from images presents a challenging problem in computer vision and information retrieval.Traditional methods typically employ either classification, which dividing the Earth surface into grid cells and classifying images accordingly, or retrieval, which identifying locations by matching images with a database of image-location pairs. However, classification-based approaches are limited by the cell size and cannot yield precise predictions, while retrieval-based systems usually suffer from poor search quality and inadequate coverage of the global landscape at varied scale and aggregation levels. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Img2Loc, a novel system that redefines image geolocalization as a text generation task. This is achieved using cutting-edge large multi-modality models like GPT4V or LLaVA with retrieval augmented generation. Img2Loc first employs CLIP-based representations to generate an image-based coordinate query database. It then uniquely combines query results with images itself, forming elaborate prompts customized for LMMs. When tested on benchmark datasets such as Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k, Img2Loc not only surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art models but does so without any model training.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19595">Situation Awareness for Driver-Centric Driving Style Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johann Haselberger, Bonifaz Stuhr, Bernhard Schick, Steffen M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: There is evidence that the driving style of an autonomous vehicle is important to increase the acceptance and trust of the passengers. The driving situation has been found to have a significant influence on human driving behavior. However, current driving style models only partially incorporate driving environment information, limiting the alignment between an agent and the given situation. Therefore, we propose a situation-aware driving style model based on different visual feature encoders pretrained on fleet data, as well as driving behavior predictors, which are adapted to the driving style of a specific driver. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms static driving styles significantly and forms plausible situation clusters. Furthermore, we found that feature encoders pretrained on our dataset lead to more precise driving behavior modeling. In contrast, feature encoders pretrained supervised and unsupervised on different data sources lead to more specific situation clusters, which can be utilized to constrain and control the driving style adaptation for specific situations. Moreover, in a real-world setting, where driving style adaptation is happening iteratively, we found the MLP-based behavior predictors achieve good performance initially but suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, behavior predictors based on situationdependent statistics can learn iteratively from continuous data streams by design. Overall, our experiments show that important information for driving behavior prediction is contained within the visual feature encoder. The dataset is publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/jHaselberger/SADC-Situation-Awareness-for-Driver-Centric-Driving-Style-Adaptation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19603">Semantic Map-based Generation of Navigation Instructions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzu Li, Chao Zhang, Simone Teufel, Rama Sanand Doddipatla, Svetlana Stoyanchev</p>
<p>Abstract: We are interested in the generation of navigation instructions, either in their own right or as training material for robotic navigation task. In this paper, we propose a new approach to navigation instruction generation by framing the problem as an image captioning task using semantic maps as visual input. Conventional approaches employ a sequence of panorama images to generate navigation instructions. Semantic maps abstract away from visual details and fuse the information in multiple panorama images into a single top-down representation, thereby reducing computational complexity to process the input. We present a benchmark dataset for instruction generation using semantic maps, propose an initial model and ask human subjects to manually assess the quality of generated instructions. Our initial investigations show promise in using semantic maps for instruction generation instead of a sequence of panorama images, but there is vast scope for improvement. We release the code for data preparation and model training at https://github.com/chengzu-li/VLGen.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19620">Collaborative Interactive Evolution of Art in the Latent Space of Deep Generative Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ole Hall, Anil Yaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown great success in generating high quality images and are thus used as one of the main approaches to generate art images. However, usually the image generation process involves sampling from the latent space of the learned art representations, allowing little control over the output. In this work, we first employ GANs that are trained to produce creative images using an architecture known as Creative Adversarial Networks (CANs), then, we employ an evolutionary approach to navigate within the latent space of the models to discover images. We use automatic aesthetic and collaborative interactive human evaluation metrics to assess the generated images. In the human interactive evaluation case, we propose a collaborative evaluation based on the assessments of several participants. Furthermore, we also experiment with an intelligent mutation operator that aims to improve the quality of the images through local search based on an aesthetic measure. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the results produced by the automatic and collaborative interactive evolution. The results show that the proposed approach can generate highly attractive art images when the evolution is guided by collaborative human feedback.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19631">Retrieval-Enhanced Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Shi, Qiaoyu Tan, Xuansheng Wu, Shaochen Zhong, Kaixiong Zhou, Ninghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in question-answering tasks but often struggle to integrate real-time knowledge updates, leading to potentially outdated or inaccurate responses. This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with multi-hop questions since they require LLMs to update and integrate multiple knowledge pieces relevant to the questions. To tackle the problem, we propose the Retrieval-Augmented model Editing (RAE) framework tailored for multi-hop question answering. RAE first retrieves edited facts and then refines the language model through in-context learning. Specifically, our retrieval approach, based on mutual information maximization, leverages the reasoning abilities of LLMs to identify chain facts that na\"ive similarity-based searches might miss. Additionally, our framework incorporates a pruning strategy to eliminate redundant information from the retrieved facts, which enhances the editing accuracy and mitigates the hallucination problem. Our framework is supported by theoretical justification for its fact retrieval efficacy. Finally, comprehensive evaluation across various LLMs validates RAE's ability in providing accurate answers with updated knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce methods for discovering and applying sparse feature circuits. These are causally implicated subnetworks of human-interpretable features for explaining language model behaviors. Circuits identified in prior work consist of polysemantic and difficult-to-interpret units like attention heads or neurons, rendering them unsuitable for many downstream applications. In contrast, sparse feature circuits enable detailed understanding of unanticipated mechanisms. Because they are based on fine-grained units, sparse feature circuits are useful for downstream tasks: We introduce SHIFT, where we improve the generalization of a classifier by ablating features that a human judges to be task-irrelevant. Finally, we demonstrate an entirely unsupervised and scalable interpretability pipeline by discovering thousands of sparse feature circuits for automatically discovered model behaviors.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19648">Human-compatible driving partners through data-regularized self-play reinforcement learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daphne Cornelisse, Eugene Vinitsky</p>
<p>Abstract: A central challenge for autonomous vehicles is coordinating with humans. Therefore, incorporating realistic human agents is essential for scalable training and evaluation of autonomous driving systems in simulation. Simulation agents are typically developed by imitating large-scale, high-quality datasets of human driving. However, pure imitation learning agents empirically have high collision rates when executed in a multi-agent closed-loop setting. To build agents that are realistic and effective in closed-loop settings, we propose Human-Regularized PPO (HR-PPO), a multi-agent algorithm where agents are trained through self-play with a small penalty for deviating from a human reference policy. In contrast to prior work, our approach is RL-first and only uses 30 minutes of imperfect human demonstrations. We evaluate agents in a large set of multi-agent traffic scenes. Results show our HR-PPO agents are highly effective in achieving goals, with a success rate of 93%, an off-road rate of 3.5%, and a collision rate of 3%. At the same time, the agents drive in a human-like manner, as measured by their similarity to existing human driving logs. We also find that HR-PPO agents show considerable improvements on proxy measures for coordination with human driving, particularly in highly interactive scenarios. We open-source our code and trained agents at https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/nocturne_lab and provide demonstrations of agent behaviors at https://sites.google.com/view/driving-partners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zhang, Yi Luan, Hexiang Hu, Kenton Lee, Siyuan Qiao, Wenhu Chen, Yu Su, Ming-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image retrieval, i.e., finding desired images given a reference image, inherently encompasses rich, multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to capture solely using image-based measures. Recent work leverages text instructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents. However, existing work primarily focuses on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity. To show this, we introduce MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support open-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight: image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit relations (e.g., inside view of), and we can bring those implicit relations explicit by synthesizing instructions via large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs). Trained on 36.7M (query image, instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the web, MagicLens achieves comparable or better results on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Remarkably, it outperforms previous SOTA but with a 50X smaller model size on multiple benchmarks. Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sirui Xu, Ziyin Wang, Yu-Xiong Wang, Liang-Yan Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-conditioned human motion generation has experienced significant advancements with diffusion models trained on extensive motion capture data and corresponding textual annotations. However, extending such success to 3D dynamic human-object interaction (HOI) generation faces notable challenges, primarily due to the lack of large-scale interaction data and comprehensive descriptions that align with these interactions. This paper takes the initiative and showcases the potential of generating human-object interactions without direct training on text-interaction pair data. Our key insight in achieving this is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled. Being unable to learn interaction semantics through supervised training, we instead leverage pre-trained large models, synergizing knowledge from a large language model and a text-to-motion model. While such knowledge offers high-level control over interaction semantics, it cannot grasp the intricacies of low-level interaction dynamics. To overcome this issue, we further introduce a world model designed to comprehend simple physics, modeling how human actions influence object motion. By integrating these components, our novel framework, InterDreamer, is able to generate text-aligned 3D HOI sequences in a zero-shot manner. We apply InterDreamer to the BEHAVE and CHAIRS datasets, and our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates its capability to generate realistic and coherent interaction sequences that seamlessly align with the text directives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Alvarez Colmenares</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is focusing on creating automated decision-making (ADM) systems that operate as close as possible to human-like intelligence. This effort has pushed AI researchers into exploring cognitive fields like psychology. The work of Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky on biased human decision-making, including the study of the conjunction fallacy, has experienced a second revival because of this. Under the conjunction fallacy a human decision-maker will go against basic probability laws and rank as more likely a conjunction over one of its parts. It has been proven overtime through a set of experiments with the Linda Problem being the most famous one. Although this interdisciplinary effort is welcomed, we fear that AI researchers ignore the driving force behind the conjunction fallacy as captured by the Linda Problem: the fact that Linda must be stereotypically described as a woman. In this paper we revisit the Linda Problem and formulate it as a fairness problem. In doing so we introduce perception as a parameter of interest through the structural causal perception framework. Using an illustrative decision-making example, we showcase the proposed conceptual framework and its potential impact for developing fair ADM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Hubert, Heiko Paulheim, Armelle Brun, Davy Monticolo</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) developed for link prediction learn vector representations for entities in a knowledge graph, known as embeddings. A common tacit assumption is the KGE entity similarity assumption, which states that these KGEMs retain the graph's structure within their embedding space, \textit{i.e.}, position similar entities within the graph close to one another. This desirable property make KGEMs widely used in downstream tasks such as recommender systems or drug repurposing. Yet, the relation of entity similarity and similarity in the embedding space has rarely been formally evaluated. Typically, KGEMs are assessed based on their sole link prediction capabilities, using ranked-based metrics such as Hits@K or Mean Rank. This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that entity similarity in the graph is inherently mirrored in the embedding space. Therefore, we conduct extensive experiments to measure the capability of KGEMs to cluster similar entities together, and investigate the nature of the underlying factors. Moreover, we study if different KGEMs expose a different notion of similarity. Datasets, pre-trained embeddings and code are available at: https://github.com/nicolas-hbt/similar-embeddings/.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01786">COA-GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformers for Accelerated Course of Action Development in Military Operations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinicius G. Goecks, Nicholas Waytowich</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Courses of Action (COAs) in military operations is traditionally a time-consuming and intricate process. Addressing this challenge, this study introduces COA-GPT, a novel algorithm employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid and efficient generation of valid COAs. COA-GPT incorporates military doctrine and domain expertise to LLMs through in-context learning, allowing commanders to input mission information - in both text and image formats - and receive strategically aligned COAs for review and approval. Uniquely, COA-GPT not only accelerates COA development, producing initial COAs within seconds, but also facilitates real-time refinement based on commander feedback. This work evaluates COA-GPT in a military-relevant scenario within a militarized version of the StarCraft II game, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results demonstrate COA-GPT's superiority in generating strategically sound COAs more swiftly, with added benefits of enhanced adaptability and alignment with commander intentions. COA-GPT's capability to rapidly adapt and update COAs during missions presents a transformative potential for military planning, particularly in addressing planning discrepancies and capitalizing on emergent windows of opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seil Kang, Donghyun Kim, Junhyeok Kim, Hyo Kyung Lee, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant methodological strides have been made toward Chest X-ray (CXR) understanding via modern vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating impressive Visual Question Answering (VQA) and CXR report generation abilities. However, existing CXR understanding frameworks still possess several procedural caveats. (1) Previous methods solely use CXR reports, which are insufficient for comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially when additional health-related data like medication history and prior diagnoses are needed. (2) Previous methods use raw CXR reports, which are often arbitrarily structured. While modern language models can understand various text formats, restructuring reports for clearer, organized anatomy-based information could enhance their usefulness. (3) Current evaluation methods for CXR-VQA primarily emphasize linguistic correctness, lacking the capability to offer nuanced assessments of the generated answers. In this work, to address the aforementioned caveats, we introduce WoLF, a Wide-scope Large Language Model Framework for CXR understanding. To resolve (1), we capture multi-faceted records of patients, which are utilized for accurate diagnoses in real-world clinical scenarios. Specifically, we adopt the Electronic Health Records (EHR) to generate instruction-following data suited for CXR understanding. Regarding (2), we enhance report generation performance by decoupling knowledge in CXR reports based on anatomical structure even within the attention step via masked attention. To address (3), we introduce an AI-evaluation protocol optimized for assessing the capabilities of LLM. Through extensive experimental validations, WoLF demonstrates superior performance over other models on MIMIC-CXR in the AI-evaluation arena about VQA (up to +9.47%p mean score) and by metrics about report generation (+7.3%p BLEU-1).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyu Chen, Guoqiang Li, Ling-I Wu, Ruibang Liu, Yuxin Su, Xi Chang, Jianxin Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing logic problems. capitalizing on the great capabilities of LLMs for code-related activities, several frameworks leveraging logical solvers for logic reasoning have been proposed recently. While existing research predominantly focuses on viewing LLMs as natural language logic solvers or translators, their roles as logic code interpreters and executors have received limited attention. This study delves into a novel aspect, namely logic code simulation, which forces LLMs to emulate logical solvers in predicting the results of logical programs. To further investigate this novel task, we formulate our three research questions: Can LLMs efficiently simulate the outputs of logic codes? What strength arises along with logic code simulation? And what pitfalls? To address these inquiries, we curate three novel datasets tailored for the logic code simulation task and undertake thorough experiments to establish the baseline performance of LLMs in code simulation. Subsequently, we introduce a pioneering LLM-based code simulation technique, Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL). This technique advocates a dual-path thinking approach for LLMs, which has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance compared to other LLM prompt strategies, achieving a notable improvement in accuracy by 7.06% with GPT-4-Turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Samavati, Mahdi Farvardin, Aboozar Ghaffari</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing use of smartphones in our daily lives, these devices have become capable of performing many complex tasks. Concerning the need for continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially for the elderly or those with certain types of diseases, the development of algorithms that can estimate vital signs using smartphones has attracted researchers worldwide. In particular, researchers have been exploring ways to estimate vital signs, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation levels, and respiratory rate, using algorithms that can be run on smartphones. However, many of these algorithms require multiple pre-processing steps that might introduce some implementation overheads or require the design of a couple of hand-crafted stages to obtain an optimal result. To address this issue, this research proposes a novel end-to-end solution to mobile-based vital sign estimation using deep learning that eliminates the need for pre-processing. By using a fully convolutional architecture, the proposed model has much fewer parameters and less computational complexity compared to the architectures that use fully-connected layers as the prediction heads. This also reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, a public dataset for vital sign estimation, which includes 62 videos collected from 35 men and 27 women, is provided. Overall, the proposed end-to-end approach promises significantly improved efficiency and performance for on-device health monitoring on readily available consumer electronics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tharindu Ranasinghe, Isuri Anuradha, Damith Premasiri, Kanishka Silva, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Lasitha Uyangodage, Marcos Zampieri</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread of offensive content online, such as hate speech and cyber-bullying, is a global phenomenon. This has sparked interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) communities, motivating the development of various systems trained to detect potentially harmful content automatically. These systems require annotated datasets to train the machine learning (ML) models. However, with a few notable exceptions, most datasets on this topic have dealt with English and a few other high-resource languages. As a result, the research in offensive language identification has been limited to these languages. This paper addresses this gap by tackling offensive language identification in Sinhala, a low-resource Indo-Aryan language spoken by over 17 million people in Sri Lanka. We introduce the Sinhala Offensive Language Dataset (SOLD) and present multiple experiments on this dataset. SOLD is a manually annotated dataset containing 10,000 posts from Twitter annotated as offensive and not offensive at both sentence-level and token-level, improving the explainability of the ML models. SOLD is the first large publicly available offensive language dataset compiled for Sinhala. We also introduce SemiSOLD, a larger dataset containing more than 145,000 Sinhala tweets, annotated following a semi-supervised approach.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08635">Self-Prompting Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Open-Domain QA</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlong Li, Jinyuan Wang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) aims to answer questions without explicitly providing specific background documents. This task becomes notably challenging in a zero-shot setting where no data is available to train tailored retrieval-reader models. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have demonstrated their effectiveness in zero-shot ODQA using direct prompting methods, these methods still fall short of fully harnessing the potential of LLMs when implicitly invoked. In this paper, we propose a Self-Prompting framework to explicitly utilize the massive knowledge encoded in the parameters of LLMs and their strong instruction understanding abilities. Concretely, we prompt LLMs step by step to generate multiple pseudo QA pairs with background passages and explanations entirely from scratch. These generated elements are then utilized for in-context learning. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods on three widely-used ODQA datasets and even achieves comparable performance with various customized fine-tuned models on full training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Queeney, Erhan Can Ozcan, Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis, Christos G. Cassandras</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness and safety are critical for the trustworthy deployment of deep reinforcement learning. Real-world decision making applications require algorithms that can guarantee robust performance and safety in the presence of general environment disturbances, while making limited assumptions on the data collection process during training. In order to accomplish this goal, we introduce a safe reinforcement learning framework that incorporates robustness through the use of an optimal transport cost uncertainty set. We provide an efficient implementation based on applying Optimal Transport Perturbations to construct worst-case virtual state transitions, which does not impact data collection during training and does not require detailed simulator access. In experiments on continuous control tasks with safety constraints, our approach demonstrates robust performance while significantly improving safety at deployment time compared to standard safe reinforcement learning.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03788">Toward a Theory of Causation for Interpreting Neural Code Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> David N. Palacio, Alejandro Velasco, Nathan Cooper, Alvaro Rodriguez, Kevin Moran, Denys Poshyvanyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Language Models of Code, or Neural Code Models (NCMs), are rapidly progressing from research prototypes to commercial developer tools. As such, understanding the capabilities and limitations of such models is becoming critical. However, the abilities of these models are typically measured using automated metrics that often only reveal a portion of their real-world performance. While, in general, the performance of NCMs appears promising, currently much is unknown about how such models arrive at decisions. To this end, this paper introduces $do_{code}$, a post hoc interpretability method specific to NCMs that is capable of explaining model predictions. $do_{code}$ is based upon causal inference to enable programming language-oriented explanations. While the theoretical underpinnings of $do_{code}$ are extensible to exploring different model properties, we provide a concrete instantiation that aims to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations by grounding explanations of model behavior in properties of programming languages. To demonstrate the practical benefit of $do_{code}$, we illustrate the insights that our framework can provide by performing a case study on two popular deep learning architectures and ten NCMs. The results of this case study illustrate that our studied NCMs are sensitive to changes in code syntax. All our NCMs, except for the BERT-like model, statistically learn to predict tokens related to blocks of code (\eg brackets, parenthesis, semicolon) with less confounding bias as compared to other programming language constructs. These insights demonstrate the potential of $do_{code}$ as a useful method to detect and facilitate the elimination of confounding bias in NCMs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12627">Targeted collapse regularized autoencoder for anomaly detection: black hole at the center</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Ghafourian, Huanyi Shui, Devesh Upadhyay, Rajesh Gupta, Dimitar Filev, Iman Soltani Bozchalooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoencoders have been extensively used in the development of recent anomaly detection techniques. The premise of their application is based on the notion that after training the autoencoder on normal training data, anomalous inputs will exhibit a significant reconstruction error. Consequently, this enables a clear differentiation between normal and anomalous samples. In practice, however, it is observed that autoencoders can generalize beyond the normal class and achieve a small reconstruction error on some of the anomalous samples. To improve the performance, various techniques propose additional components and more sophisticated training procedures. In this work, we propose a remarkably straightforward alternative: instead of adding neural network components, involved computations, and cumbersome training, we complement the reconstruction loss with a computationally light term that regulates the norm of representations in the latent space. The simplicity of our approach minimizes the requirement for hyperparameter tuning and customization for new applications which, paired with its permissive data modality constraint, enhances the potential for successful adoption across a broad range of applications. We test the method on various visual and tabular benchmarks and demonstrate that the technique matches and frequently outperforms more complex alternatives. We further demonstrate that implementing this idea in the context of state-of-the-art methods can further improve their performance. We also provide a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that help demonstrate the underlying process that unfolds during training and how it helps with anomaly detection. This mitigates the black-box nature of autoencoder-based anomaly detection algorithms and offers an avenue for further investigation of advantages, fail cases, and potential new directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spandan Garg, Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam, Neel Sundaresan</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance bugs are non-functional bugs that can even manifest in well-tested commercial products. Fixing these performance bugs is an important yet challenging problem. In this work, we address this challenge and present a new approach called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Generation (RAPGen). Given a code snippet with a performance issue, RAPGen first retrieves a prompt instruction from a pre-constructed knowledge-base of previous performance bug fixes and then generates a prompt using the retrieved instruction. It then uses this prompt on a Large Language Model (such as Codex) in zero-shot to generate a fix. We compare our approach with the various prompt variations and state of the art methods in the task of performance bug fixing. Our evaluation shows that RAPGen can generate performance improvement suggestions equivalent or better than a developer in ~60% of the cases, getting ~42% of them verbatim, in an expert-verified dataset of past performance changes made by C# developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Norbert Tihanyi, Tamas Bisztray, Ridhi Jain, Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Lucas C. Cordeiro, Vasileios Mavroeidis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the FormAI dataset, a large collection of 112, 000 AI-generated compilable and independent C programs with vulnerability classification. We introduce a dynamic zero-shot prompting technique constructed to spawn diverse programs utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset is generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and comprises programs with varying levels of complexity. Some programs handle complicated tasks like network management, table games, or encryption, while others deal with simpler tasks like string manipulation. Every program is labeled with the vulnerabilities found within the source code, indicating the type, line number, and vulnerable function name. This is accomplished by employing a formal verification method using the Efficient SMT-based Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC), which uses model checking, abstract interpretation, constraint programming, and satisfiability modulo theories to reason over safety/security properties in programs. This approach definitively detects vulnerabilities and offers a formal model known as a counterexample, thus eliminating the possibility of generating false positive reports. We have associated the identified vulnerabilities with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers. We make the source code available for the 112, 000 programs, accompanied by a separate file containing the vulnerabilities detected in each program, making the dataset ideal for training LLMs and machine learning algorithms. Our study unveiled that according to ESBMC, 51.24% of the programs generated by GPT-3.5 contained vulnerabilities, thereby presenting considerable risks to software safety and security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrit Diggavi Seshadri, Alessandra Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, following the intuition that adverbs describing scene-sequences are best identified by reasoning over high-level concepts of object-behavior, we propose the design of a new framework that reasons over object-behaviours extracted from raw-video-clips to recognize the clip's corresponding adverb-types. Importantly, while previous works for general scene adverb-recognition assume knowledge of the clips underlying action-types, our method is directly applicable in the more general problem setting where the action-type of a video-clip is unknown. Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline that extracts human-interpretable object-behaviour-facts from raw video clips and propose novel symbolic and transformer based reasoning methods that operate over these extracted facts to identify adverb-types. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed methods perform favourably against the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, to support efforts in symbolic video-processing, we release two new datasets of object-behaviour-facts extracted from raw video clips - the MSR-VTT-ASP and ActivityNet-ASP datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyal Weiss, Ariel Felner, Gal A. Kaminka</p>
<p>Abstract: The shortest path problem in graphs is fundamental to AI. Nearly all variants of the problem and relevant algorithms that solve them ignore edge-weight computation time and its common relation to weight uncertainty. This implies that taking these factors into consideration can potentially lead to a performance boost in relevant applications. Recently, a generalized framework for weighted directed graphs was suggested, where edge-weight can be computed (estimated) multiple times, at increasing accuracy and run-time expense. We build on this framework to introduce the problem of finding the tightest admissible shortest path (TASP); a path with the tightest suboptimality bound on the optimal cost. This is a generalization of the shortest path problem to bounded uncertainty, where edge-weight uncertainty can be traded for computational cost. We present a complete algorithm for solving TASP, with guarantees on solution quality. Empirical evaluation supports the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ermis Soumalias, Jakob Weissteiner, Jakob Heiss, Sven Seuken</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the design of iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, several papers have recently proposed machine learning (ML)-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most important information from bidders. However, from a practical point of view, the main shortcoming of this prior work is that those designs elicit bidders' preferences via value queries (i.e., ``What is your value for the bundle $\{A,B\}$?''). In most real-world ICA domains, value queries are considered impractical, since they impose an unrealistically high cognitive burden on bidders, which is why they are not used in practice. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by designing an ML-powered combinatorial clock auction that elicits information from the bidders only via demand queries (i.e., ``At prices $p$, what is your most preferred bundle of items?''). We make two key technical contributions: First, we present a novel method for training an ML model on demand queries. Second, based on those trained ML models, we introduce an efficient method for determining the demand query with the highest clearing potential, for which we also provide a theoretical foundation. We experimentally evaluate our ML-based demand query mechanism in several spectrum auction domains and compare it against the most established real-world ICA: the combinatorial clock auction (CCA). Our mechanism significantly outperforms the CCA in terms of efficiency in all domains, it achieves higher efficiency in a significantly reduced number of rounds, and, using linear prices, it exhibits vastly higher clearing potential. Thus, with this paper we bridge the gap between research and practice and propose the first practical ML-powered ICA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Communicating shapes our social word. For a robot to be considered social and being consequently integrated in our social environment it is fundamental to understand some of the dynamics that rule human-human communication. In this work, we tackle the problem of Addressee Estimation, the ability to understand an utterance's addressee, by interpreting and exploiting non-verbal bodily cues from the speaker. We do so by implementing an hybrid deep learning model composed of convolutional layers and LSTM cells taking as input images portraying the face of the speaker and 2D vectors of the speaker's body posture. Our implementation choices were guided by the aim to develop a model that could be deployed on social robots and be efficient in ecological scenarios. We demonstrate that our model is able to solve the Addressee Estimation problem in terms of addressee localisation in space, from a robot ego-centric point of view.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Dong, Xingyi Zhang, Sibo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection has gained significant attention as it finds applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the spectral properties of graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and unsatisfying performance. In this paper, we re-investigate the spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main observation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy between these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral energy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient, indicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous properties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Network (RQGNN), the first spectral GNN that explores the inherent spectral features of anomalous graphs for graph-level anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework with two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and Chebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the Rayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space of graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN outperforms the best rival by 6.74% in Macro-F1 score and 1.44% in AUC, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Wang, Victoria Huang, Gang Chen, Hui Ma, Bryce Chen, Jochen Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimal placement of sensors for environmental monitoring and disaster management is a challenging problem due to its NP-hard nature. Traditional methods for sensor placement involve exact, approximation, or heuristic approaches, with the latter being the most widely used. However, heuristic methods are limited by expert intuition and experience. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising approach for generating heuristic algorithms automatically. In this paper, we introduce a novel sensor placement approach focused on learning improvement heuristics using deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Our approach leverages an RL formulation for learning improvement heuristics, driven by an actor-critic algorithm for training the policy network. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art approaches by conducting comprehensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach in producing high-quality solutions. Our work presents a promising direction for applying advanced DL and RL techniques to challenging climate sensor placement problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyue Jia, Yiding Liu, Xiangyu Zhao, Xiaopeng Li, Changying Hao, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Query expansion, pivotal in search engines, enhances the representation of user information needs with additional terms. While existing methods expand queries using retrieved or generated contextual documents, each approach has notable limitations. Retrieval-based methods often fail to accurately capture search intent, particularly with brief or ambiguous queries. Generation-based methods, utilizing large language models (LLMs), generally lack corpus-specific knowledge and entail high fine-tuning costs. To address these gaps, we propose a novel zero-shot query expansion framework utilizing LLMs for mutual verification. Specifically, we first design a query-query-document generation method, leveraging LLMs' zero-shot reasoning ability to produce diverse sub-queries and corresponding documents. Then, a mutual verification process synergizes generated and retrieved documents for optimal expansion. Our proposed method is fully zero-shot, and extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness over existing methods. Our code is available online at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MILL to ease reproduction.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19654">MCAD: Multi-teacher Cross-modal Alignment Distillation for efficient image-text retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Youbo Lei, Feifei He, Chen Chen, Yingbin Mo, Si Jia Li, Defeng Xie, Haonan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the success of large-scale visual-language pretraining (VLP) models and the widespread use of image-text retrieval in industry areas, it is now critically necessary to reduce the model size and streamline their mobile-device deployment. Single- and dual-stream model structures are commonly used in image-text retrieval with the goal of closing the semantic gap between textual and visual modalities. While single-stream models use deep feature fusion to achieve more accurate cross-model alignment, dual-stream models are better at offline indexing and fast inference.We propose a Multi-teacher Cross-modality Alignment Distillation (MCAD) technique to integrate the advantages of single- and dual-stream models. By incorporating the fused single-stream features into the image and text features of the dual-stream model, we formulate new modified teacher similarity distributions and features. Then, we conduct both distribution and feature distillation to boost the capability of the student dual-stream model, achieving high retrieval performance without increasing inference complexity.Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance and high efficiency of MCAD on image-text retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we implement a lightweight CLIP model on Snapdragon/Dimensity chips with only $\sim$100M running memory and $\sim$8.0ms search latency, achieving the mobile-device application of VLP models.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06958">Towards probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Conditioned Spatio-Temporal Normalizing Flows</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christina Winkler</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative normalizing flows are able to model multimodal spatial distributions, and they have been shown to model temporal correlations successfully as well. These models provide several benefits over other types of generative models due to their training stability, invertibility and efficiency in sampling and inference. This makes them a suitable candidate for stochastic spatio-temporal prediction problems, which are omnipresent in many fields of sciences, such as earth sciences, astrophysics or molecular sciences. In this paper, we present conditional normalizing flows for stochastic spatio-temporal modelling. The method is evaluated on the task of daily temperature and hourly geopotential map prediction from ERA5 datasets. Experiments show that our method is able to capture spatio-temporal correlations and extrapolates well beyond the time horizon used during training.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09682">MacGyver: Are Large Language Models Creative Problem Solvers?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Tian, Abhilasha Ravichander, Lianhui Qin, Ronan Le Bras, Raja Marjieh, Nanyun Peng, Yejin Choi, Thomas L. Griffiths, Faeze Brahman</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the creative problem-solving capabilities of modern LLMs in a novel constrained setting. To this end, we create MACGYVER, an automatically generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box thinking. We then present our collection to both LLMs and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. MACGYVER is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, LLMs, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking.
  This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both humans and AI.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522">Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Jianwei Zheng, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence (e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and generated images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and semantic coherence separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly integrate local contextual physical coherence into each pixel's generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in both image generation quality and controllability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning is a subfield of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: "Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?". We set the stage by examining recent continual learning papers published at four major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they might seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model editing, personalization and specialization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful. This work is the result of the many discussions the authors had at the Dagstuhl seminar on Deep Continual Learning, in March 2023.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutao Feng, Yintong Shang, Xuan Li, Tianjia Shao, Chenfanfu Jiang, Yin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that physics-based simulations can be seamlessly integrated with NeRF to generate high-quality elastodynamics of real-world objects. Unlike existing methods, we discretize nonlinear hyperelasticity in a meshless way, obviating the necessity for intermediate auxiliary shape proxies like a tetrahedral mesh or voxel grid. A quadratic generalized moving least square (Q-GMLS) is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation. As a result, physically realistic animations can be conveniently synthesized using our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials at an interactive rate.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13628">Prompt Risk Control: A Rigorous Framework for Responsible Deployment of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas P. Zollo, Todd Morrill, Zhun Deng, Jake C. Snell, Toniann Pitassi, Richard Zemel</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent explosion in the capabilities of large language models has led to a wave of interest in how best to prompt a model to perform a given task. While it may be tempting to simply choose a prompt based on average performance on a validation set, this can lead to a deployment where unexpectedly poor responses are generated, especially for the worst-off users. To mitigate this prospect, we propose Prompt Risk Control, a lightweight framework for selecting a prompt based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We offer methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of metrics, including quantities that measure worst-case responses and disparities in generation quality across the population of users. In addition, we extend the underlying statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution shifts in deployment. Experiments on applications such as open-ended chat, medical question summarization, and code generation highlight how such a framework can foster responsible deployment by reducing the risk of the worst outcomes.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18331">MRFP: Learning Generalizable Semantic Segmentation from Sim-2-Real with Multi-Resolution Feature Perturbation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumanth Udupa, Prajwal Gurunath, Aniruddh Sikdar, Suresh Sundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown exemplary performance on semantic scene understanding tasks on source domains, but due to the absence of style diversity during training, enhancing performance on unseen target domains using only single source domain data remains a challenging task. Generation of simulated data is a feasible alternative to retrieving large style-diverse real-world datasets as it is a cumbersome and budget-intensive process. However, the large domain-specfic inconsistencies between simulated and real-world data pose a significant generalization challenge in semantic segmentation. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel MultiResolution Feature Perturbation (MRFP) technique to randomize domain-specific fine-grained features and perturb style of coarse features. Our experimental results on various urban-scene segmentation datasets clearly indicate that, along with the perturbation of style-information, perturbation of fine-feature components is paramount to learn domain invariant robust feature maps for semantic segmentation models. MRFP is a simple and computationally efficient, transferable module with no additional learnable parameters or objective functions, that helps state-of-the-art deep neural networks to learn robust domain invariant features for simulation-to-real semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhuai Ren, Linli Yao, Shicheng Li, Xu Sun, Lu Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes TimeChat, a time-sensitive multimodal large language model specifically designed for long video understanding. Our model incorporates two key architectural contributions: (1) a timestamp-aware frame encoder that binds visual content with the timestamp of each frame, and (2) a sliding video Q-Former that produces a video token sequence of varying lengths to accommodate videos of various durations. Additionally, we construct an instruction-tuning dataset, encompassing 6 tasks and a total of 125K instances, to further enhance TimeChat's instruction-following performance. Experiment results across various video understanding tasks, such as dense captioning, temporal grounding, and highlight detection, demonstrate TimeChat's strong zero-shot temporal localization and reasoning capabilities. For example, it achieves +9.2 F1 score and +2.8 CIDEr on YouCook2, +5.8 HIT@1 on QVHighlights, and +27.5 R@1 (IoU=0.5) on Charades-STA, compared to state-of-the-art video large language models, holding the potential to serve as a versatile video assistant for long-form video comprehension tasks and satisfy realistic user requirements.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03596">MMM: Generative Masked Motion Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekkasit Pinyoanuntapong, Pu Wang, Minwoo Lee, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using diffusion and autoregressive models have shown promising results. However, these models often suffer from a trade-off between real-time performance, high fidelity, and motion editability. To address this gap, we introduce MMM, a novel yet simple motion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two key components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a sequence of discrete tokens in latent space, and (2) a conditional masked motion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens, conditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text tokens in all directions, MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among motion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During inference, this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion tokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions, therefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion generation. In addition, MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing mask tokens in the place that needs editing, MMM automatically fills the gaps while guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts. Extensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM surpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced by superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429), while offering advanced editing features such as body-part modification, motion in-betweening, and the synthesis of long motion sequences. In addition, MMM is two orders of magnitude faster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models. Our project page is available at \url{https://exitudio.github.io/MMM-page}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Zhang, Yi-Fan Zhang, Yaodong Yu, Dhruv Madeka, Dean Foster, Eric Xing, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Sham Kakade</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for the safe deployment of machine learning models, and prior research has demonstrated improvements in the calibration of modern language models (LMs). We study in-context learning (ICL), a prevalent method for adapting static LMs through tailored prompts, and examine the balance between performance and calibration across a broad spectrum of natural language understanding and reasoning tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe that, with an increasing number of ICL examples, models initially exhibit increased miscalibration before achieving better calibration and miscalibration tends to arise in low-shot settings. Moreover, we find that methods aimed at improving usability, such as fine-tuning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, can lead to miscalibration and unreliable natural language explanations. Furthermore, we explore recalibration techniques and find that a scaling-binning calibrator can reduce calibration errors consistently.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a technique to deterministically learn features with discrete codebook representations. It is commonly performed with a variational autoencoding model, VQ-VAE, which can be further extended to hierarchical structures for making high-fidelity reconstructions. However, such hierarchical extensions of VQ-VAE often suffer from the codebook/layer collapse issue, where the codebook is not efficiently used to express the data, and hence degrades reconstruction accuracy. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel unified framework to stochastically learn hierarchical discrete representation on the basis of the variational Bayes framework, called hierarchically quantized variational autoencoder (HQ-VAE). HQ-VAE naturally generalizes the hierarchical variants of VQ-VAE, such as VQ-VAE-2 and residual-quantized VAE (RQ-VAE), and provides them with a Bayesian training scheme. Our comprehensive experiments on image datasets show that HQ-VAE enhances codebook usage and improves reconstruction performance. We also validated HQ-VAE in terms of its applicability to a different modality with an audio dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication. However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruna Junqueira, Bruno Aristimunha, Sylvain Chevallier, Raphael Y. de Camargo</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have shown promising results, they are hindered by the substantial data requirements. By leveraging data from multiple subjects, transfer learning enables more effective training of DL models. A technique that is gaining popularity is Euclidean Alignment (EA) due to its ease of use, low computational complexity, and compatibility with Deep Learning models. However, few studies evaluate its impact on the training performance of shared and individual DL models. In this work, we systematically evaluate the effect of EA combined with DL for decoding BCI signals. We used EA to train shared models with data from multiple subjects and evaluated its transferability to new subjects. Our experimental results show that it improves decoding in the target subject by 4.33% and decreases convergence time by more than 70%. We also trained individual models for each subject to use as a majority-voting ensemble classifier. In this scenario, using EA improved the 3-model ensemble accuracy by 3.7%. However, when compared to the shared model with EA, the ensemble accuracy was 3.62% lower.</p>

<p>Abstract: Future warfare will require Command and Control (C2) personnel to make decisions at shrinking timescales in complex and potentially ill-defined situations. Given the need for robust decision-making processes and decision-support tools, integration of artificial and human intelligence holds the potential to revolutionize the C2 operations process to ensure adaptability and efficiency in rapidly changing operational environments. We propose to leverage recent promising breakthroughs in interactive machine learning, in which humans can cooperate with machine learning algorithms to guide machine learning algorithm behavior. This paper identifies several gaps in state-of-the-art science and technology that future work should address to extend these approaches to function in complex C2 contexts. In particular, we describe three research focus areas that together, aim to enable scalable interactive machine learning (SIML): 1) developing human-AI interaction algorithms to enable planning in complex, dynamic situations; 2) fostering resilient human-AI teams through optimizing roles, configurations, and trust; and 3) scaling algorithms and human-AI teams for flexibility across a range of potential contexts and situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaleb McDowell, Ellen Novoseller, Anna Madison, Vinicius G. Goecks, Christopher Kelshaw</p>
<p>Abstract: Future warfare will require Command and Control (C2) decision-making to occur in more complex, fast-paced, ill-structured, and demanding conditions. C2 will be further complicated by operational challenges such as Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) communications and the need to account for many data streams, potentially across multiple domains of operation. Yet, current C2 practices -- which stem from the industrial era rather than the emerging intelligence era -- are linear and time-consuming. Critically, these approaches may fail to maintain overmatch against adversaries on the future battlefield. To address these challenges, we propose a vision for future C2 based on robust partnerships between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This future vision is encapsulated in three operational impacts: streamlining the C2 operations process, maintaining unity of effort, and developing adaptive collective knowledge systems. This paper illustrates the envisaged future C2 capabilities, discusses the assumptions that shaped them, and describes how the proposed developments could transform C2 in future warfare.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08714">PRDP: Proximal Reward Difference Prediction for Large-Scale Reward Finetuning of Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Deng, Qifei Wang, Wei Wei, Matthias Grundmann, Tingbo Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward finetuning has emerged as a promising approach to aligning foundation models with downstream objectives. Remarkable success has been achieved in the language domain by using reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize rewards that reflect human preference. However, in the vision domain, existing RL-based reward finetuning methods are limited by their instability in large-scale training, rendering them incapable of generalizing to complex, unseen prompts. In this paper, we propose Proximal Reward Difference Prediction (PRDP), enabling stable black-box reward finetuning for diffusion models for the first time on large-scale prompt datasets with over 100K prompts. Our key innovation is the Reward Difference Prediction (RDP) objective that has the same optimal solution as the RL objective while enjoying better training stability. Specifically, the RDP objective is a supervised regression objective that tasks the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments, we demonstrate that PRDP can match the reward maximization ability of well-established RL-based methods in small-scale training. Furthermore, through large-scale training on text prompts from the Human Preference Dataset v2 and the Pick-a-Pic v1 dataset, PRDP achieves superior generation quality on a diverse set of complex, unseen prompts whereas RL-based methods completely fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhang Yuan, Daoze Zhang, Junru Chen, Gefei Gu, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational models benefit from pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data and enable strong performance in a wide variety of applications with a small amount of labeled data. Such models can be particularly effective in analyzing brain signals, as this field encompasses numerous application scenarios, and it is costly to perform large-scale annotation. In this work, we present the largest foundation model in brain signals, Brant-2. Compared to Brant, a foundation model designed for intracranial neural signals, Brant-2 not only exhibits robustness towards data variations and modeling scales but also can be applied to a broader range of brain neural data. By experimenting on an extensive range of tasks, we demonstrate that Brant-2 is adaptive to various application scenarios in brain signals. Further analyses reveal the scalability of the Brant-2, validate each component's effectiveness, and showcase our model's ability to maintain performance in scenarios with scarce labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanran Chen, Wei Zhao, Anne Breitbarth, Manuel Stoeckel, Alexander Mehler, Steffen Eger</p>
<p>Abstract: Many studies have shown that human languages tend to optimize for lower complexity and increased communication efficiency. Syntactic dependency distance, which measures the linear distance between dependent words, is often considered a key indicator of language processing difficulty and working memory load. The current paper looks at diachronic trends in syntactic language change in both English and German, using corpora of parliamentary debates from the last c. 160 years. We base our observations on five dependency parsers, including the widely used Stanford CoreNLP as well as 4 newer alternatives. Our analysis of syntactic language change goes beyond linear dependency distance and explores 15 metrics relevant to dependency distance minimization (DDM) and/or based on tree graph properties, such as the tree height and degree variance. Even though we have evidence that recent parsers trained on modern treebanks are not heavily affected by data 'noise' such as spelling changes and OCR errors in our historic data, we find that results of syntactic language change are sensitive to the parsers involved, which is a caution against using a single parser for evaluating syntactic language change as done in previous work. We also show that syntactic language change over the time period investigated is largely similar between English and German for the different metrics explored: only 4% of cases we examine yield opposite conclusions regarding upwards and downtrends of syntactic metrics across German and English. We also show that changes in syntactic measures seem to be more frequent at the tails of sentence length distributions. To our best knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of syntactic language change using modern NLP technology in recent corpora of English and German.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11815">HU at SemEval-2024 Task 8A: Can Contrastive Learning Learn Embeddings to Detect Machine-Generated Text?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubhashis Roy Dipta, Sadat Shahriar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes our system developed for SemEval-2024 Task 8, ``Multigenerator, Multidomain, and Multilingual Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection'' Machine-generated texts have been one of the main concerns due to the use of large language models (LLM) in fake text generation, phishing, cheating in exams, or even plagiarizing copyright materials. A lot of systems have been developed to detect machine-generated text. Nonetheless, the majority of these systems rely on the text-generating model. This limitation is impractical in real-world scenarios, as it's often impossible to know which specific model the user has used for text generation. In this work, we propose a $\textbf{single}$ model based on contrastive learning, which uses $\textbf{$\approx$40% of the baseline's parameters}$ (149M vs. 355M) but shows a comparable performance on the test dataset $(\textbf{21st out of 137 participants})$. Our key finding is that even without an ensemble of multiple models, a single base model can have comparable performance with the help of data augmentation and contrastive learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mojtaba Valizadeh, Nathana\"el Fijalkow, Martin Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is widely used in industrial verification. LTL formulae can be learned from traces. Scaling LTL formula learning is an open problem. We implement the first GPU-based LTL learner using a novel form of enumerative program synthesis. The learner is sound and complete. Our benchmarks indicate that it handles traces at least 2048 times more numerous, and on average at least 46 times faster than existing state-of-the-art learners. This is achieved with, among others, novel branch-free LTL semantics that has $O(\log n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is trace length, while previous implementations are $O(n^2)$ or worse (assuming bitwise boolean operations and shifts by powers of 2 have unit costs -- a realistic assumption on modern processors).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxin Li, Zeyu Wang, Xu Yang, Yuran Yang, Shuqi Mei, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-goal navigation is a challenging task that requires an agent to navigate to a goal indicated by an image in unfamiliar environments. Existing methods utilizing diverse scene memories suffer from inefficient exploration since they use all historical observations for decision-making without considering the goal-relevant fraction. To address this limitation, we present MemoNav, a novel memory model for image-goal navigation, which utilizes a working memory-inspired pipeline to improve navigation performance. Specifically, we employ three types of navigation memory. The node features on a map are stored in the short-term memory (STM), as these features are dynamically updated. A forgetting module then retains the informative STM fraction to increase efficiency. We also introduce long-term memory (LTM) to learn global scene representations by progressively aggregating STM features. Subsequently, a graph attention module encodes the retained STM and the LTM to generate working memory (WM) which contains the scene features essential for efficient navigation. The synergy among these three memory types boosts navigation performance by enabling the agent to learn and leverage goal-relevant scene features within a topological map. Our evaluation on multi-goal tasks demonstrates that MemoNav significantly outperforms previous methods across all difficulty levels in both Gibson and Matterport3D scenes. Qualitative results further illustrate that MemoNav plans more efficient routes.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01121">OpenGraph: Towards Open Graph Foundation Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghao Xia, Ben Kao, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph learning has become indispensable for interpreting and harnessing relational data in diverse fields, ranging from recommendation systems to social network analysis. In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramin Mousa, Mitra Khezli, Mohamadreza Azadi, Vahid Nikoofard, Saba Hesaraki</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate classification of objects in 3D point clouds is a significant problem in several applications, such as autonomous navigation and augmented/virtual reality scenarios, which has become a research hot spot. In this paper, we presented a deep learning strategy for 3D object classification in augmented reality. The proposed approach is a combination of the GRU and LSTM. LSTM networks learn longer dependencies well, but due to the number of gates, it takes longer to train; on the other hand, GRU networks have a weaker performance than LSTM, but their training speed is much higher than GRU, which is The speed is due to its fewer gates. The proposed approach used the combination of speed and accuracy of these two networks. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 0.99 in the 4,499,0641 points dataset, which includes eight classes (unlabeled, man-made terrain, natural terrain, high vegetation, low vegetation, buildings, hardscape, scanning artifacts, cars). Meanwhile, the traditional machine learning approaches could achieve a maximum accuracy of 0.9489 in the best case.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08059">FluoroSAM: A Language-aligned Foundation Model for X-ray Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin D. Killeen, Liam J. Wang, Han Zhang, Mehran Armand, Russell H. Taylor, Dave Dreizin, Greg Osgood, Mathias Unberath</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated X-ray image segmentation would accelerate research and development in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving specific image analysis problems, but the utility of these models is restricted to their particular task domain, and expanding to broader use requires additional data, labels, and retraining efforts. Recently, foundation models (FMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing FMs for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where objects are clearly defined by visually apparent boundaries, such as surgical tool segmentation in endoscopy. X-ray imaging, by contrast, does not generally offer such clearly delineated boundaries or structure priors. During X-ray image formation, complex 3D structures are projected in transmission onto the imaging plane, resulting in overlapping features of varying opacity and shape. To pave the way toward an FM for comprehensive and automated analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we develop FluoroSAM, a language-aligned variant of the Segment-Anything Model, trained from scratch on 1.6M synthetic X-ray images. FluoroSAM is trained on data including masks for 128 organ types and 464 non-anatomical objects, such as tools and implants. In real X-ray images of cadaveric specimens, FluoroSAM is able to segment bony anatomical structures based on text-only prompting with 0.51 and 0.79 DICE with point-based refinement, outperforming competing SAM variants for all structures. FluoroSAM is also capable of zero-shot generalization to segmenting classes beyond the training set thanks to its language alignment, which we demonstrate for full lung segmentation on real chest X-rays.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinan Deng, Jiahui Wang, Jingyu Zhao, Xinyu Tian, Guangyan Chen, Yi Yang, Yufeng Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Environment representations endowed with sophisticated semantics are pivotal for facilitating seamless interaction between robots and humans, enabling them to effectively carry out various tasks. Open-vocabulary maps, powered by Visual-Language models (VLMs), possess inherent advantages, including zero-shot learning and support for open-set classes. However, existing open-vocabulary maps are primarily designed for small-scale environments, such as desktops or rooms, and are typically geared towards limited-area tasks involving robotic indoor navigation or in-place manipulation. They face challenges in direct generalization to outdoor environments characterized by numerous objects and complex tasks, owing to limitations in both understanding level and map structure. In this work, we propose OpenGraph, the first open-vocabulary hierarchical graph representation designed for large-scale outdoor environments. OpenGraph initially extracts instances and their captions from visual images, enhancing textual reasoning by encoding them. Subsequently, it achieves 3D incremental object-centric mapping with feature embedding by projecting images onto LiDAR point clouds. Finally, the environment is segmented based on lane graph connectivity to construct a hierarchical graph. Validation results from public dataset SemanticKITTI demonstrate that OpenGraph achieves the highest segmentation and query accuracy.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10667">Towards Unified Multi-Modal Personalization: Large Vision-Language Models for Generative Recommendation and Beyond</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxin Wei, Bowen Jin, Ruirui Li, Hansi Zeng, Zhengyang Wang, Jianhui Sun, Qingyu Yin, Hanqing Lu, Suhang Wang, Jingrui He, Xianfeng Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing a universal model that can effectively harness heterogeneous resources and respond to a wide range of personalized needs has been a longstanding community aspiration. Our daily choices, especially in domains like fashion and retail, are substantially shaped by multi-modal data, such as pictures and textual descriptions. These modalities not only offer intuitive guidance but also cater to personalized user preferences. However, the predominant personalization approaches mainly focus on the ID or text-based recommendation problem, failing to comprehend the information spanning various tasks or modalities. In this paper, our goal is to establish a Unified paradigm for Multi-modal Personalization systems (UniMP), which effectively leverages multi-modal data while eliminating the complexities associated with task- and modality-specific customization. We argue that the advancements in foundational generative modeling have provided the flexibility and effectiveness necessary to achieve the objective. In light of this, we develop a generic and extensible personalization generative framework, that can handle a wide range of personalized needs including item recommendation, product search, preference prediction, explanation generation, and further user-guided image generation. Our methodology enhances the capabilities of foundational language models for personalized tasks by seamlessly ingesting interleaved cross-modal user history information, ensuring a more precise and customized experience for users. To train and evaluate the proposed multi-modal personalized tasks, we also introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark covering a variety of user requirements. Our experiments on the real-world benchmark showcase the model's potential, outperforming competitive methods specialized for each task.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12031">RouterBench: A Benchmark for Multi-LLM Routing System</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Jason Hu, Jacob Bieker, Xiuyu Li, Nan Jiang, Benjamin Keigwin, Gaurav Ranganath, Kurt Keutzer, Shriyash Kaustubh Upadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: As the range of applications for Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to grow, the demand for effective serving solutions becomes increasingly critical. Despite the versatility of LLMs, no single model can optimally address all tasks and applications, particularly when balancing performance with cost. This limitation has led to the development of LLM routing systems, which combine the strengths of various models to overcome the constraints of individual LLMs. Yet, the absence of a standardized benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLM routers hinders progress in this area. To bridge this gap, we present RouterBench, a novel evaluation framework designed to systematically assess the efficacy of LLM routing systems, along with a comprehensive dataset comprising over 405k inference outcomes from representative LLMs to support the development of routing strategies. We further propose a theoretical framework for LLM routing, and deliver a comparative analysis of various routing approaches through RouterBench, highlighting their potentials and limitations within our evaluation framework. This work not only formalizes and advances the development of LLM routing systems but also sets a standard for their assessment, paving the way for more accessible and economically viable LLM deployments.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403">Adaptive-RAG: Learning to Adapt Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models through Question Complexity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyeong Jeong, Jinheon Baek, Sukmin Cho, Sung Ju Hwang, Jong C. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs), which incorporate the non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into LLMs, have emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy in several tasks, such as Question-Answering (QA). However, even though there are various approaches dealing with queries of different complexities, they either handle simple queries with unnecessary computational overhead or fail to adequately address complex multi-step queries; yet, not all user requests fall into only one of the simple or complex categories. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive QA framework, that can dynamically select the most suitable strategy for (retrieval-augmented) LLMs from the simplest to the most sophisticated ones based on the query complexity. Also, this selection process is operationalized with a classifier, which is a smaller LM trained to predict the complexity level of incoming queries with automatically collected labels, obtained from actual predicted outcomes of models and inherent inductive biases in datasets. This approach offers a balanced strategy, seamlessly adapting between the iterative and single-step retrieval-augmented LLMs, as well as the no-retrieval methods, in response to a range of query complexities. We validate our model on a set of open-domain QA datasets, covering multiple query complexities, and show that ours enhances the overall efficiency and accuracy of QA systems, compared to relevant baselines including the adaptive retrieval approaches.

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Afroogh, Ali Akbari, Evan Malone, Mohammadali Kargar, Hananeh Alambeigi</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in our daily life through various applications, services, and products explains the significance of trust/distrust in AI from a user perspective. AI-driven systems (as opposed to other technologies) have ubiquitously diffused in our life not only as some beneficial tools to be used by human agents but also are going to be substitutive agents on our behalf, or manipulative minds that would influence human thought, decision, and agency. Trust/distrust in AI plays the role of a regulator and could significantly control the level of this diffusion, as trust can increase, and distrust may reduce the rate of adoption of AI. Recently, varieties of studies have paid attention to the variant dimension of trust/distrust in AI, and its relevant considerations. In this systematic literature review, after conceptualization of trust in the current AI literature review, we will investigate trust in different types of human-Machine interaction, and its impact on technology acceptance in different domains. In addition to that, we propose a taxonomy of technical (i.e., safety, accuracy, robustness) and non-technical axiological (i.e., ethical, legal, and mixed) trustworthiness metrics, and some trustworthy measurements. Moreover, we examine some major trust-breakers in AI (e.g., autonomy and dignity threat), and trust makers; and propose some future directions and probable solutions for the transition to a trustworthy AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose X-Portrait, an innovative conditional diffusion model tailored for generating expressive and temporally coherent portrait animation. Specifically, given a single portrait as appearance reference, we aim to animate it with motion derived from a driving video, capturing both highly dynamic and subtle facial expressions along with wide-range head movements. As its core, we leverage the generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model as the rendering backbone, while achieve fine-grained head pose and expression control with novel controlling signals within the framework of ControlNet. In contrast to conventional coarse explicit controls such as facial landmarks, our motion control module is learned to interpret the dynamics directly from the original driving RGB inputs. The motion accuracy is further enhanced with a patch-based local control module that effectively enhance the motion attention to small-scale nuances like eyeball positions. Notably, to mitigate the identity leakage from the driving signals, we train our motion control modules with scaling-augmented cross-identity images, ensuring maximized disentanglement from the appearance reference modules. Experimental results demonstrate the universal effectiveness of X-Portrait across a diverse range of facial portraits and expressive driving sequences, and showcase its proficiency in generating captivating portrait animations with consistently maintained identity characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minzhou Pan, Zhengting Wang, Xin Dong, Vikash Sehwag, Lingjuan Lyu, Xue Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose WaterMark Detection (WMD), the first invisible watermark detection method under a black-box and annotation-free setting. WMD is capable of detecting arbitrary watermarks within a given reference dataset using a clean non-watermarked dataset as a reference, without relying on specific decoding methods or prior knowledge of the watermarking techniques. We develop WMD using foundations of offset learning, where a clean non-watermarked dataset enables us to isolate the influence of only watermarked samples in the reference dataset. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of WMD, significantly outperforming naive detection methods, which only yield AUC scores around 0.5. In contrast, WMD consistently achieves impressive detection AUC scores, surpassing 0.9 in most single-watermark datasets and exceeding 0.7 in more challenging multi-watermark scenarios across diverse datasets and watermarking methods. As invisible watermarks become increasingly prevalent, while specific decoding techniques remain undisclosed, our approach provides a versatile solution and establishes a path toward increasing accountability, transparency, and trust in our digital visual content.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16591">Deciphering the Interplay between Local Differential Privacy, Average Bayesian Privacy, and Maximum Bayesian Privacy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojin Zhang, Yulin Fei, Wei Chen, Hai Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: The swift evolution of machine learning has led to emergence of various definitions of privacy due to the threats it poses to privacy, including the concept of local differential privacy (LDP). Although widely embraced and utilized across numerous domains, this conventional approach to measure privacy still exhibits certain limitations, spanning from failure to prevent inferential disclosure to lack of consideration for the adversary's background knowledge. In this comprehensive study, we introduce Bayesian privacy and delve into the intricate relationship between LDP and its Bayesian counterparts, unveiling novel insights into utility-privacy trade-offs. We introduce a framework that encapsulates both attack and defense strategies, highlighting their interplay and effectiveness. The relationship between LDP and Maximum Bayesian Privacy (MBP) is first revealed, demonstrating that under uniform prior distribution, a mechanism satisfying $\xi$-LDP will satisfy $\xi$-MBP and conversely $\xi$-MBP also confers 2$\xi$-LDP. Our next theoretical contribution are anchored in the rigorous definitions and relationships between Average Bayesian Privacy (ABP) and Maximum Bayesian Privacy (MBP), encapsulated by equations $\epsilon_{p,a} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{(\epsilon_{p,m} + \epsilon)\cdot(e^{\epsilon_{p,m} + \epsilon} - 1)}$. These relationships fortify our understanding of the privacy guarantees provided by various mechanisms. Our work not only lays the groundwork for future empirical exploration but also promises to facilitate the design of privacy-preserving algorithms, thereby fostering the development of trustworthy machine learning solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azmine Toushik Wasi, Taki Hasan Rafi, Raima Islam, Serbetar Karlo, Dong-Kyu Chae</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) is a pivotal element in the process of drug development. DDIs occur when one drug's properties are affected by the inclusion of other drugs. Detecting favorable DDIs has the potential to pave the way for creating and advancing innovative medications applicable in practical settings. However, existing DDI prediction models continue to face challenges related to generalization in extreme cases, robust feature extraction, and real-life application possibilities. We aim to address these challenges by leveraging the effectiveness of context-aware deep graph learning by introducing a novel framework named CADGL. Based on a customized variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), we capture critical structural and physio-chemical information using two context preprocessors for feature extraction from two different perspectives: local neighborhood and molecular context, in a heterogeneous graphical structure.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17608">Fake or JPEG? Revealing Common Biases in Generated Image Detection Datasets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Grommelt, Louis Weiss, Franz-Josef Pfreundt, Janis Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative image models has highlighted the urgent need to detect artificial content, which is a crucial step in combating widespread manipulation and misinformation. Consequently, numerous detectors and associated datasets have emerged. However, many of these datasets inadvertently introduce undesirable biases, thereby impacting the effectiveness and evaluation of detectors. In this paper, we emphasize that many datasets for AI-generated image detection contain biases related to JPEG compression and image size. Using the GenImage dataset, we demonstrate that detectors indeed learn from these undesired factors. Furthermore, we show that removing the named biases substantially increases robustness to JPEG compression and significantly alters the cross-generator performance of evaluated detectors. Specifically, it leads to more than 11 percentage points increase in cross-generator performance for ResNet50 and Swin-T detectors on the GenImage dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej K Wozniak, Mattias Hansson, Marko Thiel, Patric Jensfelt</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we address a gap in existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches on LiDAR-based 3D object detection, which have predominantly concentrated on adapting between established, high-density autonomous driving datasets. We focus on sparser point clouds, capturing scenarios from different perspectives: not just from vehicles on the road but also from mobile robots on sidewalks, which encounter significantly different environmental conditions and sensor configurations. We introduce Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection (UADA3D). UADA3D does not depend on pre-trained source models or teacher-student architectures. Instead, it uses an adversarial approach to directly learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate its efficacy in various adaptation scenarios, showing significant improvements in both self-driving car and mobile robot domains. Our code is open-source and will be available soon.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17740">All-in-One: Heterogeneous Interaction Modeling for Cold-Start Rating Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuheng Fang, Kangfei Zhao, Yu Rong, Zhixun Li, Jeffrey Xu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cold-start rating prediction is a fundamental problem in recommender systems that has been extensively studied. Many methods have been proposed that exploit explicit relations among existing data, such as collaborative filtering, social recommendations and heterogeneous information network, to alleviate the data insufficiency issue for cold-start users and items. However, the explicit relations constructed based on data between different roles may be unreliable and irrelevant, which limits the performance ceiling of the specific recommendation task. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework dubbed heterogeneous interaction rating network (HIRE). HIRE dose not solely rely on the pre-defined interaction pattern or the manually constructed heterogeneous information network. Instead, we devise a Heterogeneous Interaction Module (HIM) to jointly model the heterogeneous interactions and directly infer the important interactions via the observed data. In the experiments, we evaluate our model under three cold-start settings on three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that HIRE outperforms other baselines by a large margin. Furthermore, we visualize the inferred interactions of HIRE to confirm the contribution of our model.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919">LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Xiang Liu, Shizhe Diao, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Chi Han, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since the first appearance of large language models (LLMs), yet their huge memory consumption has become a major roadblock to large-scale training. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an uncommon skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over $11\%$-$37\%$ in terms of MT-Bench scores. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA achieves on-par or better performance than LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18025">Improving Pre-trained Language Model Sensitivity via Mask Specific losses: A case study on Biomedical NER</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Micheal Abaho, Danushka Bollegala, Gary Leeming, Dan Joyce, Iain E Buchan</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to novel domains is often achieved through fine-tuning a pre-trained LM (PLM) on domain-specific data. Fine-tuning introduces new knowledge into an LM, enabling it to comprehend and efficiently perform a target domain task. Fine-tuning can however be inadvertently insensitive if it ignores the wide array of disparities (e.g in word meaning) between source and target domains. For instance, words such as chronic and pressure may be treated lightly in social conversations, however, clinically, these words are usually an expression of concern. To address insensitive fine-tuning, we propose Mask Specific Language Modeling (MSLM), an approach that efficiently acquires target domain knowledge by appropriately weighting the importance of domain-specific terms (DS-terms) during fine-tuning. MSLM jointly masks DS-terms and generic words, then learns mask-specific losses by ensuring LMs incur larger penalties for inaccurately predicting DS-terms compared to generic words. Results of our analysis show that MSLM improves LMs sensitivity and detection of DS-terms. We empirically show that an optimal masking rate not only depends on the LM, but also on the dataset and the length of sequences. Our proposed masking strategy outperforms advanced masking strategies such as span- and PMI-based masking.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18028">Predicting Species Occurrence Patterns from Partial Observations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hager Radi Abdelwahed, M\'elisande Teng, David Rolnick</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the interlinked biodiversity and climate crises, we need an understanding of where species occur and how these patterns are changing. However, observational data on most species remains very limited, and the amount of data available varies greatly between taxonomic groups. We introduce the problem of predicting species occurrence patterns given (a) satellite imagery, and (b) known information on the occurrence of other species. To evaluate algorithms on this task, we introduce SatButterfly, a dataset of satellite images, environmental data and observational data for butterflies, which is designed to pair with the existing SatBird dataset of bird observational data. To address this task, we propose a general model, R-Tran, for predicting species occurrence patterns that enables the use of partial observational data wherever found. We find that R-Tran outperforms other methods in predicting species encounter rates with partial information both within a taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies). Our approach opens new perspectives to leveraging insights from species with abundant data to other species with scarce data, by modelling the ecosystems in which they co-occur.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18159">Oh! We Freeze: Improving Quantized Knowledge Distillation via Signal Propagation Analysis for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartikeya Bhardwaj, Nilesh Prasad Pandey, Sweta Priyadarshi, Kyunggeun Lee, Jun Ma, Harris Teague</p>
<p>Abstract: Large generative models such as large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models have revolutionized the fields of NLP and computer vision respectively. However, their slow inference, high computation and memory requirement makes it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. In this study, we propose a light-weight quantization aware fine tuning technique using knowledge distillation (KD-QAT) to improve the performance of 4-bit weight quantized LLMs using commonly available datasets to realize a popular language use case, on device chat applications. To improve this paradigm of finetuning, as main contributions, we provide insights into stability of KD-QAT by empirically studying the gradient propagation during training to better understand the vulnerabilities of KD-QAT based approaches to low-bit quantization errors. Based on our insights, we propose ov-freeze, a simple technique to stabilize the KD-QAT process. Finally, we experiment with the popular 7B LLaMAv2-Chat model at 4-bit quantization level and demonstrate that ov-freeze results in near floating point precision performance, i.e., less than 0.7% loss of accuracy on Commonsense Reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18314">Chinese Offensive Language Detection:Current Status and Future Directions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunze Xiao, Houda Bouamor, Wajdi Zaghouani</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the considerable efforts being made to monitor and regulate user-generated content on social media platforms, the pervasiveness of offensive language, such as hate speech or cyberbullying, in the digital space remains a significant challenge. Given the importance of maintaining a civilized and respectful online environment, there is an urgent and growing need for automatic systems capable of detecting offensive speech in real time. However, developing effective systems for processing languages such as Chinese presents a significant challenge, owing to the language's complex and nuanced nature, which makes it difficult to process automatically. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of offensive language detection in Chinese, examining current benchmarks and approaches and highlighting specific models and tools for addressing the unique challenges of detecting offensive language in this complex language. The primary objective of this survey is to explore the existing techniques and identify potential avenues for further research that can address the cultural and linguistic complexities of Chinese.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18755">Many-Objective Evolutionary Influence Maximization: Balancing Spread, Budget, Fairness, and Time</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elia Cunegatti, Leonardo Lucio Custode, Giovanni Iacca</p>
<p>Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem seeks to discover the set of nodes in a graph that can spread the information propagation at most. This problem is known to be NP-hard, and it is usually studied by maximizing the influence (spread) and, optionally, optimizing a second objective, such as minimizing the seed set size or maximizing the influence fairness. However, in many practical scenarios multiple aspects of the IM problem must be optimized at the same time. In this work, we propose a first case study where several IM-specific objective functions, namely budget, fairness, communities, and time, are optimized on top of the maximization of influence and minimization of the seed set size. To this aim, we introduce MOEIM (Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Influence Maximization) a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) based on NSGA-II incorporating graph-aware operators and a smart initialization. We compare MOEIM in two experimental settings, including a total of nine graph datasets, two heuristic methods, a related MOEA, and a state-of-the-art Deep Learning approach. The experiments show that MOEIM overall outperforms the competitors in most of the tested many-objective settings. To conclude, we also investigate the correlation between the objectives, leading to novel insights into the topic. The codebase is available at https://github.com/eliacunegatti/MOEIM.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18807">ECoDepth: Effective Conditioning of Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Suraj Patni, Aradhye Agarwal, Chetan Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: In the absence of parallax cues, a learning-based single image depth estimation (SIDE) model relies heavily on shading and contextual cues in the image. While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such models on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as CLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration from this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information. We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large dataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of generating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based on this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset, achieving Abs Rel error of 0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD). And on KITTI dataset, achieving Sq Rel error of 0.139 (2% improvement) compared to 0.142 by the current SOTA (GEDepth). For zero-shot transfer with a model trained on NYUv2, we report mean relative improvement of (20%, 23%, 81%, 25%) over NeWCRFs on (Sun-RGBD, iBims1, DIODE, HyperSim) datasets, compared to (16%, 18%, 45%, 9%) by ZoeDepth.
