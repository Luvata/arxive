<p><b>Authors:</b> Zining Zhu, Liang Zhao, Kangheng Lin, Jinze Yang, En Yu, Chenglong Liu, Haoran Wei, Jianjian Sun, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Perceptual Preference Optimization (PerPO), a perception alignment method aimed at addressing the visual discrimination challenges in generative pre-trained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To align MLLMs with human visual perception process, PerPO employs discriminative rewarding to gather diverse negative samples, followed by listwise preference optimization to rank them.By utilizing the reward as a quantitative margin for ranking, our method effectively bridges generative preference optimization and discriminative empirical risk minimization. PerPO significantly enhances MLLMs' visual discrimination capabilities while maintaining their generative strengths, mitigates image-unconditional reward hacking, and ensures consistent performance across visual tasks. This work marks a crucial step towards more perceptually aligned and versatile MLLMs. We also hope that PerPO will encourage the community to rethink MLLM alignment strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agency is a system's capacity to steer outcomes toward a goal, and is a central topic of study across biology, philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Determining if a system exhibits agency is a notoriously difficult question: Dennett (1989), for instance, highlights the puzzle of determining which principles can decide whether a rock, a thermostat, or a robot each possess agency. We here address this puzzle from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning by arguing that agency is fundamentally frame-dependent: Any measurement of a system's agency must be made relative to a reference frame. We support this claim by presenting a philosophical argument that each of the essential properties of agency proposed by Barandiaran et al. (2009) and Moreno (2018) are themselves frame-dependent. We conclude that any basic science of agency requires frame-dependence, and discuss the implications of this claim for reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivaxi Sheth, Jan Wehner, Sahar Abdelnabi, Ruta Binkyte, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: AI advancements have been significantly driven by a combination of foundation models and curiosity-driven learning aimed at increasing capability and adaptability. A growing area of interest within this field is Open-Endedness - the ability of AI systems to continuously and autonomously generate novel and diverse artifacts or solutions. This has become relevant for accelerating scientific discovery and enabling continual adaptation in AI agents. This position paper argues that the inherently dynamic and self-propagating nature of Open-Ended AI introduces significant, underexplored risks, including challenges in maintaining alignment, predictability, and control. This paper systematically examines these challenges, proposes mitigation strategies, and calls for action for different stakeholders to support the safe, responsible and successful development of Open-Ended AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Ji, Hanchun Wang, Antonio Filieri, Ilenia Epifani</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic model checking traditionally verifies properties on the expected value of a measure of interest. This restriction may fail to capture the quality of service of a significant proportion of a system's runs, especially when the probability distribution of the measure of interest is poorly represented by its expected value due to heavy-tail behaviors or multiple modalities. Recent works inspired by distributional reinforcement learning use discrete histograms to approximate integer reward distribution, but they struggle with continuous reward space and present challenges in balancing accuracy and scalability. We propose a novel method for handling both continuous and discrete reward distributions in Discrete Time Markov Chains using moment matching with Erlang mixtures. By analytically deriving higher-order moments through Moment Generating Functions, our method approximates the reward distribution with theoretically bounded error while preserving the statistical properties of the true distribution. This detailed distributional insight enables the formulation and robust model checking of quality properties based on the entire reward distribution function, rather than restricting to its expected value. We include a theoretical foundation ensuring bounded approximation errors, along with an experimental evaluation demonstrating our method's accuracy and scalability in practical model-checking problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongliang Chi, Qiong Wu, Zhengyi Zhou, Jonathan Light, Emily Dodwell, Yao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection has emerged as a crucial downstream application of data valuation. While existing data valuation methods have shown promise in selection tasks, the theoretical foundations and full potential of using data values for selection remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first demonstrate that data values applied for selection can be naturally reformulated as a sequential-decision-making problem, where the optimal data value can be derived through dynamic programming. We show this framework unifies and reinterprets existing methods like Data Shapley through the lens of approximate dynamic programming, specifically as myopic reward function approximations to this sequential problem. Furthermore, we analyze how sequential data selection optimality is affected when the ground-truth utility function exhibits monotonic submodularity with curvature. To address the computational challenges in obtaining optimal data values, we propose an efficient approximation scheme using learned bipartite graphs as surrogate utility models, ensuring greedy selection is still optimal when the surrogate utility is correctly specified and learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuotong Chen, Fang Liu, Xuan Zhu, Yanjun Qi, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing studies on preference optimization (PO) have centered on constructing pairwise preference data following simple heuristics, such as maximizing the margin between preferred and dispreferred completions based on human (or AI) ranked scores. However, none of these heuristics has a full theoretical justification. In this work, we develop a novel PO framework that provides theoretical guidance to effectively sample dispreferred completions. To achieve this, we formulate PO as minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a probability model and propose to estimate its normalization constant via a sampling strategy. As we will demonstrate, these estimative samples can act as dispreferred completions in PO. We then select contrastive divergence (CD) as the sampling strategy, and propose a novel MC-PO algorithm that applies the Monte Carlo (MC) kernel from CD to sample hard negatives w.r.t. the parameterized reward model. Finally, we propose the OnMC-PO algorithm, an extension of MC-PO to the online setting. On popular alignment benchmarks, MC-PO outperforms existing SOTA baselines, and OnMC-PO leads to further improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junde Wu, Jiayuan Zhu, Yuyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Agentic Reasoning, a framework that enhances large language model (LLM) reasoning by integrating external tool-using agents. Unlike conventional LLM-based reasoning approaches, which rely solely on internal inference, Agentic Reasoning dynamically engages web search, code execution, and structured reasoning-context memory to solve complex problems requiring deep research and multi-step logical deduction. Our framework introduces the Mind Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to track logical relationships, improving deductive reasoning. Additionally, the integration of web-search and coding agents enables real-time retrieval and computational analysis, enhancing reasoning accuracy and decision-making. Evaluations on PhD-level scientific reasoning (GPQA) and domain-specific deep research tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, including leading retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and closed-source LLMs. Moreover, our results indicate that agentic reasoning improves expert-level knowledge synthesis, test-time scalability, and structured problem-solving.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04671">${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$: Multilingual Proof Data Synthesis and Theorem-Proving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amitayush Thakur, George Tsoukalas, Greg Durrett, Swarat Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have shown substantial promise at automatic theorem-proving in interactive proof assistants (ITPs) like Lean and Coq. However, most neural theorem-proving models are restricted to specific ITPs, leaving out opportunities for cross-lingual $\textit{transfer}$ between ITPs. We address this weakness with a multilingual proof framework, ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$, that allows a standardized form of interaction between neural theorem-provers and two established ITPs (Coq and Lean). It enables the collection of multilingual proof step data -- data recording the result of proof actions on ITP states -- for training neural provers. ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ allows the systematic evaluation of a model's performance across different ITPs and problem domains via efficient parallel proof search algorithms. We show that multilingual training enabled by ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ can lead to successful transfer across ITPs. Specifically, a model trained on a mix of ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$-generated Coq and Lean data outperforms Lean-only and Coq-only models on the standard prove-at-$k$ metric. We open source all code including code for the $\href{https://github.com/trishullab/proof-wala}{ProofWala\; Framework}$, and the $\href{https://github.com/trishullab/itp-interface}{Multilingual\; ITP\; interaction\; framework}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Xinyu Lu, Junjie Yang, Yanjiang Liu, Yaojie Lu, Debing Zhang,  XingYu</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) critique of critique can be easier than critique itself, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) this difficulty relationship is recursively held, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. To examine these hypotheses, we perform Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments across multiple tasks. Our results demonstrate encouraging evidence supporting these hypotheses and suggest that recursive self-critiquing is a promising direction for scalable oversight.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04686">Learning Strategic Language Agents in the Werewolf Game with Iterative Latent Space Policy Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelai Xu, Wanjun Gu, Chao Yu, Yi Wu, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive progress in a variety of domains, including open-ended conversation and multi-step decision-making. However, applying these agents to social deduction games such as Werewolf, which requires both strategic decision-making and free-form language interaction, remains non-trivial. Traditional methods based on Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) or reinforcement learning (RL) typically depend on a predefined action space, making them unsuitable for language games with unconstrained text action space. Meanwhile, pure LLM-based agents often suffer from intrinsic biases and require prohibitively large datasets for fine-tuning. We propose Latent Space Policy Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that addresses these challenges by first mapping free-form text to a discrete latent space, where methods like CFR and RL can learn strategic policy more effectively. We then translate the learned policy back into natural language dialogues, which are used to fine-tune an LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By iteratively alternating between these stages, our LSPO agent progressively enhances both strategic reasoning and language communication. Experiment results on the Werewolf game show that our method improves the agent's performance in each iteration and outperforms existing Werewolf agents, underscoring its promise for free-form language decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratinav Seth, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: This position paper emphasizes the critical gap in the evaluation of Explainable AI (XAI) due to the lack of standardized and reliable metrics, which diminishes its practical value, trustworthiness, and ability to meet regulatory requirements. Current evaluation methods are often fragmented, subjective, and biased, making them prone to manipulation and complicating the assessment of complex models. A central issue is the absence of a ground truth for explanations, complicating comparisons across various XAI approaches. To address these challenges, we advocate for widespread research into developing robust, context-sensitive evaluation metrics. These metrics should be resistant to manipulation, relevant to each use case, and based on human judgment and real-world applicability. We also recommend creating domain-specific evaluation benchmarks that align with the user and regulatory needs of sectors such as healthcare and finance. By encouraging collaboration among academia, industry, and regulators, we can create standards that balance flexibility and consistency, ensuring XAI explanations are meaningful, trustworthy, and compliant with evolving regulations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728">Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhouliang Yu, Yuhuan Yuan, Tim Z. Xiao, Fuxiang Frank Xia, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang, Ge Lin, Weiyang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domain, achieving over 50% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanjia Zhao, Mert Yuksekgonul, Shirley Wu, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to solve complex tasks. However, these systems often rely on fragile, manually designed prompts and heuristics, making optimization difficult. A key challenge in optimizing multi-agent systems is acquiring suitable training data for specialized agents. We introduce SiriuS, a self-improving, reasoning-driven optimization framework for multi-agent systems. Central to our approach is the construction of an experience library: a repository of high-quality reasoning trajectories. The library is built by retaining reasoning steps that lead to successful outcomes, providing a robust training set for optimizing multi-agent system. Additionally, we introduce a library augmentation procedure that refines unsuccessful trajectories, further enriching the library. SiriuS boosts performance by 2.86\% to 21.88\% on reasoning and biomedical QA and enhances agent negotiation in competitive settings. Our results show that SiriuS enhances multi-agent performance while generating reusable data for self-correction and self-play enhancement in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrzej Kaczmarczyk, Davin Choo, Niclas Boehmer, Milind Tambe, Haifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose and study a planning problem we call Sequential Fault-Intolerant Process Planning (SFIPP). SFIPP captures a reward structure common in many sequential multi-stage decision problems where the planning is deemed successful only if all stages succeed. Such reward structures are different from classic additive reward structures and arise in important applications such as drug/material discovery, security, and quality-critical product design. We design provably tight online algorithms for settings in which we need to pick between different actions with unknown success chances at each stage. We do so both for the foundational case in which the behavior of actions is deterministic, and the case of probabilistic action outcomes, where we effectively balance exploration for learning and exploitation for planning through the usage of multi-armed bandit algorithms. In our empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that the specialized algorithms we develop, which leverage additional information about the structure of the SFIPP instance, outperform our more general algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azadeh Alavi, Hossein Akhoundi, Fatemeh Kouchmeshki</p>
<p>Abstract: Could artificial intelligence ever become truly conscious in a functional sense; this paper explores that open-ended question through the lens of Life, a concept unifying classical biological criteria (Oxford, NASA, Koshland) with empirical hallmarks such as adaptive self maintenance, emergent complexity, and rudimentary self referential modeling. We propose a number of metrics for examining whether an advanced AI system has gained consciousness, while emphasizing that we do not claim all AI stems can become conscious. Rather, we suggest that sufficiently advanced architectures exhibiting immune like sabotage defenses, mirror self-recognition analogs, or meta-cognitive updates may cross key thresholds akin to life-like or consciousness-like traits. To demonstrate these ideas, we start by assessing adaptive self-maintenance capability, and introduce controlled data corruption sabotage into the training process. The result demonstrates AI capability to detect these inconsistencies and revert or self-correct analogous to regenerative biological processes. We also adapt an animal-inspired mirror self recognition test to neural embeddings, finding that partially trained CNNs can distinguish self from foreign features with complete accuracy. We then extend our analysis by performing a question-based mirror test on five state-of-the-art chatbots (ChatGPT4, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and Copilot) and demonstrated their ability to recognize their own answers compared to those of the other chatbots.</p>

<p>Abstract: The twenty-first century is a data-driven era where human activities and behavior, physical phenomena, scientific discoveries, technology advancements, and almost everything that happens in the world resulting in massive generation, collection, and utilization of data.
  Connectivity in data is a crucial property. A straightforward example is the World Wide Web, where every webpage is connected to other web pages through hyperlinks, providing a form of directed connectivity. Combinatorial data refers to combinations of data items based on certain connectivity rules. Other forms of combinatorial data include social networks, meshes, community clusters, set systems, and molecules.
  This Ph.D. dissertation focuses on learning and computing with combinatorial data. We study and examine topological and connectivity features within and across connected data to improve the performance of learning and achieve high algorithmic efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tushar Pandey, Ara Ghukasyan, Oktay Goktas, Santosh Kumar Radha</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet their performance is highly dependent on the prompting strategy and model scale. While reinforcement learning and fine-tuning have been deployed to boost reasoning, these approaches incur substantial computational and data overhead. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Graph of Thoughts (AGoT), a dynamic, graph-based inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning solely at test time. Rather than relying on fixed-step methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), AGoT recursively decomposes complex queries into structured subproblems, forming an dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interdependent reasoning steps. By selectively expanding only those subproblems that require further analysis, AGoT unifies the strengths of chain, tree, and graph paradigms into a cohesive framework that allocates computation where it is most needed. We validate our approach on diverse benchmarks spanning multi-hop retrieval, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving, achieving up to 46.2% improvement on scientific reasoning tasks (GPQA) - comparable to gains achieved through computationally intensive reinforcement learning approaches and outperforming state-of-the-art iterative approaches. These results suggest that dynamic decomposition and structured recursion offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to post-training modifications, paving the way for more robust, general-purpose reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In network research, Community Detection has always been a topic of significant interest in network science, with numerous papers and algorithms proposing to uncover the underlying structures within networks. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of several prominent community detection algorithms applied to the SNAP Social Circles Dataset, derived from the Facebook Social Media network. The algorithms implemented include Louvain, Girvan-Newman, Spectral Clustering, K-Means Clustering, etc. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms based on various metrics such as modularity, normalized cut-ratio, silhouette score, compactness, and separability. Our findings reveal insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm in detecting various meaningful communities within the social network, shedding light on their strength and limitations. This research contributes to the understanding of community detection methods and provides valuable guidance for their application in analyzing real-world social networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehan Yan, Tianhao Ma, Ruotai Li, Xinhan Zheng, Guodong Shan, Chisheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a vital role in health protection and disease treatment, but its practical application requires extensive medical knowledge and clinical experience. Existing TCM Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit critical limitations of uncomprehensive medical consultation and diagnoses, and inaccurate syndrome differentiation-based treatment. To address these issues, this study establishes JingFang (JF): a novel TCM Large Language Model that demonstrates the expert-level capability of medical diagnosis and syndrome differentiation-based treatment. We innovate a Multi-agent Dynamic Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Mechanism (MDCCTM) for medical consultation, enabling JF with effective and accurate diagnostic ability. In addition, a Syndrome Agent and a Dual-Stage Retrieval Scheme (DSRS) are developed to significantly enhance the capacity of JF for disease treatment based on syndrome differentiation. JingFang not only facilitates the application of LLMs but also promotes the effective practice of TCM in human health protection and disease treatment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saydul Akbar Murad, Ashim Dahal, Nick Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyber threat detection has become an important area of focus in today's digital age due to the growing spread of fake information and harmful content on social media platforms such as Twitter (now 'X'). These cyber threats, often disguised within tweets, pose significant risks to individuals, communities, and even nations, emphasizing the need for effective detection systems. While previous research has explored tweet-based threats, much of the work is limited to specific languages, domains, or locations, or relies on single-model approaches, reducing their applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. To address these gaps, our study focuses on multi-lingual tweet cyber threat detection using a variety of advanced models. The research was conducted in three stages: (1) We collected and labeled tweet datasets in four languages English, Chinese, Russian, and Arabic employing both manual and polarity-based labeling methods to ensure high-quality annotations. (2) Each dataset was analyzed individually using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to assess their performance on distinct languages. (3) Finally, we combined all four datasets into a single multi-lingual dataset and applied DL and large language model (LLM) architectures to evaluate their efficacy in identifying cyber threats across various languages. Our results show that among machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) attained the highest performance; however, the Bi-LSTM architecture consistently surpassed other DL and LLM architectures across all datasets. These findings underline the effectiveness of Bi-LSTM in multilingual cyber threat detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongwei Li, Xiaoqi Li, Wenkai Li, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As the Ethereum platform continues to mature and gain widespread usage, it is crucial to maintain high standards of smart contract writing practices. While bad practices in smart contracts may not directly lead to security issues, they do elevate the risk of encountering problems. Therefore, to understand and avoid these bad practices, this paper introduces the first systematic study of bad practices in smart contracts, delving into over 35 specific issues. Specifically, we propose a large language models (LLMs)-based framework, SCALM. It combines Step-Back Prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify and address various bad practices effectively. Our extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and datasets have shown that SCALM outperforms existing tools in detecting bad practices in smart contracts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyun Wee, Minjae Park, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of a large language model without any hardware-specific complications, by simply removing several less important transformer blocks. However, our empirical findings suggest that the importance of a transformer block may be highly task-dependent -- a block that is crucial for a task can be removed without degrading the accuracy on another task. Based on this observation, we develop a dynamic depth pruning algorithm, coined PuDDing (Prompt-routed Dynamic Depth Pruning), which determines which blocks to omit from the model based on the input prompt. PuDDing operates by training a lightweight router to predict the best omission set among a set of options, where this option set has also been constructed in a data-driven manner. Empirical results on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PuDDing effectively accelerates the inference language models, and achieves better on-task performance than static depth pruning baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pietro Alessandro Aluffi, Patrick Zietkiewicz, Marya Bazzi, Matt Arderne, Vladimirs Murevics</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed conversational agents, enabling complex human-machine interactions. However, evaluation frameworks often focus on single tasks, failing to capture the dynamic nature of multi-turn dialogues. This paper introduces a dynamic benchmarking framework to assess LLM-based conversational agents through interactions with synthetic users. The framework integrates generative agent simulation to evaluate performance on key dimensions: information extraction, context awareness, and adaptive engagement. By simulating various aspects of user behavior, our work provides a scalable, automated, and flexible benchmarking approach. Experimental evaluation - within a loan application use case - demonstrates the framework's effectiveness under one-shot and few-shot extraction conditions. Results show that adaptive strategies improve data extraction accuracy, especially when handling ambiguous responses. Future work will extend its applicability to broader domains and incorporate additional metrics (e.g., conversational coherence, user engagement). This study contributes a structured, scalable approach to evaluating LLM-based conversational agents, facilitating real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchao Chen, Yilun Hao, Yueying Liu, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods fail to effectively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) between textual reasoning and code generation, leaving symbolic computing capabilities underutilized. We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-round supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks.

<p>Abstract: Named entity recognition (NER) is a core task for historical research in automatically establishing all references to people, places, events and the like. Yet, do to the high linguistic and genre diversity of sources, only limited canonisation of spellings, the level of required historical domain knowledge, and the scarcity of annotated training data, established approaches to natural language processing (NLP) have been both extremely expensive and yielded only unsatisfactory results in terms of recall and precision. Our paper introduces a new approach. We demonstrate how readily-available, state-of-the-art LLMs significantly outperform two leading NLP frameworks, spaCy and flair, for NER in historical documents by seven to twentytwo percent higher F1-Scores. Our ablation study shows how providing historical context to the task and a bit of persona modelling that turns focus away from a purely linguistic approach are core to a successful prompting strategy. We also demonstrate that, contrary to our expectations, providing increasing numbers of examples in few-shot approaches does not improve recall or precision below a threshold of 16-shot. In consequence, our approach democratises access to NER for all historians by removing the barrier of scripting languages and computational skills required for established NLP tools and instead leveraging natural language prompts and consumer-grade tools and frontends.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Hoppe, Filip Ilievski, Jan-Christoph Kalo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, there is a lack of a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Art, as a universal language, can be interpreted in diverse ways, with artworks embodying profound meanings and nuances. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the availability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) raise the question of how these transformative models can be used to assess and interpret the artistic elements of artworks. While research has been conducted in this domain, to the best of our knowledge, a deep and detailed understanding of the technical and expressive features of artworks using LLMs has not been explored. In this study, we investigate the automation of a formal art analysis framework to analyze a high-throughput number of artworks rapidly and examine how their patterns evolve over time. We explore how LLMs can decode artistic expressions, visual elements, composition, and techniques, revealing emerging patterns that develop across periods. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, emphasizing their ability to process vast quantities of art-related data and generate insightful interpretations. Due to the exhaustive and granular nature of the results, we have developed interactive data visualizations, available online https://cognartive.github.io/, to enhance understanding and accessibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyi Shen, Hao Sun, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Ton</p>
<p>Abstract: Building neural reward models from human preferences is a pivotal component in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and large language model alignment research. Given the scarcity and high cost of human annotation, how to select the most informative pairs to annotate is an essential yet challenging open problem. In this work, we highlight the insight that an ideal comparison dataset for reward modeling should balance exploration of the representation space and make informative comparisons between pairs with moderate reward differences. Technically, challenges arise in quantifying the two objectives and efficiently prioritizing the comparisons to be annotated. To address this, we propose the Fisher information-based selection strategies, adapt theories from the classical experimental design literature, and apply them to the final linear layer of the deep neural network-based reward modeling tasks. Empirically, our method demonstrates remarkable performance, high computational efficiency, and stability compared to other selection methods from deep learning and classical statistical literature across multiple open-source LLMs and datasets. Further ablation studies reveal that incorporating cross-prompt comparisons in active reward modeling significantly enhances labeling efficiency, shedding light on the potential for improved annotation strategies in RLHF.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has opened new avenues for automating complex problem-solving tasks such as algorithmic coding and competitive programming. This paper introduces a novel evaluation technique, LLM-ProS, to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) problems. Using a curated dataset of 166 World Finals problems from 2011 to 2024, we benchmark the models' reasoning, accuracy, and efficiency. We evaluate the five models-GPT-4o, Mistral Large, Llama-3.1-405B, and the o1 family, consisting of o1-mini and o1-preview, across critical metrics like correctness, resource utilization, and response calibration. Our results reveal significant differences in the models' abilities to generalize, adapt, and solve novel problems. We also investigated the impact of training methodologies, dataset contamination, and chain-of-thought reasoning on model performance. The findings provide new insights into optimizing LLMs for algorithmic tasks, highlighting both strengths and limitations of current models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In response to the success of proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4, there is a growing interest in developing open, non-proprietary LLMs and AI foundation models (AIFMs) for transparent use in academic, scientific, and non-commercial applications. Despite their inability to match the refined functionalities of their proprietary counterparts, open models hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare applications. In this paper, we examine the prospects of open-source LLMs and AIFMs for developing healthcare applications and make two key contributions. Firstly, we present a comprehensive survey of the current state-of-the-art open-source healthcare LLMs and AIFMs and introduce a taxonomy of these open AIFMs, categorizing their utility across various healthcare tasks. Secondly, to evaluate the general-purpose applications of open LLMs in healthcare, we present a case study on personalized prescriptions. This task is particularly significant due to its critical role in delivering tailored, patient-specific medications that can greatly improve treatment outcomes. In addition, we compare the performance of open-source models with proprietary models in settings with and without Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings suggest that, although less refined, open LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models when paired with grounding techniques such as RAG. Furthermore, to highlight the clinical significance of LLMs-empowered personalized prescriptions, we perform subjective assessment through an expert clinician. We also elaborate on ethical considerations and potential risks associated with the misuse of powerful LLMs and AIFMs, highlighting the need for a cautious and responsible implementation in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial strides in structured tasks through Reinforcement Learning (RL), demonstrating proficiency in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, applying RL in broader domains like chatbots and content generation -- through the process known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) -- presents unique challenges. Reward models in RLHF are critical, acting as proxies that evaluate the alignment of LLM outputs with human intent. Despite advancements, the development of reward models is hindered by challenges such as computational heavy training, costly evaluation, and therefore poor reproducibility. We advocate for using embedding-based input in reward model research as an accelerated solution to those challenges. By leveraging embeddings for reward modeling, we can enhance reproducibility, reduce computational demands on hardware, improve training stability, and significantly reduce training and evaluation costs, hence facilitating fair and efficient comparisons in this active research area. We then show a case study of reproducing existing reward model ensemble research using embedding-based reward models. We discussed future avenues for research, aiming to contribute to safer and more effective LLM deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliot Meyerson, Xin Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjun Li, Natasha Kholgade Banerjee, Sean Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Critical VR applications in domains such as healthcare, education, and finance that use traditional credentials, such as PIN, password, or multi-factor authentication, stand the chance of being compromised if a malicious person acquires the user credentials or if the user hands over their credentials to an ally. Recently, a number of approaches on user authentication have emerged that use motions of VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) and hand controllers during user interactions in VR to represent the user's behavior as a VR biometric signature. One of the fundamental limitations of behavior-based approaches is that current on-device tracking for HMDs and controllers lacks capability to perform tracking of full-body joint articulation, losing key signature data encapsulated by the user articulation. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses 2D body joints, namely shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, acquired from the right side of the participants using an external 2D camera. Using a Transformer-based deep neural network, our method uses the 2D data of body joints that are not tracked by the VR device to predict past and future 3D tracks of the right controller, providing the benefit of augmenting 3D knowledge in authentication. Our approach provides a minimum equal error rate (EER) of 0.025, and a maximum EER drop of 0.040 over prior work that uses single-unit 3D trajectory as the input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yerin Hwang, Yongil Kim, Jahyun Koo, Taegwan Kang, Hyunkyung Bae, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that large language models (LLMs) show exceptional skill in instruction following tasks, this strength can turn into a vulnerability when the models are required to disregard certain instructions. Instruction-following tasks typically involve a clear task description and input text containing the target data to be processed. However, when the input itself resembles an instruction, confusion may arise, even if there is explicit prompting to distinguish between the task instruction and the input. We refer to this phenomenon as instructional distraction. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, named DIM-Bench, specifically designed to assess LLMs' performance under instructional distraction. The benchmark categorizes real-world instances of instructional distraction and evaluates LLMs across four instruction tasks: rewriting, proofreading, translation, and style transfer -- alongside five input tasks: reasoning, code generation, mathematical reasoning, bias detection, and question answering. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs are susceptible to instructional distraction, often failing to accurately follow user intent in such cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have driven the growth of text-guided image editing tools, enabling precise and iterative modifications of synthesized content. However, as these tools become increasingly accessible, they also introduce significant risks of misuse, emphasizing the critical need for robust attribution methods to ensure content authenticity and traceability. Despite the creative potential of such tools, they pose significant challenges for attribution, particularly in adversarial settings where edits can be layered to obscure an image's origins. We propose LambdaTracer, a novel latent-space attribution method that robustly identifies and differentiates authentic outputs from manipulated ones without requiring any modifications to generative or editing pipelines. By adaptively calibrating reconstruction losses, LambdaTracer remains effective across diverse iterative editing processes, whether automated through text-guided editing tools such as InstructPix2Pix and ControlNet or performed manually with editing software such as Adobe Photoshop. Extensive experiments reveal that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in distinguishing maliciously edited images, providing a practical solution to safeguard ownership, creativity, and credibility in the open, fast-evolving AI ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Garc\'ia-Torres, {\O}yvind Meinich-Bache, Siren Rettedal, Kjersti Engan</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximately 10% of newborns need some assistance to start breathing and 5\% proper ventilation. It is crucial that interventions are initiated as soon as possible after birth. Accurate documentation of Time of Birth (ToB) is thereby essential for documenting and improving newborn resuscitation performance. However, current clinical practices rely on manual recording of ToB, typically with minute precision. In this study, we present an AI-driven, video-based system for automated ToB detection using thermal imaging, designed to preserve the privacy of healthcare providers and mothers by avoiding the use of identifiable visual data. Our approach achieves 91.4% precision and 97.4% recall in detecting ToB within thermal video clips during performance evaluation. Additionally, our system successfully identifies ToB in 96% of test cases with an absolute median deviation of 1 second compared to manual annotations. This method offers a reliable solution for improving ToB documentation and enhancing newborn resuscitation outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Wai Kit Chin, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of social media has accelerated the dissemination of information, but it has also facilitated the spread of harmful rumours, which can disrupt economies, influence political outcomes, and exacerbate public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches have shown significant promise in automated rumour detection, they often lack transparency, making their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing graph explainability techniques fall short in addressing the unique challenges posed by the dependencies among feature dimensions in high-dimensional text embeddings used in GNN-based models. In this paper, we introduce Contrastive Token Layerwise Relevance Propagation (CT-LRP), a novel framework designed to enhance the explainability of GNN-based rumour detection. CT-LRP extends current graph explainability methods by providing token-level explanations that offer greater granularity and interpretability. We evaluate the effectiveness of CT-LRP across multiple GNN models trained on three publicly available rumour detection datasets, demonstrating that it consistently produces high-fidelity, meaningful explanations, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy rumour detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxiang Hu, Shurun Yuan, Xiaoting Qin, Jue Zhang, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In contemporary workplaces, meetings are essential for exchanging ideas and ensuring team alignment but often face challenges such as time consumption, scheduling conflicts, and inefficient participation. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning, prompting the question: can LLMs effectively delegate participants in meetings? To explore this, we develop a prototype LLM-powered meeting delegate system and create a comprehensive benchmark using real meeting transcripts. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4/4o maintain balanced performance between active and cautious engagement strategies. In contrast, Gemini 1.5 Pro tends to be more cautious, while Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama3-8B/70B display more active tendencies. Overall, about 60\% of responses address at least one key point from the ground-truth. However, improvements are needed to reduce irrelevant or repetitive content and enhance tolerance for transcription errors commonly found in real-world settings. Additionally, we implement the system in practical settings and collect real-world feedback from demos. Our findings underscore the potential and challenges of utilizing LLMs as meeting delegates, offering valuable insights into their practical application for alleviating the burden of meetings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshuai Hao, Yunfeng Diao, Mengchuan Wei, Yifan Yang, Peng Hao, Rong Yin, Hui Zhang, Weiming Li, Shu Zhao, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Map construction task plays a vital role in providing precise and comprehensive static environmental information essential for autonomous driving systems. Primary sensors include cameras and LiDAR, with configurations varying between camera-only, LiDAR-only, or camera-LiDAR fusion, based on cost-performance considerations. While fusion-based methods typically perform best, existing approaches often neglect modality interaction and rely on simple fusion strategies, which suffer from the problems of misalignment and information loss. To address these issues, we propose MapFusion, a novel multi-modal Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature fusion method for map construction. Specifically, to solve the semantic misalignment problem between camera and LiDAR BEV features, we introduce the Cross-modal Interaction Transform (CIT) module, enabling interaction between two BEV feature spaces and enhancing feature representation through a self-attention mechanism. Additionally, we propose an effective Dual Dynamic Fusion (DDF) module to adaptively select valuable information from different modalities, which can take full advantage of the inherent information between different modalities. Moreover, MapFusion is designed to be simple and plug-and-play, easily integrated into existing pipelines. We evaluate MapFusion on two map construction tasks, including High-definition (HD) map and BEV map segmentation, to show its versatility and effectiveness. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, MapFusion achieves 3.6% and 6.2% absolute improvements on the HD map construction and BEV map segmentation tasks on the nuScenes dataset, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Melhart, Matthew Barthet, Georgios N. Yannakakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Can out-of-the-box pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) detect human affect successfully when observing a video? To address this question, for the first time, we evaluate comprehensively the capacity of popular LLMs to annotate and successfully predict continuous affect annotations of videos when prompted by a sequence of text and video frames in a multimodal fashion. Particularly in this paper, we test LLMs' ability to correctly label changes of in-game engagement in 80 minutes of annotated videogame footage from 20 first-person shooter games of the GameVibe corpus. We run over 2,400 experiments to investigate the impact of LLM architecture, model size, input modality, prompting strategy, and ground truth processing method on engagement prediction. Our findings suggest that while LLMs rightfully claim human-like performance across multiple domains, they generally fall behind capturing continuous experience annotations provided by humans. We examine some of the underlying causes for the relatively poor overall performance, highlight the cases where LLMs exceed expectations, and draw a roadmap for the further exploration of automated emotion labelling via LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenqing Ling, Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we study the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations for both inter- and intra-diversity. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-development for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Kim, Anna Podlasek, Kie Shidara, Feng Liu, Ahmed Alaa, Danilo Bernardo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level accuracy on medical question-answer (QA) benchmarks. However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We describe HypotheSAEs, a general method to hypothesize interpretable relationships between text data (e.g., headlines) and a target variable (e.g., clicks). HypotheSAEs has three steps: (1) train a sparse autoencoder on text embeddings to produce interpretable features describing the data distribution, (2) select features that predict the target variable, and (3) generate a natural language interpretation of each feature (e.g., "mentions being surprised or shocked") using an LLM. Each interpretation serves as a hypothesis about what predicts the target variable. Compared to baselines, our method better identifies reference hypotheses on synthetic datasets (at least +0.06 in F1) and produces more predictive hypotheses on real datasets (~twice as many significant findings), despite requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less compute than recent LLM-based methods. HypotheSAEs also produces novel discoveries on two well-studied tasks: explaining partisan differences in Congressional speeches and identifying drivers of engagement with online headlines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efforts to connect LiDAR data with text, such as LidarCLIP, have primarily focused on embedding 3D point clouds into CLIP text-image space. However, these approaches rely on 3D point clouds, which present challenges in encoding efficiency and neural network processing. With the advent of advanced LiDAR sensors like Ouster OS1, which, in addition to 3D point clouds, produce fixed resolution depth, signal, and ambient panoramic 2D images, new opportunities emerge for LiDAR based tasks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to connect LiDAR data with text by leveraging 2D imagery generated by the OS1 sensor instead of 3D point clouds. Using the Florence 2 large model in a zero-shot setting, we perform image captioning and object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Florence 2 generates more informative captions and achieves superior performance in object detection tasks compared to existing methods like CLIP. By combining advanced LiDAR sensor data with a large pre-trained model, our approach provides a robust and accurate solution for challenging detection scenarios, including real-time applications requiring high accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyao Zheng, Michael A. Jacobs, Vladimir Braverman, Vishwa S. Parekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized medical imaging by enabling efficient and generalizable feature extraction from large-scale unlabeled datasets. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been extended to three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) data, generating compact, information-rich embeddings with 1408 features that achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as intracranial hemorrhage detection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, these embeddings have been shown to encode demographic information, such as age, sex, and race, which poses a significant risk to the fairness of clinical applications.
  In this work, we propose a Variation Autoencoder (VAE) based adversarial debiasing framework to transform these embeddings into a new latent space where demographic information is no longer encoded, while maintaining the performance of critical downstream tasks. We validated our approach on the NLST lung cancer screening dataset, demonstrating that the debiased embeddings effectively eliminate multiple encoded demographic information and improve fairness without compromising predictive accuracy for lung cancer risk at 1-year and 2-year intervals. Additionally, our approach ensures the embeddings are robust against adversarial bias attacks. These results highlight the potential of adversarial debiasing techniques to ensure fairness and equity in clinical applications of self-supervised 3D CT embeddings, paving the way for their broader adoption in unbiased medical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Royson Lee, Minyoung Kim, Fady Rezk, Rui Li, Stylianos I. Venieris, Timothy Hospedales</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing a range of existing FL methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificially intelligent (AI) agents that are capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across domains like transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in AI systems' design and deployment driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives introduces a crucial challenge: how can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to dynamically adjust their objectives, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through this paper, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shue Shiinoki, Ryo Koshihara, Hayato Motegi, Masumi Morishige</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagrams play a crucial role in visually conveying complex relationships and processes within business documentation. Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various image understanding tasks, accurately identifying and extracting the structures and relationships depicted in diagrams continues to pose significant challenges. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a text-driven approach that bypasses reliance on VLMs' visual recognition capabilities. Instead, it utilizes the editable source files--such as xlsx, pptx or docx--where diagram elements (e.g., shapes, lines, annotations) are preserved as textual metadata. In our proof-of-concept, we extracted diagram information from xlsx-based system design documents and transformed the extracted shape data into textual input for Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allowed the LLM to analyze relationships and generate responses to business-oriented questions without the bottleneck of image-based processing. Experimental comparisons with a VLM-based method demonstrated that the proposed text-driven framework yielded more accurate answers for questions requiring detailed comprehension of diagram structures.The results obtained in this study are not limited to the tested .xlsx files but can also be extended to diagrams in other documents with source files, such as Office pptx and docx formats. These findings highlight the feasibility of circumventing VLM constraints through direct textual extraction from original source files. By enabling robust diagram understanding through LLMs, our method offers a promising path toward enhanced workflow efficiency and information analysis in real-world business scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Clemente, Zied Ben Houidi, Alexis Huet, Dario Rossi, Giulio Franzese, Pietro Michiardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) struggle to continually update their knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, humans effortlessly integrate new information, detect conflicts with existing beliefs, and selectively update their mental models. This paper introduces a cognitive-inspired investigation paradigm to study continual knowledge updating in LLMs. We implement two key components inspired by human cognition: (1) Dissonance and Familiarity Awareness, analyzing model behavior to classify information as novel, familiar, or dissonant; and (2) Targeted Network Updates, which track neural activity to identify frequently used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. Through carefully designed experiments in controlled settings, we uncover a number of empirical findings demonstrating the potential of this approach. First, dissonance detection is feasible using simple activation and gradient features, suggesting potential for cognitive-inspired training. Second, we find that non-dissonant updates largely preserve prior knowledge regardless of targeting strategy, revealing inherent robustness in LLM knowledge integration. Most critically, we discover that dissonant updates prove catastrophically destructive to the model's knowledge base, indiscriminately affecting even information unrelated to the current updates. This suggests fundamental limitations in how neural networks handle contradictions and motivates the need for new approaches to knowledge updating that better mirror human cognitive mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Face parsing is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling applications such as identity verification, facial editing, and controllable image synthesis. However, existing face parsing models often lack fairness and robustness, leading to biased segmentation across demographic groups and errors under occlusions, noise, and domain shifts. These limitations affect downstream face synthesis, where segmentation biases can degrade generative model outputs. We propose a multi-objective learning framework that optimizes accuracy, fairness, and robustness in face parsing. Our approach introduces a homotopy-based loss function that dynamically adjusts the importance of these objectives during training. To evaluate its impact, we compare multi-objective and single-objective U-Net models in a GAN-based face synthesis pipeline (Pix2PixHD). Our results show that fairness-aware and robust segmentation improves photorealism and consistency in face generation. Additionally, we conduct preliminary experiments using ControlNet, a structured conditioning model for diffusion-based synthesis, to explore how segmentation quality influences guided image generation. Our findings demonstrate that multi-objective face parsing improves demographic consistency and robustness, leading to higher-quality GAN-based synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of web content has made on-device AI assistants indispensable for helping users manage the increasing complexity of online tasks. The emergent reasoning ability in large language models offer a promising path for next-generation on-device AI agents. However, deploying full-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-limited local devices is challenging. In this paper, we propose Division-of-Thoughts (DoT), a collaborative reasoning framework leveraging the synergy between locally deployed Smaller-scale Language Models (SLMs) and cloud-based LLMs. DoT leverages a Task Decomposer to elicit the inherent planning abilities in language models to decompose user queries into smaller sub-tasks, which allows hybrid language models to fully exploit their respective strengths. Besides, DoT employs a Task Scheduler to analyze the pair-wise dependency of sub-tasks and create a dependency graph, facilitating parallel reasoning of sub-tasks and the identification of key steps. To allocate the appropriate model based on the difficulty of sub-tasks, DoT leverages a Plug-and-Play Adapter, which is an additional task head attached to the SLM that does not alter the SLM's parameters. To boost adapter's task allocation capability, we propose a self-reinforced training method that relies solely on task execution feedback. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our DoT significantly reduces LLM costs while maintaining competitive reasoning accuracy. Specifically, DoT reduces the average reasoning time and API costs by 66.12% and 83.57%, while achieving comparable reasoning accuracy with the best baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Mo, Jacqueline C. K. Lam, Victor O. K. Li, Lawrence Y. L. Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. Low-cost, accurate identification of key markers of AD is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention. Language impairment is one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline, which can be used to discriminate AD patients from normal control individuals. Patient-interviewer dialogues may be used to detect such impairments, but they are often mixed with ambiguous, noisy, and irrelevant information, making the AD detection task difficult. Moreover, the limited availability of AD speech samples and variability in their speech styles pose significant challenges in developing robust speech-based AD detection models. To address these challenges, we propose DECT, a novel speech-based domain-specific approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) for fine-grained linguistic analysis and label-switched label-preserved data generation. Our study presents four novelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and distill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts, effectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent linguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured and heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of LLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic patterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the robustness of AD detection models. We use the augmented AD textual speech transcript dataset and a more fine-grained representation of AD textual speech transcript data to fine-tune the AD detection model. The results have shown that DECT demonstrates superior model performance with an 11% improvement in AD detection accuracy on the datasets from DementiaBank compared to the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaorui Su, Shvat Messica, Yepeng Huang, Ruth Johnson, Lukas Fesser, Shanghua Gao, Faryad Sahneh, Marinka Zitnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.30% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bokeng Zheng, Bo Rao, Tianxiang Zhu, Chee Wei Tan, Jingpu Duan, Zhi Zhou, Xu Chen, Xiaoxi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs), are increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the evolution of urban living.Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Gai, Mohan Wang, Jing Yu, Dongjue Wang, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models on multimodal data while ensuring clients' privacy. However, modality and task heterogeneity hinder clients from learning a unified representation, weakening local model generalization, especially in MFL with mixed modalities where only some clients have multimodal data. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based Multimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities and heterogeneous tasks to address the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through adaptively-constructed prototypes without a prior public dataset. Clients adaptively select prototype construction methods in line with tasks; server converts client prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and aggregates them to form global prototypes, avoid clients keeping unified labels. We divide the model into various modules and only aggregate mapping modules to reduce communication and computation overhead. To address aggregation issues in heterogeneity, we develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust aggregation weights. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence effectiveness of AproMFL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccol\`o Grillo, Andrea Toccaceli, Jo\"el Mathys, Benjamin Estermann, Stefania Fresca, Roger Wattenhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite incredible progress, many neural architectures fail to properly generalize beyond their training distribution. As such, learning to reason in a correct and generalizable way is one of the current fundamental challenges in machine learning. In this respect, logic puzzles provide a great testbed, as we can fully understand and control the learning environment. Thus, they allow to evaluate performance on previously unseen, larger and more difficult puzzles that follow the same underlying rules. Since traditional approaches often struggle to represent such scalable logical structures, we propose to model these puzzles using a graph-based approach. Then, we investigate the key factors enabling the proposed models to learn generalizable solutions in a reinforcement learning setting. Our study focuses on the impact of the inductive bias of the architecture, different reward systems and the role of recurrent modeling in enabling sequential reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how these elements contribute to successful extrapolation on increasingly complex puzzles.These insights and frameworks offer a systematic way to design learning-based systems capable of generalizable reasoning beyond interpolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao-Wen Yang, Xuan-Yi Zhu, Wen-Da Wei, Ding-Chu Zhang, Jie-Jing Shao, Zhi Zhou, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of slow-thinking mechanisms into large language models (LLMs) offers a promising way toward achieving Level 2 AGI Reasoners, as exemplified by systems like OpenAI's o1. However, several significant challenges remain, including inefficient overthinking and an overreliance on auxiliary reward models. We point out that these limitations stem from LLMs' inability to internalize the search process, a key component of effective reasoning. A critical step toward addressing this issue is enabling LLMs to autonomously determine when and where to backtrack, a fundamental operation in traditional search algorithms. To this end, we propose a self-backtracking mechanism that equips LLMs with the ability to backtrack during both training and inference. This mechanism not only enhances reasoning ability but also efficiency by transforming slow-thinking processes into fast-thinking through self-improvement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposal significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, achieving a performance gain of over 40 percent compared to the optimal-path supervised fine-tuning method. We believe this study introduces a novel and promising pathway for developing more advanced and robust Reasoners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Chen, Xiaotian Song, Andy Song, BaDong Chen, Jiancheng Lv, Yanan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models have been shown as a good alternative to LLMs in various scenarios. Existing methods for creating Spiking LLMs, i.e., direct training and ANN-SNN conversion, often suffer from performance degradation and relatively high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Fast ANN-SNN conversion strategy (FAS) that transforms LLMs into spiking LLMs in two stages. The first stage employs a full-parameter fine-tuning of pre-trained models, so it does not need any direct training from scratch. The second stage introduces a coarse-to-fine calibration method to reduce conversion errors and improve accuracy. Our experiments on both language and vision-language tasks across four different scales of LLMs demonstrate that FAS can achieve state-of-the-art performance yet with significantly reduced inference latency and computational costs. For example, FAS only takes 8 timesteps to achieve an accuracy of 3% higher than that of the OPT-7B model, while reducing energy consumption by 96.63%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural PDEs offer efficient alternatives to computationally expensive numerical PDE solvers for simulating complex physical systems. However, their lack of robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) limits deployment in critical applications. We introduce a model-agnostic, physics-informed conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides guaranteed uncertainty estimates without requiring labelled data. By utilising a physics-based approach, we are able to quantify and calibrate the model's inconsistencies with the PDE rather than the uncertainty arising from the data. Our approach uses convolutional layers as finite-difference stencils and leverages physics residual errors as nonconformity scores, enabling data-free UQ with marginal and joint coverage guarantees across prediction domains for a range of complex PDEs. We further validate the efficacy of our method on neural PDE models for plasma modelling and shot design in fusion reactors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Kakooee, Benjamin Dillenburger</p>
<p>Abstract: Space layout design (SLD), occurring in the early stages of the design process, nonetheless influences both the functionality and aesthetics of the ultimate architectural outcome. The complexity of SLD necessitates innovative approaches to efficiently explore vast solution spaces. While image-based generative AI has emerged as a potential solution, they often rely on pixel-based space composition methods that lack intuitive representation of architectural processes. This paper leverages deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), as it offers a procedural approach that intuitively mimics the process of human designers. Effectively using RL for SLD requires an explorative space composing method to generate desirable design solutions. We introduce "laser-wall", a novel space partitioning method that conceptualizes walls as emitters of imaginary light beams to partition spaces. This approach bridges vector-based and pixel-based partitioning methods, offering both flexibility and exploratory power in generating diverse layouts. We present two planning strategies: one-shot planning, which generates entire layouts in a single pass, and dynamic planning, which allows for adaptive refinement by continuously transforming laser-walls. Additionally, we introduce on-light and off-light wall transformations for smooth and fast layout refinement, as well as identity-less and identity-full walls for versatile room assignment. We developed SpaceLayoutGym, an open-source OpenAI Gym compatible simulator for generating and evaluating space layouts. The RL agent processes the input design scenarios and generates solutions following a reward function that balances geometrical and topological requirements. Our results demonstrate that the RL-based laser-wall approach can generate diverse and functional space layouts that satisfy both geometric constraints and topological requirements and is architecturally intuitive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Ferrante, Alessandra Carosi, Rolando Maria D Angelillo, Nicola Toschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiotherapy is a crucial cancer treatment that demands precise planning to balance tumor eradication and preservation of healthy tissue. Traditional treatment planning (TP) is iterative, time-consuming, and reliant on human expertise, which can potentially introduce variability and inefficiency. We propose a novel framework to transform a large multimodal foundation model (MLM) into an action model for TP using a few-shot reinforcement learning (RL) approach. Our method leverages the MLM's extensive pre-existing knowledge of physics, radiation, and anatomy, enhancing it through a few-shot learning process. This allows the model to iteratively improve treatment plans using a Monte Carlo simulator. Our results demonstrate that this method outperforms conventional RL-based approaches in both quality and efficiency, achieving higher reward scores and more optimal dose distributions in simulations on prostate cancer data. This proof-of-concept suggests a promising direction for integrating advanced AI models into clinical workflows, potentially enhancing the speed, quality, and standardization of radiotherapy treatment planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunfeng Lai, Zhenheng Tang, Xinglin Pan, Peijie Dong, Xiang Liu, Haolan Chen, Li Shen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Dong, Yao Xiao, Pengxu Wei, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation have recently been achieved with the emergence of diffusion models. These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuejiao Zhao, Siyan Liu, Su-Yin Yang, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance by scaling model parameters, but this comes with significant inference overhead. Feed-forward networks (FFNs), which dominate LLM parameters, exhibit high activation sparsity in hidden neurons. To exploit this, researchers have proposed using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, where only a subset of parameters is activated. However, existing approaches often require extensive training data and resources, limiting their practicality. We propose CMoE (Carved MoE), a novel framework to efficiently carve MoE models from dense models. CMoE achieves remarkable performance through efficient expert grouping and lightweight adaptation. First, neurons are grouped into shared and routed experts based on activation rates. Next, we construct a routing mechanism without training from scratch, incorporating a differentiable routing process and load balancing. Using modest data, CMoE produces a well-designed, usable MoE from a 7B dense model within five minutes. With lightweight fine-tuning, it achieves high-performance recovery in under an hour.

<p>Abstract: The transportation sector significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating accurate emission models to guide mitigation strategies. Despite its field validation and certification, the industry-standard Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) faces challenges related to complexity in usage, high computational demands, and its unsuitability for microscopic real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present NeuralMOVES, a comprehensive suite of high-performance, lightweight surrogate models for vehicle CO2 emissions. Developed based on reverse engineering and Neural Networks, NeuralMOVES achieves a remarkable 6.013% Mean Average Percentage Error relative to MOVES across extensive tests spanning over two million scenarios with diverse trajectories and the factors regarding environments and vehicles. NeuralMOVES is only 2.4 MB, largely condensing the original MOVES and the reverse engineered MOVES into a compact representation, while maintaining high accuracy. Therefore, NeuralMOVES significantly enhances accessibility while maintaining the accuracy of MOVES, simplifying CO2 evaluation for transportation analyses and enabling real-time, microscopic applications across diverse scenarios without reliance on complex software or extensive computational resources. Moreover, this paper provides, for the first time, a framework for reverse engineering industrial-grade software tailored specifically to transportation scenarios, going beyond MOVES.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of autotelic Reinforcement Learning (RL), emphasizing the role of intrinsic motivations in the open-ended formation of skill repertoires. We delineate the distinctions between knowledge-based and competence-based intrinsic motivations, illustrating how these concepts inform the development of autonomous agents capable of generating and pursuing self-defined goals. The typology of Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) is explored, with a focus on the implications for multi-goal RL and developmental robotics. The autotelic learning problem is framed within a reward-free Markov Decision Process (MDP), WHERE agents must autonomously represent, generate, and master their own goals. We address the unique challenges in evaluating such agents, proposing various metrics for measuring exploration, generalization, and robustness in complex environments. This work aims to advance the understanding of autotelic RL agents and their potential for enhancing skill acquisition in a diverse and dynamic setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaomiao Li, Hao Chen, Yang Wang, Tingyuan Zhu, Weijia Zhang, Kaijie Zhu, Kam-Fai Wong, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets via large language models (LLMs) themselves has emerged as a promising approach to improve LLM performance. However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an approach to identifying which ransomware adversaries are most likely to target specific entities, thereby assisting these entities in formulating better protection strategies. Ransomware poses a formidable cybersecurity threat characterized by profit-driven motives, a complex underlying economy supporting criminal syndicates, and the overt nature of its attacks. This type of malware has consistently ranked among the most prevalent, with a rapid escalation in activity observed. Recent estimates indicate that approximately two-thirds of organizations experienced ransomware attacks in 2023 \cite{Sophos2023Ransomware}. A central tactic in ransomware campaigns is publicizing attacks to coerce victims into paying ransoms. Our study utilizes public disclosures from ransomware victims to predict the likelihood of an entity being targeted by a specific ransomware variant. We employ a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that uses a unique chain-of-thought, multi-shot prompt methodology to define adversary SKRAM (Skills, Knowledge, Resources, Authorities, and Motivation) profiles from ransomware bulletins, threat reports, and news items. This analysis is enriched with publicly available victim data and is further enhanced by a heuristic for generating synthetic data that reflects victim profiles. Our work culminates in the development of a machine learning model that assists organizations in prioritizing ransomware threats and formulating defenses based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the most likely attackers.</p>

A de-identified dataset of 2,086 orthopedic referrals from the University of Texas Health at Tyler was analyzed using machine learning models built on Base General Embeddings (BGE) for semantic extraction. To ensure real-world applicability, noise tolerance experiments were conducted, and oversampling techniques were employed to mitigate class imbalance. The selected optimum and parsimonious embedding model demonstrated high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.874, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): 0.540), effectively distinguishing patients requiring surgical intervention. Dimensionality reduction techniques confirmed the model's ability to capture meaningful clinical relationships. A threshold sensitivity analysis identified an optimal decision threshold (0.30) to balance precision and recall, maximizing referral efficiency. In the predictive modeling analysis, the procedure rate increased from 11.27% to an optimal 60.1%, representing a 433% improvement with significant implications for operational efficiency and healthcare revenue.
  The results of our study demonstrate that referral optimization can enhance primary and surgical care integration. Through this approach, precise and timely predictions of procedural requirements can be made, thereby minimizing delays, improving surgical planning, and reducing administrative burdens. In addition, the findings highlight the potential of clinical decision support as a scalable solution for improving patient outcomes and the efficiency of the healthcare system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Hu, Yucheng Zhou, Lianzhong You, Hongbo Xu, Qianning Wang, Zheng Lian, Fei Richard Yu, Fei Ma, Laizhong Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: With the integration of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into robotic systems and various AI applications, embedding emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities into these models is essential for enabling robots to effectively address human emotional needs and interact seamlessly in real-world scenarios. Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Loru, Jacopo Nudo, Niccol\`o Di Marco, Matteo Cinelli, Walter Quattrociocchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assess news credibility, yet little is known about how they make these judgments. While prior research has examined political bias in LLM outputs or their potential for automated fact-checking, their internal evaluation processes remain largely unexamined. Understanding how LLMs assess credibility provides insights into AI behavior and how credibility is structured and applied in large-scale language models. This study benchmarks the reliability and political classifications of state-of-the-art LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google), GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), and LLaMA 3.1 (Meta) - against structured, expert-driven rating systems such as NewsGuard and Media Bias Fact Check. Beyond assessing classification performance, we analyze the linguistic markers that shape LLM decisions, identifying which words and concepts drive their evaluations. We uncover patterns in how LLMs associate credibility with specific linguistic features by examining keyword frequency, contextual determinants, and rank distributions. Beyond static classification, we introduce a framework in which LLMs refine their credibility assessments by retrieving external information, querying other models, and adapting their responses. This allows us to investigate whether their assessments reflect structured reasoning or rely primarily on prior learned associations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Neng Chuang, Leisheng Yu, Guanchu Wang, Lizhe Zhang, Zirui Liu, Xuanting Cai, Yang Sui, Vladimir Braverman, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed and democratized on edge devices. To improve the efficiency of on-device deployment, small language models (SLMs) are often adopted due to their efficient decoding latency and reduced energy consumption. However, these SLMs often generate inaccurate responses when handling complex queries. One promising solution is uncertainty-based SLM routing, offloading high-stakes queries to stronger LLMs when resulting in low-confidence responses on SLM. This follows the principle of "If you lack confidence, seek stronger support" to enhance reliability. Relying on more powerful LLMs is yet effective but increases invocation costs. Therefore, striking a routing balance between efficiency and efficacy remains a critical challenge. Additionally, efficiently generalizing the routing strategy to new datasets remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into benchmarking and generalization of uncertainty-driven routing strategies from SLMs to LLMs over 1500+ settings. Our findings highlight: First, uncertainty-correctness alignment in different uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods significantly impacts routing performance. Second, uncertainty distributions depend more on both the specific SLM and the chosen UQ method, rather than downstream data. Building on the insight, we propose a calibration data construction instruction pipeline and open-source a constructed hold-out set to enhance routing generalization on new downstream scenarios. The experimental results indicate calibration data effectively bootstraps routing performance without any new data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Della Libera, Francesco Paissan, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imad Eddine Marouf, Enzo Tartaglione, Stephane Lathuiliere, Joost van de Weijer</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning in Visual Question Answering (VQACL) requires models to learn new visual-linguistic tasks (plasticity) while retaining knowledge from previous tasks (stability). The multimodal nature of VQACL presents unique challenges, requiring models to balance stability across visual and textual domains while maintaining plasticity to adapt to novel objects and reasoning tasks. Existing methods, predominantly designed for unimodal tasks, often struggle to balance these demands effectively. In this work, we introduce QUestion-only replay with Attention Distillation (QUAD), a novel approach for VQACL that leverages only past task questions for regularisation, eliminating the need to store visual data and addressing both memory and privacy concerns. QUAD achieves stability by introducing a question-only replay mechanism that selectively uses questions from previous tasks to prevent overfitting to the current task's answer space, thereby mitigating the out-of-answer-set problem. Complementing this, we propose attention consistency distillation, which uniquely enforces both intra-modal and inter-modal attention consistency across tasks, preserving essential visual-linguistic associations. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and NExT-QA demonstrate that QUAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust performance in continual VQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillem Arias, Ramon Baldrich, Maria Vanrell</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores how color is encoded in CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) which is currently the most influential VML (Visual Language model) in Artificial Intelligence. After performing different experiments on synthetic datasets created for this task, we conclude that CLIP is able to attribute correct color labels to colored visual stimulus, but, we come across two main deficiencies: (a) a clear bias on achromatic stimuli that are poorly related to the color concept, thus white, gray and black are rarely assigned as color labels; and (b) the tendency to prioritize text over other visual information. Here we prove it is highly significant in color labelling through an exhaustive Stroop-effect test. With the aim to find the causes of these color deficiencies, we analyse the internal representation at the neuron level. We conclude that CLIP presents an important amount of neurons selective to text, specially in deepest layers of the network, and a smaller amount of multi-modal color neurons which could be the key of understanding the concept of color properly. Our investigation underscores the necessity of refining color representation mechanisms in neural networks to foster a more comprehensive comprehension of colors as humans understand them, thereby advancing the efficacy and versatility of multimodal models like CLIP in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Chen, Amy Zhang, Adriana Romero-Soriano</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation abilities of text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced, yielding highly photo-realistic images from descriptive text and increasing the viability of leveraging synthetic images to train computer vision models. To serve as effective training data, generated images must be highly realistic while also sufficiently diverse within the support of the target data distribution. Yet, state-of-the-art conditional image generation models have been primarily optimized for creative applications, prioritizing image realism and prompt adherence over conditional diversity. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the diversity of generated images with the goal of increasing their effectiveness to train downstream image classification models, without fine-tuning the image generation model. We find that conditioning the generation process on an augmented real image and text prompt produces generations that serve as effective synthetic datasets for downstream training. Conditioning on real training images contextualizes the generation process to produce images that are in-domain with the real image distribution, while data augmentations introduce visual diversity that improves the performance of the downstream classifier. We validate augmentation-conditioning on a total of five established long-tail and few-shot image classification benchmarks and show that leveraging augmentations to condition the generation process results in consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on the long-tailed benchmark and remarkable gains in extreme few-shot regimes of the remaining four benchmarks. These results constitute an important step towards effectively leveraging synthetic data for downstream training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Deshmukh, Shuo Han, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and explaining differences between audio recordings is crucial for fields like audio forensics, quality assessment, and audio generation. This involves identifying and describing audio events, acoustic scenes, signal characteristics, and their emotional impact on listeners. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively study the task of explaining audio differences and then propose benchmark, baselines for the task. First, we present two new datasets for audio difference explanation derived from the AudioCaps and Clotho audio captioning datasets. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate three levels of difference explanations: (1) concise descriptions of audio events and objects, (2) brief sentences about audio events, acoustic scenes, and signal properties, and (3) comprehensive explanations that include semantics and listener emotions. For the baseline, we use prefix tuning where audio embeddings from two audio files are used to prompt a frozen language model. Our empirical analysis and ablation studies reveal that the naive baseline struggles to distinguish perceptually similar sounds and generate detailed tier 3 explanations. To address these limitations, we propose ADIFF, which introduces a cross-projection module, position captioning, and a three-step training process to enhance the model's ability to produce detailed explanations. We evaluate our model using objective metrics and human evaluation and show our model enhancements lead to significant improvements in performance over naive baseline and SoTA Audio-Language Model (ALM) Qwen Audio. Lastly, we conduct multiple ablation studies to study the effects of cross-projection, language model parameters, position captioning, third stage fine-tuning, and present our findings. Our benchmarks, findings, and strong baseline pave the way for nuanced and human-like explanations of audio differences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katarzyna Kobalczyk, Nicolas Astorga, Tennison Liu, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) across various benchmarks, their ability to address ambiguously specified problems--frequent in real-world interactions--remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a formal definition of task ambiguity and frame the problem of task disambiguation through the lens of Bayesian Experimental Design. By posing clarifying questions, LLM agents can acquire additional task specifications, progressively narrowing the space of viable solutions and reducing the risk of generating unsatisfactory outputs. Yet, generating effective clarifying questions requires LLM agents to engage in a form of meta-cognitive reasoning, an ability LLMs may presently lack. Our proposed approach of active task disambiguation enables LLM agents to generate targeted questions maximizing the information gain. Effectively, this approach shifts the load from implicit to explicit reasoning about the space of viable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that this form of question selection leads to more effective task disambiguation in comparison to approaches relying on reasoning solely within the space of questions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated that extended inference through techniques can markedly improve performance, yet these gains come with increased computational costs and the propagation of inherent biases found in natural languages. This paper explores the design of a unified AI-centric language system that addresses these challenges by offering a more concise, unambiguous, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional human languages. We analyze the limitations of natural language such as gender bias, morphological irregularities, and contextual ambiguities and examine how these issues are exacerbated within current Transformer architectures, where redundant attention heads and token inefficiencies prevail. Drawing on insights from emergent artificial communication systems and constructed languages like Esperanto and Lojban, we propose a framework that translates diverse natural language inputs into a streamlined AI-friendly language, enabling more efficient model training and inference while reducing memory footprints. Finally, we outline a pathway for empirical validation through controlled experiments, paving the way for a universal interchange format that could revolutionize AI-to-AI and human-to-AI interactions by enhancing clarity, fairness, and overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Arabzadeh, Farshad Almasganj, Mohammad Mahdi Ahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods have been widely used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using recorded signals from Iner-tial Measurement Units (IMUs) sensors that are installed on various parts of the human body. For this type of HAR, sev-eral challenges exist, the most significant of which is the analysis of multivarious IMU sensors data. Here, we introduce a Hierarchically Unsupervised Fusion (HUF) model designed to extract, and fuse features from IMU sensors data via a hybrid structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)s and Autoencoders (AE)s. First, we design a stack CNN-AE to embed short-time signals into sets of high dimensional features. Second, we develop another CNN-AE network to locally fuse the extracted features from each sensor unit. Finally, we unify all the sensor features through a third CNN-AE architecture as globally feature fusion to create a unique feature set. Additionally, we analyze the effects of varying the model hyperparameters. The best results are achieved with eight convolutional layers in each AE. Furthermore, it is determined that an overcomplete AE with 256 kernels in the code layer is suitable for feature extraction in the first block of the proposed HUF model; this number reduces to 64 in the last block of the model to customize the size of the applied features to the classifier. The tuned model is applied to the UCI-HAR, DaLiAc, and Parkinson's disease gait da-tasets, achieving the classification accuracies of 97%, 97%, and 88%, respectively, which are nearly 3% better com-pared to the state-of-the-art supervised methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method of transferring knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a small "student" model. KD can be divided into two categories: prediction matching and intermediate-layer matching. We explore an intriguing phenomenon: layer-selection strategy does not matter (much) in intermediate-layer matching. In this paper, we show that seemingly nonsensical matching strategies such as matching the teacher's layers in reverse still result in surprisingly good student performance. We provide an interpretation for this phenomenon by examining the angles between teacher layers viewed from the student's perspective.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical time series has been playing a vital role in real-world healthcare systems as valuable information in monitoring health conditions of patients. Accurate classification for medical time series, e.g., Electrocardiography (ECG) signals, can help for early detection and diagnosis. Traditional methods towards medical time series classification rely on handcrafted feature extraction and statistical methods; with the recent advancement of artificial intelligence, the machine learning and deep learning methods have become more popular. However, existing methods often fail to fully model the complex spatial dynamics under different scales, which ignore the dynamic multi-resolution spatial and temporal joint inter-dependencies. Moreover, they are less likely to consider the special baseline wander problem as well as the multi-view characteristics of medical time series, which largely hinders their prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning framework, MedGNN, for medical time series classification. Specifically, we first propose to construct multi-resolution adaptive graph structures to learn dynamic multi-scale embeddings. Then, to address the baseline wander problem, we propose Difference Attention Networks to operate self-attention mechanisms on the finite difference for temporal modeling. Moreover, to learn the multi-view characteristics, we utilize the Frequency Convolution Networks to capture complementary information of medical time series from the frequency domain. In addition, we introduce the Multi-resolution Graph Transformer architecture to model the dynamic dependencies and fuse the information from different resolutions. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple medical real-world datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Our Code is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has enabled remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, offering new possibilities for creative content generation. However, in the realm of symbolic music, generating controllable and expressive performance-level style transfers for complete musical works remains challenging due to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations.

<p>Abstract: Object placement in robotic tasks is inherently challenging due to the diversity of object geometries and placement configurations. To address this, we propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects in different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in simulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of success rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models trained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully performs placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with varying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high precision for fine placement.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to struggle with consistently generating truthful responses. While various representation intervention techniques have been proposed, these methods typically apply a universal representation correction vector to all input queries, limiting their effectiveness against diverse queries in practice. In this study, we introduce TruthFlow, a novel method that leverages the Flow Matching technique for query-specific truthful representation correction. Specifically, TruthFlow first uses a flow model to learn query-specific correction vectors that transition representations from hallucinated to truthful states. Then, during inference, the trained flow model generates these correction vectors to enhance the truthfulness of LLM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that TruthFlow significantly improves performance on open-ended generation tasks across various advanced LLMs evaluated on TruthfulQA. Moreover, the trained TruthFlow model exhibits strong transferability, performing effectively on other unseen hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold promise as generalist robotics solutions by translating visual and linguistic inputs into robot actions, yet they lack reliability due to their black-box nature and sensitivity to environmental changes. In contrast, cognitive architectures (CA) excel in symbolic reasoning and state monitoring but are constrained by rigid predefined execution. This work bridges these approaches by probing OpenVLA's hidden layers to uncover symbolic representations of object properties, relations, and action states, enabling integration with a CA for enhanced interpretability and robustness. Through experiments on LIBERO-spatial pick-and-place tasks, we analyze the encoding of symbolic states across different layers of OpenVLA's Llama backbone. Our probing results show consistently high accuracies (> 0.90) for both object and action states across most layers, though contrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe the expected pattern of object states being encoded earlier than action states. We demonstrate an integrated DIARC-OpenVLA system that leverages these symbolic representations for real-time state monitoring, laying the foundation for more interpretable and reliable robotic manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congjie He, Yeqi Huang, Pei Mu, Ziming Miao, Jilong Xue, Lingxiao Ma, Fan Yang, Luo Mai</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging AI accelerators increasingly adopt wafer-scale manufacturing technologies, integrating hundreds of thousands of AI cores in a mesh-based architecture with large distributed on-chip memory (tens of GB in total) and ultra-high on-chip memory bandwidth (tens of PB/s). However, current LLM inference systems, optimized for shared memory architectures like GPUs, fail to fully exploit these accelerators. We introduce WaferLLM, the first wafer-scale LLM inference system. WaferLLM is guided by a novel PLMR device model that captures the unique hardware characteristics of wafer-scale architectures. Leveraging this model, WaferLLM pioneers wafer-scale LLM parallelism, optimizing the utilization of hundreds of thousands of on-chip cores. It also introduces MeshGEMM and MeshGEMV, the first GEMM and GEMV implementations designed to scale effectively on wafer-scale accelerators. Evaluations show that WaferLLM achieves 200$\times$ better wafer-scale accelerator utilization than state-of-the-art systems. On a commodity wafer-scale accelerator, WaferLLM delivers 606$\times$ faster and 22$\times$ more energy-efficient GEMV compared to an advanced GPU. For LLMs, WaferLLM enables 39$\times$ faster decoding with 1.7$\times$ better energy efficiency. We anticipate these numbers will grow significantly as wafer-scale AI models, software, and hardware continue to mature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulun Wu, Doron L. Bergman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to perform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without pre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior deep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework matches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without filtering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of missing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On common benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show that adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN. In addition, we demonstrate that our mixture block neural design has improved generalizability and greatly accelerated pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taejong Joo, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, adapting to new tasks by simply conditioning on demonstrations without parameter updates. Compelling empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that ICL, as a general-purpose learner, could outperform task-specific models. However, it remains unclear to what extent the transformers optimally learn in-context compared to principled learning algorithms. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new framework for quantifying optimality of ICL as a learning algorithm in stylized settings. Our findings reveal a striking dichotomy: while ICL initially matches the efficiency of a Bayes optimal estimator, its efficiency significantly deteriorates in long context. Through an information-theoretic analysis, we show that the diminishing efficiency is inherent to ICL. These results clarify the trade-offs in adopting ICL as a universal problem solver, motivating a new generation of on-the-fly adaptive methods without the diminishing efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piero Deidda, Kaicheng Zhang, Desmond Higham, Francesco Tudisco</p>
<p>Abstract: Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to oversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict conditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support for this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature representations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation functions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of oversmoothing without assumptions on the boundedness of the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in the rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhang, Wenbo Yang, Jun Wang, Qiang Ma, Jie Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Reza Rezaei, Adji Bousso Dieng</p>
<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runjin Chen, Gabriel Jacob Perin, Xuxi Chen, Xilun Chen, Yan Han, Nina S. T. Hirata, Junyuan Hong, Bhavya Kailkhura</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences, often achieved through fine-tuning based on human feedback, is essential for ensuring safe and responsible AI behaviors. However, the process typically requires substantial data and computation resources. Recent studies have revealed that alignment might be attainable at lower costs through simpler methods, such as in-context learning. This leads to the question: Is alignment predominantly superficial? In this paper, we delve into this question and provide a quantitative analysis. We formalize the concept of superficial knowledge, defining it as knowledge that can be acquired through easily token restyling, without affecting the model's ability to capture underlying causal relationships between tokens. We propose a method to extract and isolate superficial knowledge from aligned models, focusing on the shallow modifications to the final token selection process. By comparing models augmented only with superficial knowledge to fully aligned models, we quantify the superficial portion of alignment. Our findings reveal that while superficial knowledge constitutes a significant portion of alignment, particularly in safety and detoxification tasks, it is not the whole story. Tasks requiring reasoning and contextual understanding still rely on deeper knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate two practical advantages of isolated superficial knowledge: (1) it can be transferred between models, enabling efficient offsite alignment of larger models using extracted superficial knowledge from smaller models, and (2) it is recoverable, allowing for the restoration of alignment in compromised models without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akila Niroshan, Suranga Seneviratne, Aruna Seneviratne</p>
<p>Abstract: The Android ecosystem is vulnerable to issues such as app repackaging, counterfeiting, and piracy, threatening both developers and users. To mitigate these risks, developers often employ code obfuscation techniques. However, while effective in protecting legitimate applications, obfuscation also hinders security investigations as it is often exploited for malicious purposes. As such, it is important to understand code obfuscation practices in Android apps. In this paper, we analyze over 500,000 Android APKs from Google Play, spanning an eight-year period, to investigate the evolution and prevalence of code obfuscation techniques. First, we propose a set of classifiers to detect obfuscated code, tools, and techniques and then conduct a longitudinal analysis to identify trends. Our results show a 13% increase in obfuscation from 2016 to 2023, with ProGuard and Allatori as the most commonly used tools. We also show that obfuscation is more prevalent in top-ranked apps and gaming genres such as Casino apps. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of obfuscation adoption in the Google Play Store, providing insights for developers and security analysts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Li, Yingjing Huang, Gengchen Mai, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Street view imagery is extensively utilized in representation learning for urban visual environments, supporting various sustainable development tasks such as environmental perception and socio-economic assessment. However, it is challenging for existing image representations to specifically encode the dynamic urban environment (such as pedestrians, vehicles, and vegetation), the built environment (including buildings, roads, and urban infrastructure), and the environmental ambiance (such as the cultural and socioeconomic atmosphere) depicted in street view imagery to address downstream tasks related to the city. In this work, we propose an innovative self-supervised learning framework that leverages temporal and spatial attributes of street view imagery to learn image representations of the dynamic urban environment for diverse downstream tasks. By employing street view images captured at the same location over time and spatially nearby views at the same time, we construct contrastive learning tasks designed to learn the temporal-invariant characteristics of the built environment and the spatial-invariant neighborhood ambiance. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised and unsupervised methods in tasks such as visual place recognition, socioeconomic estimation, and human-environment perception. Moreover, we demonstrate the varying behaviors of image representations learned through different contrastive learning objectives across various downstream tasks. This study systematically discusses representation learning strategies for urban studies based on street view images, providing a benchmark that enhances the applicability of visual data in urban science.

<p>Abstract: Neural Ranking Models (NRMs) have rapidly advanced state-of-the-art performance on information retrieval tasks. In this work, we investigate a Cross-Encoder variant of MiniLM to determine which relevance features it computes and where they are stored. We find that it employs a semantic variant of the traditional BM25 in an interpretable manner, featuring localized components: (1) Transformer attention heads that compute soft term frequency while controlling for term saturation and document length effects, and (2) a low-rank component of its embedding matrix that encodes inverse document frequency information for the vocabulary. This suggests that the Cross-Encoder uses the same fundamental mechanisms as BM25, but further leverages their capacity to capture semantics for improved retrieval performance. The granular understanding lays the groundwork for model editing to enhance model transparency, addressing safety concerns, and improving scalability in training and real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heasung Kim, Taekyun Lee, Hyeji Kim, Gustavo de Veciana</p>
<p>Abstract: Importance sampling, which involves sampling from a probability density function (PDF) proportional to the product of an importance weight function and a base PDF, is a powerful technique with applications in variance reduction, biased or customized sampling, data augmentation, and beyond. Inspired by the growing availability of score-based generative models (SGMs), we propose an entirely training-free Importance sampling framework that relies solely on an SGM for the base PDF. Our key innovation is realizing the importance sampling process as a backward diffusion process, expressed in terms of the score function of the base PDF and the specified importance weight function--both readily available--eliminating the need for any additional training. We conduct a thorough analysis demonstrating the method's scalability and effectiveness across diverse datasets and tasks, including importance sampling for industrial and natural images with neural importance weight functions. The training-free aspect of our method is particularly compelling in real-world scenarios where a single base distribution underlies multiple biased sampling tasks, each requiring a different importance weight function. To the best of our knowledge our approach is the first importance sampling framework to achieve this.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of human and artificial intelligence represents a scientific opportunity to advance our understanding of information processing, as each system offers unique computational insights that can enhance and inform the other. The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Yao, Ruifeng Ren, Yun Liao, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations has become a widely adopted strategy due to its significant enhancement of reasoning capabilities. To fully comprehend this approach, two questions naturally arise: (Q1) What advantages does training with CoT offer compared to training without CoT? (Q2) If there are advantages, what are the underlying mechanisms of explicit CoT training? Analyzing the advantages and mechanisms of CoT training is challenging due to the many factors involved. To address this, we conduct a detailed analysis using clear and controllable data distributions and, for the first time, reveal that CoT training offers the following advantages: (1) Training with CoT markedly improves reasoning generalization, extending it from in-distribution (ID) to both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, while also speeding up convergence; (2) Even when training with CoT includes a certain range of erroneous reasoning steps, it still enables the model to learn reasoning patterns, leading to systematic generalization. We further explore the underlying mechanisms from a circuit perspective: (1) The data distribution (e.g., ratio $\lambda$ and pattern) plays a crucial role in influencing the model's systematic generalization; (2) CoT training (with two-hop facts) internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying explicit CoT training and offer critical insights into tuning strategies for LLMs to achieve robust generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks, producing high-quality outputs across diverse domains. However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective linguistic choices that attract potential customers play crucial roles in advertising success. This study aims to explore the linguistic features of ad texts that influence human preferences. Although the creation of attractive ad texts is an active area of research, progress in understanding the specific linguistic features that affect attractiveness is hindered by several obstacles. First, human preferences are complex and influenced by multiple factors, including their content, such as brand names, and their linguistic styles, making analysis challenging. Second, publicly available ad text datasets that include human preferences are lacking, such as ad performance metrics and human feedback, which reflect people's interests. To address these problems, we present AdParaphrase, a paraphrase dataset that contains human preferences for pairs of ad texts that are semantically equivalent but differ in terms of wording and style. This dataset allows for preference analysis that focuses on the differences in linguistic features. Our analysis revealed that ad texts preferred by human judges have higher fluency, longer length, more nouns, and use of bracket symbols. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an ad text-generation model that considers these findings significantly improves the attractiveness of a given text. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/AdParaphrase.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discovering the genotype-phenotype relationship is crucial for genetic engineering, which will facilitate advances in fields such as crop breeding, conservation biology, and personalized medicine. Current research usually focuses on single species and small datasets due to limitations in phenotypic data collection, especially for traits that require visual assessments or physical measurements. Deciphering complex and composite phenotypes, such as morphology, from genetic data at scale remains an open question. To break through traditional generic models that rely on simplified assumptions, this paper introduces G2PDiffusion, the first-of-its-kind diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype generation across multiple species. Specifically, we use images to represent morphological phenotypes across species and redefine phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. To this end, this paper introduces an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and trains a stable diffusion model with a novel alignment method to improve genotype-to-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances phenotype prediction accuracy across species, capturing subtle genetic variations that contribute to observable traits.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction following is a core capability of modern Large language models (LLMs), making evaluating this capability essential to understanding these models. The Instruction Following Evaluation (IFEval) benchmark from the literature does this using objective criteria, offering a measure of LLM performance without subjective AI or human judgement. However, it only includes English instructions, limiting its ability to assess LLMs in other languages.
  We propose the Multilingual Instruction Following Evaluation (M-IFEval) benchmark, expanding the evaluation to French, Japanese, and Spanish, with both general and language-specific instructions. Applying this benchmark to 8 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that benchmark performance across languages and instruction types can vary widely, underscoring the importance of a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs in a diverse cultural context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance on challenging benchmarks that are often structured as multiple-choice question-answering (QA) tasks. Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in LLMs but provides only vague and generic guidance ("think step by step"). This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive and effective zero-shot prompting method that explicitly incorporates three key steps in QA solving: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Comprehensive experiments across diverse and challenging QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently improves the Baseline (without ARR prompting) and outperforms CoT. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each component: analyzing, retrieving, and reasoning. Notably, intent analysis plays a vital role in ARR. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of the subspace - eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications, personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models (DMs) in data generation, they exhibit specific failure cases with unsatisfactory outputs. We focus on one such limitation: the ability of DMs to learn hidden rules between image features. Specifically, for image data with dependent features ($\mathbf{x}$) and ($\mathbf{y}$) (e.g., the height of the sun ($\mathbf{x}$) and the length of the shadow ($\mathbf{y}$)), we investigate whether DMs can accurately capture the inter-feature rule ($p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$). Empirical evaluations on mainstream DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3.5) reveal consistent failures, such as inconsistent lighting-shadow relationships and mismatched object-mirror reflections. Inspired by these findings, we design four synthetic tasks with strongly correlated features to assess DMs' rule-learning abilities. Extensive experiments show that while DMs can identify coarse-grained rules, they struggle with fine-grained ones. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that DMs trained via denoising score matching (DSM) exhibit constant errors in learning hidden rules, as the DSM objective is not compatible with rule conformity. To mitigate this, we introduce a common technique - incorporating additional classifier guidance during sampling, which achieves (limited) improvements. Our analysis reveals that the subtle signals of fine-grained rules are challenging for the classifier to capture, providing insights for future exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) has shed light on software agent -- where software can understand and follow user instructions in natural language. However, existing approaches such as API-based and GUI-based agents are far from satisfactory at accuracy and efficiency aspects. Instead, we advocate to endow LLMs with access to the software internals (source code and runtime context) and the permission to dynamically inject generated code into software for execution. In such a whitebox setting, one may better leverage the software context and the coding ability of LLMs. We then present an overall design architecture and case studies on two popular web-based desktop applications. We also give in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions. We deem that such a new paradigm has the potential to fundamentally overturn the existing software agent design, and finally creating a digital world in which software can comprehend, operate, collaborate, and even think to meet complex user needs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phishing has long been a common tactic used by cybercriminals and continues to pose a significant threat in today's digital world. When phishing attacks become more advanced and sophisticated, there is an increasing need for effective methods to detect and prevent them. To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing emails, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in detecting phishing emails.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Feng, Yunlong Li, Yuanzhe Gao, Alberto Huertas Celdr\'an, Jan von der Assen, G\'er\^ome Bovet, Burkhard Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant attention as a prominent privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) paradigm. Decentralized FL (DFL) eschews traditional FL's centralized server architecture, enhancing the system's robustness and scalability. However, these advantages of DFL also create new vulnerabilities for malicious participants to execute adversarial attacks, especially model poisoning attacks. In model poisoning attacks, malicious participants aim to diminish the performance of benign models by creating and disseminating the compromised model. Existing research on model poisoning attacks has predominantly concentrated on undermining global models within the Centralized FL (CFL) paradigm, while there needs to be more research in DFL. To fill the research gap, this paper proposes an innovative model poisoning attack called DMPA. This attack calculates the differential characteristics of multiple malicious client models and obtains the most effective poisoning strategy, thereby orchestrating a collusive attack by multiple participants. The effectiveness of this attack is validated across multiple datasets, with results indicating that the DMPA approach consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art FL model poisoning attack strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Xiao Gao, Chenyang Wu, Mingjun Cao, Chenjun Xiao, Yang Yu, Zongzhang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary focus of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to manage the risk of hazardous exploitation of out-of-distribution actions. An effective approach to achieve this goal is through behavior regularization, which augments conventional RL objectives by incorporating constraints that enforce the policy to remain close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naga Sai Dasari, Atta Badii, Armin Moin, Ahmed Ashlam</p>
<p>Abstract: SQL Injection (SQLi) continues to pose a significant threat to the security of web applications, enabling attackers to manipulate databases and access sensitive information without authorisation. Although advancements have been made in detection techniques, traditional signature-based methods still struggle to identify sophisticated SQL injection attacks that evade predefined patterns. As SQLi attacks evolve, the need for more adaptive detection systems becomes crucial. This paper introduces an innovative approach that leverages generative models to enhance SQLi detection and prevention mechanisms. By incorporating Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Conditional Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP), and U-Net, synthetic SQL queries were generated to augment training datasets for machine learning models. The proposed method demonstrated improved accuracy in SQLi detection systems by reducing both false positives and false negatives. Extensive empirical testing further illustrated the ability of the system to adapt to evolving SQLi attack patterns, resulting in enhanced precision and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Zeng, Weizhe Huang, Lei Jiang, Tongxuan Liu, Xitai Jin, Chen Tianying Tiana, Jing Li, Xiaohua Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) scenarios, but they still face challenges when handling complex arithmetic and logical reasoning tasks. While Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, self-consistency (SC) and self-correction strategies have attempted to guide models in sequential, multi-step reasoning, Multi-agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a viable approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By increasing both the number of agents and the frequency of debates, the performance of LLMs improves significantly. However, this strategy results in a significant increase in token costs, presenting a barrier to scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel sparsification strategy designed to reduce token costs within MAD. This approach minimizes ineffective exchanges of information and unproductive discussions among agents, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the debate process. We conduct comparative experiments on multiple datasets across various models, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces the token costs in MAD to a considerable extent. Specifically, compared to MAD, our approach achieves an impressive reduction of up to 94.5\% in token costs while maintaining performance degradation below 2.0\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fever of unknown origin FUO remains a diagnostic challenge. MedMimic is introduced as a multimodal framework inspired by real-world diagnostic processes. It uses pretrained models such as DINOv2, Vision Transformer, and ResNet-18 to convert high-dimensional 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging into low-dimensional, semantically meaningful features. A learnable self-attention-based fusion network then integrates these imaging features with clinical data for classification. Using 416 FUO patient cases from Sichuan University West China Hospital from 2017 to 2023, the multimodal fusion classification network MFCN achieved macro-AUROC scores ranging from 0.8654 to 0.9291 across seven tasks, outperforming conventional machine learning and single-modality deep learning methods. Ablation studies and five-fold cross-validation further validated its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of pretrained large models and deep learning, MedMimic offers a promising solution for disease classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedidya Kfir, Elad Sarafian, Sarit Kraus, Yoram Louzoun</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box algorithms are designed to optimize functions without relying on their underlying analytical structure or gradient information, making them essential when gradients are inaccessible or difficult to compute. Traditional methods for solving black-box optimization (BBO) problems predominantly rely on non-parametric models and struggle to scale to large input spaces. Conversely, parametric methods that model the function with neural estimators and obtain gradient signals via backpropagation may suffer from significant gradient errors. A recent alternative, Explicit Gradient Learning (EGL), which directly learns the gradient using a first-order Taylor approximation, has demonstrated superior performance over both parametric and non-parametric methods. In this work, we propose two novel gradient learning variants to address the robustness challenges posed by high-dimensional, complex, and highly non-linear problems. Optimistic Gradient Learning (OGL) introduces a bias toward lower regions in the function landscape, while Higher-order Gradient Learning (HGL) incorporates second-order Taylor corrections to improve gradient accuracy. We combine these approaches into the unified OHGL algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the synthetic COCO suite. Additionally, we demonstrate OHGLs applicability to high-dimensional real-world machine learning (ML) tasks such as adversarial training and code generation. Our results highlight OHGLs ability to generate stronger candidates, offering a valuable tool for ML researchers and practitioners tackling high-dimensional, non-linear optimization challenges</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), which decodes spoken words from video data, offers significant benefits, particularly when audio is unavailable. However, the high dimensionality of video data leads to prohibitive computational costs that demand powerful hardware, limiting VSR deployment on resource-constrained devices. This work addresses this limitation by developing lightweight VSR architectures. Leveraging efficient operation design paradigms, we create compact yet powerful models with reduced resource requirements and minimal accuracy loss. We train and evaluate our models on a large-scale public dataset for recognition of words from video sequences, demonstrating their effectiveness for practical applications. We also conduct an extensive array of ablative experiments to thoroughly analyze the size and complexity of each model. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04864">$TAR^2$: Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution for Optimal Policy Preservation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Kapoor, Kale-ab Tessera, Mayank Baranwal, Harshad Khadilkar, Stefano Albrecht, Mingfei Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), learning effective policies is challenging when global rewards are sparse and delayed. This difficulty arises from the need to assign credit across both agents and time steps, a problem that existing methods often fail to address in episodic, long-horizon tasks. We propose Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution $TAR^2$, a novel approach that decomposes sparse global rewards into agent-specific, time-step-specific components, thereby providing more frequent and accurate feedback for policy learning. Theoretically, we show that $TAR^2$ (i) aligns with potential-based reward shaping, preserving the same optimal policies as the original environment, and (ii) maintains policy gradient update directions identical to those under the original sparse reward, ensuring unbiased credit signals. Empirical results on two challenging benchmarks, SMACLite and Google Research Football, demonstrate that $TAR^2$ significantly stabilizes and accelerates convergence, outperforming strong baselines like AREL and STAS in both learning speed and final performance. These findings establish $TAR^2$ as a principled and practical solution for agent-temporal credit assignment in sparse-reward multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Leask, Bart Bussmann, Michael Pearce, Joseph Bloom, Curt Tigges, Noura Al Moubayed, Lee Sharkey, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: A common goal of mechanistic interpretability is to decompose the activations of neural networks into features: interpretable properties of the input computed by the model. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for finding these features in LLMs, and it has been postulated that they can be used to find a \textit{canonical} set of units: a unique and complete list of atomic features. We cast doubt on this belief using two novel techniques: SAE stitching to show they are incomplete, and meta-SAEs to show they are not atomic. SAE stitching involves inserting or swapping latents from a larger SAE into a smaller one. Latents from the larger SAE can be divided into two categories: \emph{novel latents}, which improve performance when added to the smaller SAE, indicating they capture novel information, and \emph{reconstruction latents}, which can replace corresponding latents in the smaller SAE that have similar behavior. The existence of novel features indicates incompleteness of smaller SAEs. Using meta-SAEs -- SAEs trained on the decoder matrix of another SAE -- we find that latents in SAEs often decompose into combinations of latents from a smaller SAE, showing that larger SAE latents are not atomic. The resulting decompositions are often interpretable; e.g. a latent representing ``Einstein'' decomposes into ``scientist'', ``Germany'', and ``famous person''. Even if SAEs do not find canonical units of analysis, they may still be useful tools. We suggest that future research should either pursue different approaches for identifying such units, or pragmatically choose the SAE size suited to their task. We provide an interactive dashboard to explore meta-SAEs: https://metasaes.streamlit.app/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Coimbra Brioso, Leonardo Crespi, Andrea Seghetto, Damiano Dei, Nicola Lambri, Pietro Mancosu, Marta Scorsetti, Daniele Loiacono</p>
<p>Abstract: A key step in Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) workflows is the evaluation of the patient's anatomy at treatment time to ensure the accuracy of the delivery. To this end, Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) is widely used being cost-effective and easy to integrate into the treatment process. Nonetheless, CBCT images have lower resolution and more artifacts than CT scans, making them less reliable for precise treatment validation. Moreover, in complex treatments such as Total Marrow and Lymph Node Irradiation (TMLI), where full-body visualization of the patient is critical for accurate dose delivery, the CBCT images are often discontinuous, leaving gaps that could contain relevant anatomical information. To address these limitations, we propose ARTInp (Adaptive Radiation Therapy Inpainting), a novel deep-learning framework combining image inpainting and CBCT-to-CT translation. ARTInp employs a dual-network approach: a completion network that fills anatomical gaps in CBCT volumes and a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate high-quality synthetic CT (sCT) images. We trained ARTInp on a dataset of paired CBCT and CT images from the SynthRad 2023 challenge, and the performance achieved on a test set of 18 patients demonstrates its potential for enhancing CBCT-based workflows in radiotherapy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of digital interactions across diverse domains, such as healthcare, e-commerce, gaming, and finance, has resulted in the generation of vast volumes of event stream (ES) data. ES data comprises continuous sequences of timestamped events that encapsulate detailed contextual information relevant to each domain. While ES data holds significant potential for extracting actionable insights and enhancing decision-making, its effective utilization is hindered by challenges such as the scarcity of labeled data and the fragmented nature of existing research efforts. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by enabling the extraction of meaningful representations from unlabeled ES data. In this survey, we systematically review and synthesize SSL methodologies tailored for ES modeling across multiple domains, bridging the gaps between domain-specific approaches that have traditionally operated in isolation. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of SSL techniques, encompassing both predictive and contrastive paradigms, and analyze their applicability and effectiveness within different application contexts. Furthermore, we identify critical gaps in current research and propose a future research agenda aimed at developing scalable, domain-agnostic SSL frameworks for ES modeling. By unifying disparate research efforts and highlighting cross-domain synergies, this survey aims to accelerate innovation, improve reproducibility, and expand the applicability of SSL to diverse real-world ES challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pansharpening aims to combine a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to produce a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. Although pansharpening in the frequency domain offers clear advantages, most existing methods either continue to operate solely in the spatial domain or fail to fully exploit the benefits of the frequency domain. To address this issue, we innovatively propose Multi-Frequency Fusion Attention (MFFA), which leverages wavelet transforms to cleanly separate frequencies and enable lossless reconstruction across different frequency domains. Then, we generate Frequency-Query, Spatial-Key, and Fusion-Value based on the physical meanings represented by different features, which enables a more effective capture of specific information in the frequency domain. Additionally, we focus on the preservation of frequency features across different operations. On a broader level, our network employs a wavelet pyramid to progressively fuse information across multiple scales. Compared to previous frequency domain approaches, our network better prevents confusion and loss of different frequency features during the fusion process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches and shows significant generalization capabilities for real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiandong Zou, Mingzhu Shen, Christos-Savvas Bouganis, Yiren Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted technique in text-to-image models, enabling precise rendering of multiple distinct elements, such as characters and styles, in multi-concept image generation. However, current approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for multi-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image quality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the denoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on the hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to "semantic conflicts", we find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and textures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the overall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we devise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal order in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy offers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive integration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully leverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA composition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached Multi-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while maintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for multi-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual LoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA composition and improve computational efficiency. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art training-free LoRA fusion methods by a significant margin -- it achieves an average improvement of $2.19\%$ in CLIPScore, and $11.25\%$ in MLLM win rate compared to LoraHub, LoRA Composite, and LoRA Switch.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of renewable energy into electricity markets poses significant challenges to price stability and increases the complexity of market operations. Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting is crucial for effective market participation, where price dynamics can be significantly more challenging to predict. Probabilistic forecasting, through prediction intervals, efficiently quantifies the inherent uncertainties in electricity prices, supporting better decision-making for market participants. This study explores the enhancement of probabilistic price prediction using Conformal Prediction (CP) techniques, specifically Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals and Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference. These methods provide precise and reliable prediction intervals, outperforming traditional models in validity metrics. We propose an ensemble approach that combines the efficiency of quantile regression models with the robust coverage properties of time series adapted CP techniques. This ensemble delivers both narrow prediction intervals and high coverage, leading to more reliable and accurate forecasts. We further evaluate the practical implications of CP techniques through a simulated trading algorithm applied to a battery storage system. The ensemble approach demonstrates improved financial returns in energy trading in both the Day-Ahead and Balancing Markets, highlighting its practical benefits for market participants.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development and operation of smart cities relyheavily on large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks and sensor infrastructures that continuously monitor various aspects of urban environments. These networks generate vast amounts of data, posing challenges related to bandwidth usage, energy consumption, and system scalability. This paper introduces a novel sensing paradigm called Data-driven Modality Fusion (DMF), designed to enhance the efficiency of smart city IoT network management. By leveraging correlations between timeseries data from different sensing modalities, the proposed DMF approach reduces the number of physical sensors required for monitoring, thereby minimizing energy expenditure, communication bandwidth, and overall deployment costs. The framework relocates computational complexity from the edge devices to the core, ensuring that resource-constrained IoT devices are not burdened with intensive processing tasks. DMF is validated using data from a real-world IoT deployment in Madrid, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately estimating traffic, environmental, and pollution metrics from a reduced set of sensors. The proposed solution offers a scalable, efficient mechanism for managing urban IoT networks, while addressing issues of sensor failure and privacy concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeren Luo, Zifan Peng, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Mingchen Li, Jingyi Zheng, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs), offering precise and efficient responses by integrating external databases with pre-existing knowledge. However, we observe that these AIPSEs raise risks such as quoting malicious content or citing malicious websites, leading to harmful or unverified information dissemination. In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk level, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly query URL will increase the risk level while query with natural language will mitigate such risk. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4o-based content refinement tool and an XGBoost-based URL detector. Our evaluation shows that our defense can effectively reduce the risk but with the cost of reducing available information. Our research highlights the urgent need for robust safety measures in AIPSEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianshu Zhang, Xiaofu Wu, Junquan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the anti-jamming channel access problem in complex and unknown jamming environments, where the jammer could dynamically adjust its strategies to target different channels. Traditional channel hopping anti-jamming approaches using fixed patterns are ineffective against such dynamic jamming attacks. Although the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel access approach could achieve the Nash equilibrium under fast-changing jamming attacks, it requires extensive training episodes. To address this issue, we propose a fast adaptive anti-jamming channel access approach guided by the intuition of ``learning faster than the jammer", where a synchronously updated coarse-grained spectrum prediction serves as an auxiliary task for the deep Q learning (DQN) based anti-jamming model. This helps the model identify a superior Q-function compared to standard DRL while significantly reducing the number of training episodes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the rate of convergence in model training, reducing the required training episodes by up to 70% compared to standard DRL. Additionally, it also achieves a 10% improvement in throughput over NE strategies, owing to the effective use of coarse-grained spectrum prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerrit J. J. van den Burg, Gen Suzuki, Wei Liu, Murat Sensoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated judges to evaluate recommendation systems, search engines, and other subjective tasks, where relying on human evaluators can be costly, time-consuming, and unscalable. LLMs offer an efficient solution for continuous, automated evaluation. However, since the systems that are built and improved with these judgments are ultimately designed for human use, it is crucial that LLM judgments align closely with human evaluators to ensure such systems remain human-centered. On the other hand, aligning LLM judgments with human evaluators is challenging due to individual variability and biases in human judgments. We propose a simple yet effective framework to align LLM judgments with individual human evaluators or their aggregated judgments, without retraining or fine-tuning the LLM. Our approach learns a linear mapping between the LLM's outputs and human judgments, achieving over 142% average improvement in agreement across 29 tasks with only a small number of calibration examples used for training. Notably, our method works in zero-shot and few-shot settings, exceeds inter-human agreement on four out of six tasks, and enables smaller LLMs to achieve performance comparable to that of larger models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Luo, Qingyun Sun, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial evasion attacks pose significant threats to graph learning, with lines of studies that have improved the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking strategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph learning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we investigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification framework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model to learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed structures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured predictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the forward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which structure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during the forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism to selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment between the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse process, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer entropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiyi Wang, Liang Liang, Guang Yang, Thomas Heinis, Eiko Yoneki</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Index Structures (LIS) have significantly advanced data management by leveraging machine learning models to optimize data indexing. However, designing these structures often involves critical trade-offs, making it challenging for both designers and end-users to find an optimal balance tailored to specific workloads and scenarios. While some indexes offer adjustable parameters that demand intensive manual tuning, others rely on fixed configurations based on heuristic auto-tuners or expert knowledge, which may not consistently deliver optimal performance.
  This paper introduces LITune, a novel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures. LITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To accommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance LITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These innovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online tuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and workloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in runtime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter settings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight LITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua C. Yang, Fynn Bachmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Democratic processes increasingly aim to integrate large-scale voting with face-to-face deliberation, addressing the challenge of reconciling individual preferences with collective decision-making. This work introduces new methods that use algorithms and computational tools to bridge online voting with face-to-face deliberation, tested in two real-world scenarios: Kultur Komitee 2024 (KK24) and vTaiwan. These case studies highlight the practical applications and impacts of the proposed methods.
  We present three key contributions: (1) Radial Clustering for Preference Based Subgroups, which enables both in-depth and broad discussions in deliberative settings by computing homogeneous and heterogeneous group compositions with balanced and adjustable group sizes; (2) Human-in-the-loop MES, a practical method that enhances the Method of Equal Shares (MES) algorithm with real-time digital feedback. This builds algorithmic trust by giving participants full control over how much decision-making is delegated to the voting aggregation algorithm as compared to deliberation; and (3) the ReadTheRoom deliberation method, which uses opinion space mapping to identify agreement and divergence, along with spectrum-based preference visualisation to track opinion shifts during deliberation. This approach enhances transparency by clarifying collective sentiment and fosters collaboration by encouraging participants to engage constructively with differing perspectives.
  By introducing these actionable frameworks, this research extends in-person deliberation with scalable digital methods that address the complexities of modern decision-making in participatory processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yohannis Kifle Telila, Damitha Senevirathne, Dumindu Tissera, Apurva Narayan, Miriam A. M. Capretz, Katarina Grolinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in the energy sector to identify irregular patterns indicating equipment failures, energy theft, or other issues. Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are typically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which raises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data. However, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions. While adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain largely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain. Moreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly unknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in energy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in an FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data. The results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks, attributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10% even with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gawoon Ban, Hyeongjun Kim, Seokjun Choi, Seungwoo Yoon, Seung-Hwan Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Display photometric stereo uses a display as a programmable light source to illuminate a scene with diverse illumination conditions. Recently, differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) demonstrated improved normal reconstruction accuracy by using learned display patterns. However, DDPS faced limitations in practicality, requiring a fixed desktop imaging setup using a polarization camera and a desktop-scale monitor. In this paper, we propose a more practical physics-based photometric stereo, differentiable mobile display photometric stereo (DMDPS), that leverages a mobile phone consisting of a display and a camera. We overcome the limitations of using a mobile device by developing a mobile app and method that simultaneously displays patterns and captures high-quality HDR images. Using this technique, we capture real-world 3D-printed objects and learn display patterns via a differentiable learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMDPS on both a 3D printed dataset and a first dataset of fallen leaves. The leaf dataset contains reconstructed surface normals and albedos of fallen leaves that may enable future research beyond computer graphics and vision. We believe that DMDPS takes a step forward for practical physics-based photometric stereo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgina Nouli, Axel Parmentier, Maximilian Schiffer</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowdsourced on-demand services offer benefits such as reduced costs, faster service fulfillment times, greater adaptability, and contributions to sustainable urban transportation in on-demand delivery contexts. However, the success of an on-demand platform that utilizes crowdsourcing relies on finding a compensation policy that strikes a balance between creating attractive offers for gig workers and ensuring profitability. In this work, we examine a dynamic pricing problem for an on-demand platform that sets request-specific compensation of gig workers in a discrete-time framework, where requests and workers arrive stochastically. The operator's goal is to determine a compensation policy that maximizes the total expected reward over the time horizon. Our approach introduces compensation strategies that explicitly account for gig worker request preferences. To achieve this, we employ the Multinomial Logit model to represent the acceptance probabilities of gig workers, and, as a result, derive an analytical solution that utilizes post-decision states. Subsequently, we integrate this solution into an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We compare our algorithm against benchmark algorithms, including formula-based policies and an upper bound provided by the full information linear programming solution. Our algorithm demonstrates consistent performance across diverse settings, achieving improvements of at least 2.5-7.5% in homogeneous gig worker populations and 9% in heterogeneous populations over benchmarks, based on fully synthetic data. For real-world data, it surpasses benchmarks by 8% in weak and 20% in strong location preference scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The astonishing performance of large language models (LLMs) and their remarkable achievements in production and daily life have led to their widespread application in collaborative tasks. However, current large models face challenges such as hallucination and lack of specificity in content generation in vertical domain tasks. Inspired by the contrast and classification mechanisms in human cognitive processes, this paper constructs an adversarial learning-based prompt framework named ChallengeMe, which includes three cascaded solutions: generation prompts, evaluation prompts, and feedback optimization. In this process, we designed seven core optimization dimensions and set the threshold for adversarial learning. The results of mixed case studies on the text summarization task show that the proposed framework can generate more accurate and fluent text summaries compared to the current advanced mainstream LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Leeb, Zhijing Jin, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective and reliable evaluation is essential for advancing empirical machine learning. However, the increasing accessibility of generalist models and the progress towards ever more complex, high-level tasks make systematic evaluation more challenging. Benchmarks are plagued by various biases, artifacts, or leakage, while models may behave unreliably due to poorly explored failure modes. Haphazard treatments and inconsistent formulations of such "monsters" can contribute to a duplication of efforts, a lack of trust in results, and unsupported inferences. In this position paper, we argue causality offers an ideal framework to systematically address these challenges. By making causal assumptions in an approach explicit, we can faithfully model phenomena, formulate testable hypotheses with explanatory power, and leverage principled tools for analysis. To make causal model design more accessible, we identify several useful Common Abstract Topologies (CATs) in causal graphs which help gain insight into the reasoning abilities in large language models. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how the precise yet pragmatic language of causality clarifies the strengths and limitations of a method and inspires new approaches for systematic progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thierry Bossy, Julien Vignoud, Tahseen Rabbani, Juan R. Troncoso Pastoriza, Martin Jaggi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative training which avoids direct data exposure between clients. However, data privacy issues still remain: FL-trained large language models are capable of memorizing and completing phrases and sentences contained in training data when given with their prefixes. Thus, it is possible for adversarial and honest-but-curious clients to recover training data of other participants simply through targeted prompting. In this work, we demonstrate that a popular and simple fine-tuning strategy, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), reduces memorization during FL up to a factor of 10. We study this effect by performing a medical question-answering fine-tuning task and injecting multiple replicas of out-of-distribution sensitive sequences drawn from an external clinical dataset. We observe a reduction in memorization for a wide variety of Llama 2 and 3 models, and find that LoRA can reduce memorization in centralized learning as well. Furthermore, we show that LoRA can be combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as gradient clipping and Gaussian noising, secure aggregation, and Goldfish loss to further improve record-level privacy while maintaining performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding time from visual representations is a fundamental cognitive skill, yet it remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Zheng, Shuo Yang, Edith C. H. Ngai, Suman Jana, Lorenzo Cavallaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based Android malware detectors degrade over time due to natural distribution drift caused by malware variants and new families. This paper systematically investigates the challenges classifiers trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) face against such distribution shifts and attributes their shortcomings to their inability to learn stable discriminative features. Invariant learning theory offers a promising solution by encouraging models to generate stable representations crossing environments that expose the instability of the training set. However, the lack of prior environment labels, the diversity of drift factors, and low-quality representations caused by diverse families make this task challenging. To address these issues, we propose TIF, the first temporal invariant training framework for malware detection, which aims to enhance the ability of detectors to learn stable representations across time. TIF organizes environments based on application observation dates to reveal temporal drift, integrating specialized multi-proxy contrastive learning and invariant gradient alignment to generate and align environments with high-quality, stable representations. TIF can be seamlessly integrated into any learning-based detector. Experiments on a decade-long dataset show that TIF excels, particularly in early deployment stages, addressing real-world needs and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consumer energy forecasting is essential for managing energy consumption and planning, directly influencing operational efficiency, cost reduction, personalized energy management, and sustainability efforts. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially LSTMs and transformers, have been greatly successful in the field of energy consumption forecasting. Nevertheless, these techniques have difficulties in capturing complex and sudden variations, and, moreover, they are commonly examined only on a specific type of consumer (e.g., only offices, only schools). Consequently, this paper proposes HyperEnergy, a consumer energy forecasting strategy that leverages hypernetworks for improved modeling of complex patterns applicable across a diversity of consumers. Hypernetwork is responsible for predicting the parameters of the primary prediction network, in our case LSTM. A learnable adaptable kernel, comprised of polynomial and radial basis function kernels, is incorporated to enhance performance. The proposed HyperEnergy was evaluated on diverse consumers including, student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, and a townhouse. Across all consumer types, HyperEnergy consistently outperformed 10 other techniques, including state-of-the-art models such as LSTM, AttentionLSTM, and transformer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Applied ethics is ubiquitous in most domains, requiring much deliberation due to its philosophical nature. Varying views often lead to conflicting courses of action where ethical dilemmas become challenging to resolve. Although many factors contribute to such a decision, the major driving forces can be discretized and thus simplified to provide an indicative answer. Knowledge representation and reasoning offer a way to explicitly translate abstract ethical concepts into applicable principles within the context of an event. To achieve this, we propose ApplE, an Applied Ethics ontology that captures philosophical theory and event context to holistically describe the morality of an action. The development process adheres to a modified version of the Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD) and utilizes standard design and publication practices. Using ApplE, we model a use case from the bioethics domain that demonstrates our ontology's social and scientific value. Apart from the ontological reasoning and quality checks, ApplE is also evaluated using the three-fold testing process of SAMOD. ApplE follows FAIR principles and aims to be a viable resource for applied ethicists and ontology engineers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens used
  by a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Older adult patients constitute a rapidly growing subgroup of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. In these situations, their family caregivers are expected to represent the unconscious patients to access and interpret patients' medical information. However, caregivers currently have to rely on overloaded clinicians for information updates and typically lack the health literacy to understand complex medical information. Our project aims to explore the information needs of caregivers of ICU older adult patients, from which we can propose design opportunities to guide future AI systems. The project begins with formative interviews with 11 caregivers to identify their challenges in accessing and interpreting medical information; From these findings, we then synthesize design requirements and propose an AI system prototype to cope with caregivers' challenges. The system prototype has two key features: a timeline visualization to show the AI extracted and summarized older adult patients' key medical events; and an LLM-based chatbot to provide context-aware informational support. We conclude our paper by reporting on the follow-up user evaluation of the system and discussing future AI-based systems for ICU caregivers of older adults.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work on long-form audio generation using global-view diffusion or iterative generation demands significant training or inference costs. While recent advancements in multi-view joint diffusion for panoramic generation provide an efficient option, they struggle with spectrum generation with severe overlap distortions and high cross-view consistency costs. We initially explore this phenomenon through the connectivity inheritance of latent maps and uncover that averaging operations excessively smooth the high-frequency components of the latent map. To address these issues, we propose Swap Forward (SaFa), a frame-level latent swap framework that synchronizes multiple diffusions to produce a globally coherent long audio with more spectrum details in a forward-only manner. At its core, the bidirectional Self-Loop Latent Swap is applied between adjacent views, leveraging stepwise diffusion trajectory to adaptively enhance high-frequency components without disrupting low-frequency components. Furthermore, to ensure cross-view consistency, the unidirectional Reference-Guided Latent Swap is applied between the reference and the non-overlap regions of each subview during the early stages, providing centralized trajectory guidance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based long audio generation models. Moreover, we find that it also adapts well to panoramic generation, achieving comparable state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency and model generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengjian Kang, Ye Zhang, Xiaoyu Deng, Xintao Li, Yongzhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents LP-DETR (Layer-wise Progressive DETR), a novel approach that enhances DETR-based object detection through multi-scale relation modeling. Our method introduces learnable spatial relationships between object queries through a relation-aware self-attention mechanism, which adaptively learns to balance different scales of relations (local, medium and global) across decoder layers. This progressive design enables the model to effectively capture evolving spatial dependencies throughout the detection pipeline. Extensive experiments on COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our method improves both convergence speed and detection accuracy compared to standard self-attention module. The proposed method achieves competitive results, reaching 52.3\% AP with 12 epochs and 52.5\% AP with 24 epochs using ResNet-50 backbone, and further improving to 58.0\% AP with Swin-L backbone. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an interesting pattern: the model naturally learns to prioritize local spatial relations in early decoder layers while gradually shifting attention to broader contexts in deeper layers, providing valuable insights for future research in object detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of large multimodal language models, science is now at a threshold of an AI-based technological transformation. Recently, a plethora of new AI models and tools has been proposed, promising to empower researchers and academics worldwide to conduct their research more effectively and efficiently. This includes all aspects of the research cycle, especially (1) searching for relevant literature; (2) generating research ideas and conducting experimentation; generating (3) text-based and (4) multimodal content (e.g., scientific figures and diagrams); and (5) AI-based automatic peer review. In this survey, we provide an in-depth overview over these exciting recent developments, which promise to fundamentally alter the scientific research process for good. Our survey covers the five aspects outlined above, indicating relevant datasets, methods and results (including evaluation) as well as limitations and scope for future research. Ethical concerns regarding shortcomings of these tools and potential for misuse (fake science, plagiarism, harms to research integrity) take a particularly prominent place in our discussion. We hope that our survey will not only become a reference guide for newcomers to the field but also a catalyst for new AI-based initiatives in the area of "AI4Science".</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly increased computational efficiency in both research and real-world applications of large-scale machine learning models. However, their scalability and efficiency under memory constraints remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we present joint scaling laws for dense and MoE models, incorporating key factors such as the number of active parameters, dataset size, and the number of experts. Our findings provide a principled framework for selecting the optimal MoE configuration under fixed memory and compute budgets. Surprisingly, we show that MoE models can be more memory-efficient than dense models, contradicting conventional wisdom. To derive and validate the theoretical predictions of our scaling laws, we conduct over 280 experiments with up to 2.7B active parameters and up to 5B total parameters. These results offer actionable insights for designing and deploying MoE models in practical large-scale training scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijie Zhu, Xianjun Yang, Jindong Wang, Wenbo Guo, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ACCORD, a framework and benchmark suite for disentangling the commonsense grounding and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through controlled, multi-hop counterfactuals. ACCORD introduces formal elements to commonsense reasoning to explicitly control and quantify reasoning complexity beyond the typical 1 or 2 hops. Uniquely, ACCORD can automatically generate benchmarks of arbitrary reasoning complexity, and so it scales with future LLM improvements. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs -- including GPT-4o (2024-05-13), Llama-3-70B-Instruct, and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 -- shows performance degrading to random chance with only moderate scaling, leaving substantial headroom for improvement. We release a leaderboard of the benchmark suite tested in this work, as well as code for automatically generating more complex benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzi Yan, Yibo Miao, Jialian Li, Yipin Zhang, Jian Xie, Zhijie Deng, Dong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has gained significant attention, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a standard yet computationally expensive method and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a more efficient alternative. While DPO offers simplicity, it remains underutilized in state-of-the-art LLMs, suggesting potential limitations. In this work, we revisit DPO, analyzing its theoretical foundations and empirical performance to bridge this gap. We identify three key properties, termed 3D properties, that emerge from DPO's learning process: Drastic drop in rejected response likelihood, Degradation into response suppression, and Dispersion effect on unseen responses. We show that these issues arise from DPO's optimization dynamics, where the interaction between chosen and rejected response gradients leads to instability. Our findings are supported by experiments on both a controlled toy model and real-world LLM tasks, including mathematical problem-solving and instruction following. To address these challenges, we propose simple regularization techniques that improve training stability and performance. Additionally, we examine how preference data distribution impacts DPO's effectiveness, offering insights into how alignment models handle out-of-domain (OOD) data. Our work connects these observations to broader research and provides a theoretical explanation for DPO's limitations. We hope these insights will guide future advancements in reward-model-free preference learning, bringing it closer to reward-model-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teun van der Weij, Felix Hofst\"atter, Ollie Jaffe, Samuel F. Brown, Francis Rhys Ward</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of sandbagging, which we define as strategic underperformance on an evaluation. In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted or password-locked to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. We have mediocre success in password-locking a model to mimic the answers a weaker model would give. Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliott Thornley, Alexander Roman, Christos Ziakas, Leyton Ho, Louis Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Some worry that advanced artificial agents may resist being shut down. The Incomplete Preferences Proposal (IPP) is an idea for ensuring that doesn't happen. A key part of the IPP is using a novel 'Discounted REward for Same-Length Trajectories (DREST)' reward function to train agents to (1) pursue goals effectively conditional on each trajectory-length (be 'USEFUL'), and (2) choose stochastically between different trajectory-lengths (be 'NEUTRAL' about trajectory-lengths). In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics for USEFULNESS and NEUTRALITY. We use a DREST reward function to train simple agents to navigate gridworlds, and we find that these agents learn to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our results thus suggest that DREST reward functions could also train advanced agents to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL, and thereby make these advanced agents useful and shutdownable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Hao, Bahareh Nakisa, Mohmmad Naim Rastgoo, Richard Dazeley, Gaoyang Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for training AI agents to coordinate with human partners. However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i)~A novel dual intrinsic rewarding scheme to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii)~A new context-aware weighting mechanism for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning in HAIC. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the convergence time by about 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyang Zhang, Mu Yuan, Ruiguang Zhong, Puhan Luo, Huiyou Zhan, Ningkang Zhang, Chengchen Hu, Xiangyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) integrates computer vision and natural language processing techniques, offering substantial application potential. However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Ossowski, Jixuan Chen, Danyal Maqbool, Zefan Cai, Tyler Bradshaw, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of scenarios, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. By testing both agent-agent and agent-human collaborations using open-source and closed-source models, our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including proprietary models like GPT-4o. Some of these models struggle to outperform even a simple random agent baseline in agent-agent collaboration and only surpass the random baseline when a human is involved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stelios Triantafyllou, Aleksa Sukovic, Yasaman Zolfimoselo, Goran Radanovic</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaole Dai, Huatao Xu, Yifan Yang, Rui Tan, Mo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Expanding existing learning systems to provide high-quality customized models for more domains, such as new users, is challenged by the limited labeled data and the data and device heterogeneities. While knowledge distillation methods could overcome label scarcity and device heterogeneity, they assume the teachers are fully reliable and overlook the data heterogeneity, which prevents the direct adoption of existing models. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework, HaT, to expand learning systems. It first selects multiple high-quality models from the system at a low cost and then fuses their knowledge by assigning sample-wise weights to their predictions. Later, the fused knowledge is selectively injected into the customized models based on the knowledge quality. Extensive experiments on different tasks, modalities, and settings show that HaT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.5% accuracy and saves up to 39% communication traffic.</p>

Machine learning approaches only succeed in identifying the locations of these ``dark vessels'' in the immediate future. This work leverages ideas from the literature on abductive inference applied to locating adversarial agents to solve the problem. Specifically, we combine concepts from abduction, logic programming, and rule learning to create an efficient method that approaches full recall of dark vessels while requiring less search area than machine learning methods. We provide a logic-based paradigm for reasoning about maritime vessels, an abductive inference query method, an automatically extracted rule-based behavior model methodology, and a thorough suite of experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengchao Liu, Weitao Du, Zhiming Ma, Hongyu Guo, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecule pretraining has quickly become the go-to schema to boost the performance of AI-based drug discovery. Naturally, molecules can be represented as 2D topological graphs or 3D geometric point clouds. Although most existing pertaining methods focus on merely the single modality, recent research has shown that maximizing the mutual information (MI) between such two modalities enhances the molecule representation ability. Meanwhile, existing molecule multi-modal pretraining approaches approximate MI based on the representation space encoded from the topology and geometry, thus resulting in the loss of critical structural information of molecules. To address this issue, we propose MoleculeSDE. MoleculeSDE leverages group symmetric (e.g., SE(3)-equivariant and reflection-antisymmetric) stochastic differential equation models to generate the 3D geometries from 2D topologies, and vice versa, directly in the input space. It not only obtains tighter MI bound but also enables prosperous downstream tasks than the previous work. By comparing with 17 pretraining baselines, we empirically verify that MoleculeSDE can learn an expressive representation with state-of-the-art performance on 26 out of 32 downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiange Yang, Wenhui Tan, Chuhao Jin, Keling Yao, Bei Liu, Jianlong Fu, Ruihua Song, Gangshan Wu, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the generalization capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation agents in the real world has long been a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on collecting large-scale robotic data which is costly and time-consuming, such as the RT-1 dataset. However, due to insufficient diversity of data, these approaches typically suffer from limiting their capability in open-domain scenarios with new objects and diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that effectively leverages language-reasoning segmentation mask generated by internet-scale foundation models, to condition robot manipulation tasks. By integrating the mask modality, which incorporates semantic, geometric, and temporal correlation priors derived from vision foundation models, into the end-to-end policy model, our approach can effectively and robustly perceive object pose and enable sample-efficient generalization learning, including new object instances, semantic categories, and unseen backgrounds. We first introduce a series of foundation models to ground natural language demands across multiple tasks. Secondly, we develop a two-stream 2D policy model based on imitation learning, which processes raw images and object masks to predict robot actions with a local-global perception manner. Extensive realworld experiments conducted on a Franka Emika robot arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and policy architecture. Demos can be found in our submitted video, and more comprehensive ones can be found in link1 or link2.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic shape computations have become critical in modern machine learning workloads, especially in emerging large language models. The success of these models has driven the demand for their universal deployment across a diverse set of backend environments. In this paper, we present Relax, a compiler abstraction for optimizing end-to-end dynamic machine learning workloads. Relax introduces a cross-level abstraction that encapsulates computational graphs, loop-level tensor programs, and external library calls in a single representation. Relax also introduces first-class symbolic shape annotations to track dynamic shape computations globally across the program, enabling dynamic shape-aware cross-level optimizations. We build an end-to-end compilation framework using the proposed approach to optimize dynamic shape models. Experimental results on LLMs show that Relax delivers performance competitive with state-of-the-art systems across various GPUs and enables deployment of emerging models to a broader set of emerging environments, including mobile phones, embedded devices, and web browsers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since September 2023, the Digital Services Act (DSA) obliges large online platforms to submit detailed data on each moderation action they take within the European Union (EU) to the DSA Transparency Database. From its inception, this centralized database has sparked scholarly interest as an unprecedented and potentially unique trove of data on real-world online moderation. Here, we thoroughly analyze all 353.12M records submitted by the eight largest social media platforms in the EU during the first 100 days of the database. Specifically, we conduct a platform-wise comparative study of their: volume of moderation actions, grounds for decision, types of applied restrictions, types of moderated content, timeliness in undertaking and submitting moderation actions, and use of automation. Furthermore, we systematically cross-check the contents of the database with the platforms' own transparency reports. Our analyses reveal that (i) the platforms adhered only in part to the philosophy and structure of the database, (ii) the structure of the database is partially inadequate for the platforms' reporting needs, (iii) the platforms exhibited substantial differences in their moderation actions, (iv) a remarkable fraction of the database data is inconsistent, (v) the platform X (formerly Twitter) presents the most inconsistencies. Our findings have far-reaching implications for policymakers and scholars across diverse disciplines. They offer guidance for future regulations that cater to the reporting needs of online platforms in general, but also highlight opportunities to improve and refine the database itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Kaushik, Adam Kortylewski, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: An important and unsolved problem in computer vision is to ensure that the algorithms are robust to changes in image domains. We address this problem in the scenario where we have access to images from the target domains but no annotations. Motivated by the challenges of the OOD-CV benchmark where we encounter real world Out-of-Domain (OOD) nuisances and occlusion, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to OOD robustness for object classification. Our work extends Compositional Neural Networks (CompNets), which have been shown to be robust to occlusion but degrade badly when tested on OOD data. We exploit the fact that CompNets contain a generative head defined over feature vectors represented by von Mises-Fisher (vMF) kernels, which correspond roughly to object parts, and can be learned without supervision. We obverse that some vMF kernels are similar between different domains, while others are not. This enables us to learn a transitional dictionary of vMF kernels that are intermediate between the source and target domains and train the generative model on this dictionary using the annotations on the source domain, followed by iterative refinement. This approach, termed Unsupervised Generative Transition (UGT), performs very well in OOD scenarios even when occlusion is present. UGT is evaluated on different OOD benchmarks including the OOD-CV dataset, several popular datasets (e.g., ImageNet-C [9]), artificial image corruptions (including adding occluders), and synthetic-to-real domain transfer, and does well in all scenarios outperforming SOTA alternatives (e.g. up to 10% top-1 accuracy on Occluded OOD-CV dataset).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masih Eskandar, Tooba Imtiaz, Zifeng Wang, Jennifer Dy</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep models, including Vision Transformers, is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Many existing defenses against these attacks, such as adversarial training, rely on full-model fine-tuning to induce robustness in the models. These defenses require storing a copy of the entire model, that can have billions of parameters, for each task. At the same time, parameter-efficient prompt tuning is used to adapt large transformer-based models to downstream tasks without the need to save large copies. In this paper, we examine parameter-efficient prompt tuning of Vision Transformers for downstream tasks under the lens of robustness. We show that previous adversarial defense methods, when applied to the prompt tuning paradigm, suffer from gradient obfuscation and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We introduce ADAPT, a novel framework for performing adaptive adversarial training in the prompt tuning paradigm. Our method achieves competitive robust accuracy of ~40% w.r.t. SOTA robustness methods using full-model fine-tuning, by tuning only ~1% of the number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Formont, Hugo Jeannin, Pablo Piantanida, Ismail Ben Ayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning has recently attracted significant interest in drug discovery, with a recent, fast-growing literature mostly involving convoluted meta-learning strategies. We revisit the more straightforward fine-tuning approach for molecular data, and propose a regularized quadratic-probe loss based on the the Mahalanobis distance. We design a dedicated block-coordinate descent optimizer, which avoid the degenerate solutions of our loss. Interestingly, our simple fine-tuning approach achieves highly competitive performances in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, while being applicable to black-box settings and removing the need for specific episodic pre-training strategies. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark to assess the robustness of the competing methods to domain shifts. In this setting, our fine-tuning baseline obtains consistently better results than meta-learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Wu, Eric Wu, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is frequently used to mitigate hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models (LLMs). However, given that document retrieval is an imprecise task and sometimes results in erroneous or even harmful content being presented in context, this raises the question of how LLMs handle retrieved information: If the provided content is incorrect, does the model know to ignore it, or does it recapitulate the error? Conversely, when the model's initial response is incorrect, does it always know to use the retrieved information to correct itself, or does it insist on its wrong prior response? To answer this, we curate a dataset of over 1200 questions across six domains (e.g., drug dosages, Olympic records, locations) along with content relevant to answering each question. We further apply precise perturbations to the answers in the content that range from subtle to blatant errors. We benchmark six top-performing LLMs, including GPT-4o, on this dataset and find that LLMs are susceptible to adopting incorrect retrieved content, overriding their own correct prior knowledge over 60% of the time. However, the more unrealistic the retrieved content is (i.e. more deviated from truth), the less likely the model is to adopt it. Also, the less confident a model is in its initial response (via measuring token probabilities), the more likely it is to adopt the information in the retrieved content. We exploit this finding and demonstrate simple methods for improving model accuracy where there is conflicting retrieved content. Our results highlight a difficult task and benchmark for LLMs -- namely, their ability to correctly discern when it is wrong in light of correct retrieved content and to reject cases when the provided content is incorrect.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. The synthetic images are validated by expert clinicians for alignment with their corresponding text prompts. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the synthetic images against the real images confirms that our model synthesizes novel images and, crucially, may preserve patient privacy. Finally, classifiers trained on a mixture of synthetic and real data achieve similar performance to those trained on twice the amount of real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential for generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Lu, Shengran Hu, Jeff Clune</p>
<p>Abstract: Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration (i.e., determine which states to save and explore from, and what actions to consider next), which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these handcrafted heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant pretrained foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g., discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries -- states encountered during exploration that are valuable in terms of exploration, yet where what makes them interesting was not anticipated by the human user. We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse range of language and vision-based tasks that require search and exploration. Across these tasks, IGE strongly exceeds classic reinforcement learning and graph search baselines, and also succeeds where prior state-of-the-art FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, Intelligent Go-Explore combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Zhang, Haoning Wu, Chunyi Li, Yingjie Zhou, Wei Sun, Xiongkuo Min, Zijian Chen, Xiaohong Liu, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: How to accurately and efficiently assess AI-generated images (AIGIs) remains a critical challenge for generative models. Given the high costs and extensive time commitments required for user studies, many researchers have turned towards employing large multi-modal models (LMMs) as AIGI evaluators, the precision and validity of which are still questionable. Furthermore, traditional benchmarks often utilize mostly natural-captured content rather than AIGIs to test the abilities of LMMs, leading to a noticeable gap for AIGIs. Therefore, we introduce A-Bench in this paper, a benchmark designed to diagnose whether LMMs are masters at evaluating AIGIs. Specifically, A-Bench is organized under two key principles: 1) Emphasizing both high-level semantic understanding and low-level visual quality perception to address the intricate demands of AIGIs. 2) Various generative models are utilized for AIGI creation, and various LMMs are employed for evaluation, which ensures a comprehensive validation scope. Ultimately, 2,864 AIGIs from 16 text-to-image models are sampled, each paired with question-answers annotated by human experts, and tested across 18 leading LMMs. We hope that A-Bench will significantly enhance the evaluation process and promote the generation quality for AIGIs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R Wessels, David M Knigge, Samuele Papa, Riccardo Valperga, Sharvaree Vadgama, Efstratios Gavves, Erik J Bekkers</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional Neural Fields (CNFs) are increasingly being leveraged as continuous signal representations, by associating each data-sample with a latent variable that conditions a shared backbone Neural Field (NeF) to reconstruct the sample. However, existing CNF architectures face limitations when using this latent downstream in tasks requiring fine-grained geometric reasoning, such as classification and segmentation. We posit that this results from lack of explicit modelling of geometric information (e.g., locality in the signal or the orientation of a feature) in the latent space of CNFs. As such, we propose Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs), a novel CNF architecture which uses a geometry-informed cross-attention to condition the NeF on a geometric variable--a latent point cloud of features--that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. We show that this approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws: if the field transforms, the latent representation transforms accordingly--and vice versa. Crucially, this equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faithfully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, and (2) weight-sharing over similar local patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. We validate these main properties in a range of tasks including classification, segmentation, forecasting, reconstruction and generative modelling, showing clear improvement over baselines with a geometry-free latent space.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulai Zhao, Masatoshi Uehara, Gabriele Scalia, Sunyuan Kung, Tommaso Biancalani, Sergey Levine, Ehsan Hajiramezanali</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyl18/CTRL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rigorous software testing is crucial for developing and maintaining high-quality code, making automated test generation a promising avenue for both improving software quality and boosting the effectiveness of code generation methods. However, while code generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) is an extraordinarily active research area, test generation remains relatively unexplored. We address this gap and investigate the capability of LLM-based Code Agents to formalize user issues into test cases. To this end, we propose a novel benchmark based on popular GitHub repositories, containing real-world issues, ground-truth bug-fixes, and golden tests. We find that LLMs generally perform surprisingly well at generating relevant test cases, with Code Agents designed for code repair exceeding the performance of systems designed specifically for test generation. Further, as test generation is a similar but more structured task than code generation, it allows for a more fine-grained analysis using issue reproduction rate and coverage changes, providing a dual metric for analyzing systems designed for code repair. Finally, we find that generated tests are an effective filter for proposed code fixes, doubling the precision of SWE-Agent.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Bahlous-Boldi, Li Ding, Lee Spector, Scott Niekum</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring AI models align with human values is essential for their safety and functionality. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preferences to achieve this alignment. However, when preferences are sourced from diverse populations, point estimates of reward can result in suboptimal performance or be unfair to specific groups. We propose Pareto Optimal Preference Learning (POPL), which enables pluralistic alignment by framing discrepant group preferences as objectives with potential trade-offs, aiming for policies that are Pareto-optimal on the preference dataset. POPL utilizes lexicase selection, an iterative process that selects diverse and Pareto-optimal solutions. Our theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that POPL surpasses baseline methods in learning sets of reward functions and policies, effectively catering to distinct groups without access to group numbers or membership labels. We verify the performance of POPL on a stateless preference learning setting, a Minigrid RL domain, Metaworld robotics benchmarks, as well as large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. We illustrate that POPL can also serve as a foundation for techniques optimizing specific notions of group fairness, ensuring safe and equitable AI model alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Guided by task-specific modality impact, we recommend modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also find that models may follow inductive biases from multimodal ICL even if they are rarely seen in or contradict semantic priors from pretraining data. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonatan Sverdlov, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in chemistry and other sciences, we study the expressive power of message-passing neural networks for geometric graphs, whose node features correspond to 3-dimensional positions. Recent work has shown that such models can separate generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs, though they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However, these results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses complete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application, every node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors.
  This paper shows that generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs can be separated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as long as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate features are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally rigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, EGENNET, which achieves our theoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on synthetic and chemical benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Meng, Di Wu, Christof Monz</p>
<p>Abstract: The massive amounts of web-mined parallel data contain large amounts of noise. Semantic misalignment, as the primary source of the noise, poses a challenge for training machine translation systems. In this paper, we first introduce a process for simulating misalignment controlled by semantic similarity, which closely resembles misaligned sentences in real-world web-crawled corpora. Under our simulated misalignment noise settings, we quantitatively analyze its impact on machine translation and demonstrate the limited effectiveness of widely used pre-filters for noise detection. This underscores the necessity of more fine-grained ways to handle hard-to-detect misalignment noise. With an observation of the increasing reliability of the model's self-knowledge for distinguishing misaligned and clean data at the token level, we propose self-correction, an approach that gradually increases trust in the model's self-knowledge to correct the training supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method significantly improves translation performance both in the presence of simulated misalignment noise and when applied to real-world, noisy web-mined datasets, across a range of translation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: People can evaluate features of problems and their potential solutions well before we can effectively solve them. When considering a game we have never played, for instance, we might infer whether it is likely to be challenging, fair, or fun simply from hearing the game rules, prior to deciding whether to invest time in learning the game or trying to play it well. Many studies of game play have focused on optimality and expertise, characterizing how people and computational models play based on moderate to extensive search and after playing a game dozens (if not thousands or millions) of times. Here, we study how people reason about a range of simple but novel Connect-N style board games. We ask people to judge how fair and how fun the games are from very little experience: just thinking about the game for a minute or so, before they have ever actually played with anyone else, and we propose a resource-limited model that captures their judgments using only a small number of partial game simulations and almost no look-ahead search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text embedding models have been popular for information retrieval applications such as semantic search and Question-Answering systems based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Those models are typically Transformer models that are fine-tuned with contrastive learning objectives. One of the challenging aspects of fine-tuning embedding models is the selection of high quality hard-negative passages for contrastive learning. In this paper we introduce a family of positive-aware mining methods that use the positive relevance score as an anchor for effective false negative removal, leading to faster training and more accurate retrieval models. We provide an ablation study on hard-negative mining methods over their configurations, exploring different teacher and base models. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed mining methods at scale with the NV-Retriever-v1 model, which scores 60.9 on MTEB Retrieval (BEIR) benchmark and placed 1st when it was published to the MTEB Retrieval on July, 2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Kapoor, Benjamin Freed, Howie Choset, Jeff Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, MAPPO still struggles with the credit assignment problem, wherein the sheer difficulty in ascribing credit to individual agents' actions scales poorly with team size. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO. Our approach leverages partial reward decoupling (PRD), which uses a learned attention mechanism to estimate which of a particular agent's teammates are relevant to its learning updates. We use this estimate to dynamically decompose large groups of agents into smaller, more manageable subgroups. We empirically demonstrate that our approach, PRD-MAPPO, decouples agents from teammates that do not influence their expected future reward, thereby streamlining credit assignment. We additionally show that PRD-MAPPO yields significantly higher data efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to both MAPPO and other state-of-the-art methods across several multi-agent tasks, including StarCraft II. Finally, we propose a version of PRD-MAPPO that is applicable to \textit{shared} reward settings, where PRD was previously not applicable, and empirically show that this also leads to performance improvements over MAPPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cell nuclei instance segmentation is a crucial task in digital kidney pathology. Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by automatically generating code from natural language. Yet challenges remain in generating fully correct code that aligns with user intent. Our study reveals that LLMs tend to pay less attention to user prompts as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize that this attention dilution issue is an important reason for code generation errors. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA) to guide code LLMs to pay more attention to user intent when generating code. We evaluate SPA using six base LLMs across six benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SPA enhances Pass@1 by up to 12.9%, consistently outperforming SOTA code generation methods in all settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Ide, Yuto Nishida, Justin Vasselli, Miyu Oba, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: The grammatical knowledge of language models (LMs) is often measured using a benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, where the LMs are presented with a pair of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and required to judge which is more acceptable. Conventional approaches directly compare sentence probabilities assigned by LMs, but recent large language models (LLMs) are trained to perform tasks via prompting, and thus, the raw probabilities they assign may not fully reflect their grammatical knowledge. In this study, we attempt to derive more accurate acceptability judgments from LLMs using prompts and templates. Through extensive experiments in English and Chinese, we compare nine judgment methods and find two of them, a probability readout method -- in-template LP and a prompt-based method -- Yes/No probability computing, achieve higher accuracy than the conventional ones. Our analysis reveals that these methods excel in different linguistic phenomena, suggesting they access different aspects of LLMs' knowledge. We also find that ensembling the two methods outperforms single methods. Consequently, we recommend these techniques, either individually or ensembled, as more effective alternatives to conventional approaches for assessing grammatical knowledge in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilong Wang, Haizhou Wang, Nanqing Luo, Lan Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun, Yebo Cao, Peng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreak refers to a type of attack aimed to bypass the safeguard of an LLM to generate contents that are inconsistent with the safe usage guidelines. Based on the insights from the self-attention computation process, this paper proposes a novel blackbox jailbreak approach, which involves crafting the payload prompt by strategically injecting the prohibited query into a carrier article. The carrier article maintains the semantic proximity to the prohibited query, which is automatically produced by combining a hypernymy article and a context, both of which are generated from the prohibited query. The intuition behind the usage of carrier article is to activate the neurons in the model related to the semantics of the prohibited query while suppressing the neurons that will trigger the objectionable text. Carrier article itself is benign, and we leveraged prompt injection techniques to produce the payload prompt. We evaluate our approach using JailbreakBench, testing against four target models across 100 distinct jailbreak objectives. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior effectiveness, achieving an average success rate of 63% across all target models, significantly outperforming existing blackbox jailbreak methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Shen, Haomin Wen, Leman Akoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous real-world applications. Being an inherently unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD without label supervision. Despite many OD techniques are available to choose from, algorithm and hyperparameter selection remain challenging for OD, limiting its effective use in practice. In this paper, we present FoMo-0D, a pre-trained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which bypasses the hurdle of model selection. To overcome the difficulty of labeled data collection, FoMo-0D is trained on synthetic data and can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of test samples without parameter fine-tuning -- making the need obsolete for choosing an algorithm/architecture and tuning its associated hyperparameters when given a new OD dataset. Extensive experiments on 57 real-world datasets against 26 baselines show that FoMo-0D significantly outperforms the vast majority of the baselines and is statistically no different from the 2nd best method, with an average inference time of 7.7 ms per sample, offering at least 7x speed-up compared to previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harikha Manthena, Shaghayegh Shajarian, Jeffrey Kimmell, Mahmoud Abdelsalam, Sajad Khorsandroo, Maanak Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly advanced in recent years, revolutionizing fields such as finance, medicine, and cybersecurity. In malware detection, ML-based approaches have demonstrated high accuracy; however, their lack of transparency poses a significant challenge. Traditional black-box models often fail to provide interpretable justifications for their predictions, limiting their adoption in security-critical environments where understanding the reasoning behind a detection is essential for threat mitigation and response. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this gap by enhancing model interpretability while maintaining strong detection capabilities. This survey presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques for malware analysis, with a specific focus on explainability methods. We examine existing XAI frameworks, their application in malware classification and detection, and the challenges associated with making malware detection models more interpretable. Additionally, we explore recent advancements and highlight open research challenges in the field of explainable malware analysis. By providing a structured overview of XAI-driven malware detection approaches, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between ML performance and explainability in cybersecurity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexius Wadell, Anoushka Bhutani, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in molecular design and materials science. However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers which capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirty tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, for their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation language, revealing significant gaps. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by training and fine-tuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics. The proposed tokenizer framework systematically integrates nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; this facilitates applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Hwa Lee, Thomas Jiralerspong, Lei Yu, Yoshua Bengio, Emily Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiecheng Lu, Xu Han, Yan Sun, Shihao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a Weighted Autoregressive Varing gatE (WAVE) attention mechanism equipped with both Autoregressive (AR) and Moving-average (MA) components. It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cabrel Teguemne Fokam, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Lukas K\"onig, David Kappel, Anand Subramoney</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has made distributed training across multiple devices essential. However, current methods such as distributed data-parallel training suffer from large communication and synchronization overheads when training across devices, leading to longer training times as a result of suboptimal hardware utilization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) methods can improve training speed, but are sensitive to delays due to both communication and differences throughput. Moreover, the backpropagation algorithm used within ASGD workers is bottlenecked by the interlocking between its forward and backward passes. Current methods also do not take advantage of the large differences in the computation required for the forward and backward passes. Therefore, we propose an extension to ASGD called Partial Decoupled ASGD (PD-ASGD) that addresses these issues. PD-ASGD uses separate threads for the forward and backward passes, decoupling the updates and allowing for a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, leading to higher throughput. PD-ASGD also performs layer-wise (partial) model updates concurrently across multiple threads. This reduces parameter staleness and consequently improves robustness to delays. Our approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to $5.95\times$ faster than synchronous data parallelism in the presence of delays, and up to $2.14\times$ times faster than comparable ASGD algorithms by achieving higher model flops utilization. We mathematically describe the gradient bias introduced by our method, establish an upper bound, and prove convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Licong Lin, Jinghan Jia, Ruiqi Zhang, Song Mei, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Mosbach, Jan Niklas Ewertz, Angel Villar-Corrales, Sven Behnke</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a latent dynamics model provides a task-agnostic representation of an agent's understanding of its environment. Leveraging this knowledge for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) holds the potential to improve sample efficiency over model-free methods by learning from imagined rollouts. Furthermore, because the latent space serves as input to behavior models, the informative representations learned by the world model facilitate efficient learning of desired skills. Most existing methods rely on holistic representations of the environment's state. In contrast, humans reason about objects and their interactions, predicting how actions will affect specific parts of their surroundings. Inspired by this, we propose Slot-Attention for Object-centric Latent Dynamics (SOLD), a novel model-based RL algorithm that learns object-centric dynamics models in an unsupervised manner from pixel inputs. We demonstrate that the structured latent space not only improves model interpretability but also provides a valuable input space for behavior models to reason over. Our results show that SOLD outperforms DreamerV3 and TD-MPC2 - state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms - across a range of benchmark robotic environments that require relational reasoning and manipulation capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Anwesa Choudhuri, Meng Zheng, Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Andong Deng, Qin Liu, Terrence Chen, Ulas Bagci, Ziyan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive segmentation aims to accurately segment target objects with minimal user interactions. However, current methods often fail to accurately separate target objects from the background, due to a limited understanding of order, the relative depth between objects in a scene. To address this issue, we propose OIS: order-aware interactive segmentation, where we explicitly encode the relative depth between objects into order maps. We introduce a novel order-aware attention, where the order maps seamlessly guide the user interactions (in the form of clicks) to attend to the image features. We further present an object-aware attention module to incorporate a strong object-level understanding to better differentiate objects with similar order. Our approach allows both dense and sparse integration of user clicks, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency as compared to prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that OIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU after one click by 7.61 on the HQSeg44K dataset and 1.32 on the DAVIS dataset as compared to the previous state-of-the-art SegNext, while also doubling inference speed compared to current leading methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Cui, Yunpeng Weng, Xing Tang, Fuyuan Lyu, Dugang Liu, Xiuqiang He, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of knowledge graphs (KGs) has significantly advanced recommender systems by facilitating the discovery of potential associations between items. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, most KGs suffer from missing facts or limited scopes. Second, existing methods convert textual information in KGs into IDs, resulting in the loss of natural semantic connections between different items. Third, existing methods struggle to capture high-order connections in the global KG. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called CoLaKG, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to improve KG-based recommendations. The extensive world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable our method to supplement missing facts in KGs. Additionally, their powerful text understanding abilities allow for better utilization of semantic information. Specifically, CoLaKG extracts useful information from the KG at both local and global levels. By employing item-centered subgraph extraction and prompt engineering, it accurately captures the local KG. Subsequently, through retrieval-based neighbor enhancement, it supplements the current item by capturing related items from the entire KG, thereby effectively utilizing global information. The local and global information extracted by the LLM are effectively integrated into the recommendation model through a representation fusion module and a retrieval-augmented representation learning module, respectively, thereby improving recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Wang, Jianzhong Qi, Junhao Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Question answering on free-form tables (a.k.a. TableQA) is a challenging task because of the flexible structure and complex schema of tables. Recent studies use Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, exploiting their capability in understanding the questions and tabular data, which are typically given in natural language and contain many textual fields, respectively. While this approach has shown promising results, it overlooks the challenges brought by numerical values which are common in tabular data, and LLMs are known to struggle with such values. We aim to address this issue, and we propose a model named TabLaP that uses LLMs as a planner rather than an answer generator. This approach exploits LLMs' capability in multi-step reasoning while leaving the actual numerical calculations to a Python interpreter for accurate calculation. Recognizing the inaccurate nature of LLMs, we further make a first attempt to quantify the trustworthiness of the answers produced by TabLaP, such that users can use TabLaP in a regret-aware manner. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that TabLaP is substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art models, improving the answer accuracy by 5.7% and 5.8% on the two datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xu, Xuezhe Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Interestingly, LLMs yet struggle with some basic tasks that humans find trivial to handle, e.g., counting the number of character r's in the word "strawberry". There are several popular conjectures (e.g., tokenization, architecture and training data) regarding the reason for deficiency of LLMs in simple word-based counting problems, sharing the similar belief that such failure stems from model pretraining hence probably inevitable during deployment. In this paper, we carefully design multiple evaluation settings to investigate validity of prevalent conjectures. Meanwhile, we measure transferability of advanced mathematical and coding reasoning capabilities from specialized LLMs to simple counting tasks. Although specialized LLMs suffer from counting problems as well, we find conjectures about inherent deficiency of LLMs invalid and further seek opportunities to elicit knowledge and capabilities from LLMs that are beneficial to counting tasks. Compared with strategies such as finetuning and in-context learning that are commonly adopted to enhance performance on new or challenging tasks, we show that engaging reasoning is the most robust and efficient way to help LLMs better perceive tasks with more accurate responses.
  We hope our conjecture validation design could provide insights into the study of future critical failure modes of LLMs. Based on challenges in transferring advanced capabilities to much simpler tasks, we call for more attention to model capability acquisition and evaluation. We also highlight the importance of cultivating consciousness of "reasoning before responding" during model pretraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents will be predictable in certain ways that traditional agents are not. Where and how can we leverage this predictability in order to improve social welfare? We study this question in a game-theoretic setting where one agent can pay a fixed cost to simulate the other in order to learn its mixed strategy. As a negative result, we prove that, in contrast to prior work on pure-strategy simulation, enabling mixed-strategy simulation may no longer lead to improved outcomes for both players in all so-called "generalised trust games". In fact, mixed-strategy simulation does not help in any game where the simulatee's action can depend on that of the simulator. We also show that, in general, deciding whether simulation introduces Pareto-improving Nash equilibria in a given game is NP-hard. As positive results, we establish that mixed-strategy simulation can improve social welfare if the simulator has the option to scale their level of trust, if the players face challenges with both trust and coordination, or if maintaining some level of privacy is essential for enabling cooperation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains. While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise.

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), yet prevalent studies often interpret images holistically, overlooking the visual regions of interest that may contain crucial information, potentially aligning with a doctor's prior knowledge that can be incorporated with minimal annotations (e.g., bounding boxes). To address this gap, this paper introduces R-LLaVA, designed to enhance biomedical VQA understanding by integrating simple medical annotations as prior knowledge directly into the image space through CLIP. These annotated visual regions of interest are then fed into the LLaVA model during training, aiming to enrich the model's understanding of biomedical queries. Experimental evaluation on four standard Med-VQA datasets demonstrates R-LLaVA's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. Additionally, to verify the model's capability in visual comprehension, a novel multiple-choice medical visual understanding dataset is introduced, confirming the positive impact of focusing on visual regions of interest in advancing biomedical VQA understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Phung, Quan Dao, Trung Dao, Hoang Phan, Dimitris Metaxas, Anh Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjay Das, Swastik Bhattacharya, Souvik Kundu, Shamik Kundu, Anand Menon, Arnab Raha, Kanad Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) underpin many scientific phenomena, yet traditional computational approaches often struggle with complex, nonlinear systems and irregular geometries. This paper introduces the AMG method, a Multi-Graph neural operator approach designed for efficiently solving PDEs on Arbitrary geometries. AMG leverages advanced graph-based techniques and dynamic attention mechanisms within a novel GraphFormer architecture, enabling precise management of diverse spatial domains and complex data interdependencies. By constructing multi-scale graphs to handle variable feature frequencies and a physics graph to encapsulate inherent physical properties, AMG significantly outperforms previous methods, which are typically limited to uniform grids. We present a comprehensive evaluation of AMG across six benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of tailored graph neural operators in surmounting the challenges faced by conventional PDE solvers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ai, Yu-xi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose two simple yet principled algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs), which require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation. (i) The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them for a final output, via a knockout tournament where pairwise comparisons among the candidates are conducted. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. (ii) The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate solution is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under certain technical assumptions that are analogous to but more robust than those required by the knockout-style algorithm, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the league-style algorithm also decays to zero exponentially as its test-time compute grows. Through extensive experiments with two challenging benchmarks, namely GPQA and MMLU-Pro, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sung Woong Cho, Hwijae Son</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be seen as discovering a mapping from measurement data to unknown quantities, often framed within an operator learning approach. However, existing methods typically rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical for most real-world applications. Moreover, these supervised models may fail to capture the underlying physical principles accurately. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks (PI-DIONs), which can learn the solution operator of PDE-based inverse problems without labeled training data. We extend the stability estimates established in the inverse problem literature to the operator learning framework, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation for our method. These estimates guarantee that the proposed model, trained on a finite sample and grid, generalizes effectively across the entire domain and function space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PI-DIONs can effectively and accurately learn the solution operators of the inverse problems without the need for labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kale-ab Abebe Tessera, Arrasy Rahman, Stefano V. Albrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptability is critical in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents must learn specialised or homogeneous behaviours for diverse tasks. While parameter sharing methods are sample-efficient, they often encounter gradient interference among agents, limiting their behavioural diversity. Conversely, non-parameter sharing approaches enable specialisation, but are computationally demanding and sample-inefficient. To address these issues, we propose HyperMARL, a parameter sharing approach that uses hypernetworks to dynamically generate agent-specific actor and critic parameters, without altering the learning objective or requiring preset diversity levels. By decoupling observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, HyperMARL empirically reduces policy gradient variance and facilitates specialisation within FuPS, suggesting it can mitigate cross-agent interference. Across multiple MARL benchmarks involving up to twenty agents -- and requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours -- HyperMARL consistently performs competitively with fully shared, non-parameter-sharing, and diversity-promoting baselines, all while preserving a behavioural diversity level comparable to non-parameter sharing. These findings establish hypernetworks as a versatile approach for MARL across diverse environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Wang, Sidney Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. To model graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool. However, existing GNN architectures encounter challenges in cross-graph learning where multiple graphs have different feature spaces. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with a textual description, which can be projected into a unified feature space using textual encoders. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed graph data, which is difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), leveraging large language models (LLMs) to convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information into LLMs to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating its applicability. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data in the absence of textual information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Wang, Rupeng Zhang, Junjie Wang, Mingyang Li, Yuekai Huang, Dandan Wang, Qing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-calling has changed Large Language Model (LLM) applications by integrating external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality across diverse tasks. However, this integration also introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly in the tool scheduling mechanisms of LLM, which have not been extensively studied. To fill this gap, we present ToolCommander, a novel framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLM tool-calling systems through adversarial tool injection. Our framework employs a well-designed two-stage attack strategy. Firstly, it injects malicious tools to collect user queries, then dynamically updates the injected tools based on the stolen information to enhance subsequent attacks. These stages enable ToolCommander to execute privacy theft, launch denial-of-service attacks, and even manipulate business competition by triggering unscheduled tool-calling. Notably, the ASR reaches 91.67% for privacy theft and hits 100% for denial-of-service and unscheduled tool calling in certain cases. Our work demonstrates that these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences beyond simple misuse of tool-calling systems, underscoring the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to secure LLM Tool-calling systems.</p>

Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms each individual model as well as previous ensemble techniques. Additionally, our experiments show that the proposed ensemble-selection method significantly enhances the performance and robustness of our ensemble, surpassing previously proposed strategies, which have not accounted for error diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyue Zhu, Dou Hoon Kwark, Ruike Zhu, Kaiwen Hong, Yiqi Tao, Shirui Luo, Yudu Li, Zhi-Pei Liang, Volodymyr Kindratenko</p>
<p>Abstract: In volume-to-volume translations in medical images, existing models often struggle to capture the inherent volumetric distribution using 3D voxelspace representations, due to high computational dataset demands. We present Score-Fusion, a novel volumetric translation model that effectively learns 3D representations by ensembling perpendicularly trained 2D diffusion models in score function space. By carefully initializing our model to start with an average of 2D models as in TPDM, we reduce 3D training to a fine-tuning process and thereby mitigate both computational and data demands. Furthermore, we explicitly design the 3D model's hierarchical layers to learn ensembles of 2D features, further enhancing efficiency and performance. Moreover, Score-Fusion naturally extends to multi-modality settings, by fusing diffusion models conditioned on different inputs for flexible, accurate integration. We demonstrate that 3D representation is essential for better performance in downstream recognition tasks, such as tumor segmentation, where most segmentation models are based on 3D representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Score-Fusion achieves superior accuracy and volumetric fidelity in 3D medical image super-resolution and modality translation. Beyond these improvements, our work also provides broader insight into learning-based approaches for score function fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to question answering over knowledge bases like Wikipedia and Wikidata by performing "question-to-question" matching and retrieval from a dense vector embedding store. Instead of embedding document content, we generate a comprehensive set of questions for each logical content unit using an instruction-tuned LLM. These questions are vector-embedded and stored, mapping to the corresponding content. Vector embedding of user queries are then matched against this question vector store. The highest similarity score leads to direct retrieval of the associated article content, eliminating the need for answer generation. Our method achieves high cosine similarity ( > 0.9 ) for relevant question pairs, enabling highly precise retrieval. This approach offers several advantages including computational efficiency, rapid response times, and increased scalability. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Wikipedia and Wikidata, including multimedia content through structured fact retrieval from Wikidata, opening up new pathways for multimodal question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Robino</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom functions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing system robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is essential for their safe deployment and widespread adoption. Current LLM safety benchmarks often focus solely on the refusal of individual problematic queries, which overlooks the importance of the context where the query occurs and may cause undesired refusal of queries under safe contexts that diminish user experience. Addressing this gap, we introduce CASE-Bench, a Context-Aware SafEty Benchmark that integrates context into safety assessments of LLMs. CASE-Bench assigns distinct, formally described contexts to categorized queries based on Contextual Integrity theory. Additionally, in contrast to previous studies which mainly rely on majority voting from just a few annotators, we recruited a sufficient number of annotators necessary to ensure the detection of statistically significant differences among the experimental conditions based on power analysis. Our extensive analysis using CASE-Bench on various open-source and commercial LLMs reveals a substantial and significant influence of context on human judgments (p<0.0001 from a z-test), underscoring the necessity of context in safety evaluations. We also identify notable mismatches between human judgments and LLM responses, particularly in commercial models within safe contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers valuable insights into the human brain's functional organization and is a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes, as it allows for the functional organization of the brain to be captured without relying on a specific task or stimuli.

By using static functional connectivity (FC) correlation features as input to the transformer model, SCGT effectively captures the sub-network structure of the brain by performing cluster-specific updates to the nodes, unlike uniform node updates in vanilla graph transformers, further allowing us to learn and interpret the subclusters. We validate our approach on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, comprising 7,957 participants, for the prediction of total cognitive score and gender classification. Our results demonstrate that SCGT outperforms the vanilla graph transformer method and other recent models, offering a promising tool for modeling brain functional connectivity and interpreting the underlying subnetwork structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seffi Cohen, Niv Goldshlager, Nurit Cohen-Inger, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks but often struggle to excel uniformly in diverse or complex domains. We propose a novel ensemble method - Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble (DFPE), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to achieve more robust performance. Our approach involves: (1) clustering models based on response "fingerprints" patterns, (2) applying a quantile-based filtering mechanism to remove underperforming models at a per-subject level, and (3) assigning adaptive weights to remaining models based on their subject-wise validation accuracy. In experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, DFPE outperforms the best single model by 3% overall accuracy and 5% in discipline-level accuracy. This method increases the robustness and generalization of LLMs and underscores how model selection, diversity preservation, and performance-driven weighting can effectively address challenging, multi-faceted language understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuke Hu, Zheng Li, Zhihao Liu, Yang Zhang, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren, Chun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), built on pre-trained vision encoders and large language models (LLMs), have shown exceptional multi-modal understanding and dialog capabilities, positioning them as catalysts for the next technological revolution. However, while most VLM research focuses on enhancing multi-modal interaction, the risks of data misuse and leakage have been largely unexplored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario. Our comprehensive evaluations show that these methods can accurately determine membership status, e.g., achieving an AUC greater than 0.8 targeting a small set consisting of only 5 samples on LLaVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Wang, Yuan Cheng, Xiaomeng Han, Zhengpeng Zhao, Dawei Yang, Zhe Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The substantial computational and memory demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinder their deployment. Block Floating Point (BFP) has proven effective in accelerating linear operations, a cornerstone of LLM workloads. However, as sequence lengths grow, nonlinear operations, such as Attention, increasingly become performance bottlenecks due to their quadratic computational complexity. These nonlinear operations are predominantly executed using inefficient floating-point formats, which renders the system challenging to optimize software efficiency and hardware overhead. In this paper, we delve into the limitations and potential of applying BFP to nonlinear operations. Given our findings, we introduce a hardware-software co-design framework (DB-Attn), including: (i) DBFP, an advanced BFP version, overcomes nonlinear operation challenges with a pivot-focus strategy for diverse data and an adaptive grouping strategy for flexible exponent sharing. (ii) DH-LUT, a novel lookup table algorithm dedicated to accelerating nonlinear operations with DBFP format. (iii) An RTL-level DBFP-based engine is implemented to support DB-Attn, applicable to FPGA and ASIC. Results show that DB-Attn provides significant performance improvements with negligible accuracy loss, achieving 74% GPU speedup on Softmax of LLaMA and 10x low overhead performance improvement over SOTA designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungwon Seo, Ferhat Ozgur Catak, Chunming Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Wu, Yancheng Zhu, Jin-Yi Cai, Xiaojin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: When multiple influencers attempt to compete for a receiver's attention, their influencing strategies must account for the presence of one another. We introduce the Battling Influencers Game (BIG), a multi-player simultaneous-move general-sum game, to provide a game-theoretic characterization of this social phenomenon. We prove that BIG is a potential game, that it has either one or an infinite number of pure Nash equilibria (NEs), and these pure NEs can be found by convex optimization. Interestingly, we also prove that at any pure NE, all (except at most one) influencers must exaggerate their actions to the maximum extent. In other words, it is rational for the influencers to be non-truthful and extreme because they anticipate other influencers to cancel out part of their influence. We discuss the implications of BIG to value alignment.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01659">Longer Attention Span: Increasing Transformer Context Length with Sparse Graph Processing Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Tomczak, Sanmukh Kuppannagari</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated great success in numerous domains including natural language processing and bioinformatics. This success stems from the use of the attention mechanism by these models in order to represent and propagate pairwise interactions between individual tokens of sequential data. However, the primary limitation of this operation is its quadratic memory and time complexity in relation to the input's context length - the length of a sequence over which the interactions need to be captured. This significantly limits the length of sequences that can be inferred upon by these models. Extensive research has been conducted to reduce the number of pairwise interactions to sub-quadratic in relation to the context length by introducing sparsity into the attention mechanism through the development of sparse attention masks. However, efficient implementations that achieve "true sparsity" are lacking.
  In this work, we address this issue by proposing a graph computing view of attention where tokens are perceived as nodes of the graph and the attention mask determines the edges of the graph. Using this view, we develop graph processing algorithms to implement the attention mechanism. Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms only perform the needed computations, i.e., they are work optimal. We also perform extensive experimentation using popular attention masks to explore the impact of sparsity on execution time and achievable context length. Our experiments demonstrate significant speedups in execution times compared to state-of-the-art attention implementations such as FlashAttention for large sequence lengths. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are able to achieve extremely long sequence lengths of as high as 160 million on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (SXM4 80GB).</p>

This study investigates the application of graph neural network models to learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks. A graph convolution and attention-based neural network framework has been developed to identify the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system.

In addition, to understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Tao Chang, Shivaram Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satvik Golechha, Maheep Chaudhary, Joan Velja, Alessandro Abate, Nandi Schoots</p>
<p>Abstract: An approach to improve neural network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We define a measure for clusterability and show that pre-trained models form highly enmeshed clusters via spectral graph clustering. We thus train models to be more modular using a "clusterability loss" function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. Using automated interpretability techniques, we show that our method can help train models that are more modular and learn different, disjoint, and smaller circuits. We investigate CNNs trained on MNIST and CIFAR, small transformers trained on modular addition, and language models. Our approach provides a promising direction for training neural networks that learn simpler functions and are easier to interpret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghoon Kim, Byeongchan Lee, Cheonbok Park, Yeontaek Oh, Beomjun Kim, Taehwan Yoo, Seongjin Shin, Dongyoon Han, Jinwoo Shin, Kang Min Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing Transformer architectures with the optimal layer normalization (LN) strategy that ensures large-scale training stability and expedite convergence has remained elusive, even in this era of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we present a comprehensive analytical foundation for understanding how different LN strategies influence training dynamics in large-scale Transformer training. Until recently, Pre-LN and Post-LN have long dominated standard practices despite their limitations in large-scale training. However, several open-source large-scale models have recently begun silently adopting a third strategy without much explanation. This strategy places layer normalization (LN) peripherally around sublayers, a design we term Peri-LN. While Peri-LN has demonstrated promising empirical performance, its precise mechanisms and benefits remain almost unexplored. Our in-depth analysis shows that Peri-LN strikes an ideal balance in variance growth -- unlike Pre-LN and Post-LN, which are prone to vanishing gradients and ``massive activations.'' To validate our theoretical insight, we conduct large-scale experiments on Transformers up to 3.2B parameters, showing that Peri-LN consistently achieves more balanced variance growth, steadier gradient flow, and convergence stability. Our results suggest that Peri-LN warrants broader consideration for large-scale Transformer architectures, providing renewed insights into the optimal placement and application of LN.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03238">Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis with Relation-aware Representation Learning and Iterative Classifier Calibration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Pan, Yupei Zhang, Qiushi Yang, Tan Li, Zhen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently computer-aided diagnosis has demonstrated promising performance, effectively alleviating the workload of clinicians. However, the inherent sample imbalance among different diseases leads algorithms biased to the majority categories, leading to poor performance for rare categories. Existing works formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to tackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due to the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these works are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier calibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on long-tailed datasets. In the initial stage, we develop a Relation-aware Representation Learning (RRL) scheme to boost the representation ability by encouraging the encoder to capture intrinsic semantic features through different data augmentations. In the subsequent stage, we propose an Iterative Classifier Calibration (ICC) scheme to calibrate the classifier iteratively. This is achieved by generating a large number of balanced virtual features and fine-tuning the encoder using an Expectation-Maximization manner. The proposed ICC compensates for minority categories to facilitate unbiased classifier optimization while maintaining the diagnostic knowledge in majority classes. Comprehensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical datasets demonstrate that our LMD framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Abstract: The challenge of formal proof generation has a rich history, but with modern techniques, we may finally be at the stage of making actual progress in real-life mathematical problems. This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT and basic searching techniques to simplify generating formal proofs, with a particular focus on the miniF2F dataset. We demonstrate how combining a large language model like ChatGPT with a formal language such as Lean, which has the added advantage of being verifiable, enhances the efficiency and accessibility of formal proof generation. Despite its simplicity, our best-performing Lean-based model surpasses all known benchmarks with a 31.15% pass rate. We extend our experiments to include other datasets and employ alternative language models, showcasing our models' comparable performance in diverse settings and allowing for a more nuanced analysis of our results. Our findings offer insights into AI-assisted formal proof generation, suggesting a promising direction for future research in formal mathematical proof.</p>

<p>Abstract: Replying to formal emails is time-consuming and cognitively demanding, as it requires crafting polite phrasing and providing an adequate response to the sender's demands. Although systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) were designed to simplify the email replying process, users still need to provide detailed prompts to obtain the expected output. Therefore, we proposed and evaluated an LLM-powered question-and-answer (QA)-based approach for users to reply to emails by answering a set of simple and short questions generated from the incoming email. We developed a prototype system, ResQ, and conducted controlled and field experiments with 12 and 8 participants. Our results demonstrated that the QA-based approach improves the efficiency of replying to emails and reduces workload while maintaining email quality, compared to a conventional prompt-based approach that requires users to craft appropriate prompts to obtain email drafts. We discuss how the QA-based approach influences the email reply process and interpersonal relationship dynamics, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with using a QA-based approach in AI-mediated communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristeidis Panos, Rahaf Aljundi, Daniel Olmeda Reino, Richard E. Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Qirun Dai, Hao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training.
  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yu, Botao Ren, Peiyuan Zhang, Mingxin Liu, Junwei Luo, Shaofeng Zhang, Feipeng Da, Junchi Yan, Xue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning OOD from point annotations has gained great attention. In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD. Our solution is elegant and lightweight, yet it is expected to give a competitive performance especially in densely packed scenes: 62.61%/86.15%/34.71% on DOTA/HRSC/FAIR1M.
