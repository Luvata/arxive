<p><b>Authors:</b> Sowmya S Sundaram, Balaji Alwar</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of unwarranted beliefs, spanning pseudoscience, logical fallacies, and conspiracy theories, presents substantial societal hurdles and the risk of disseminating misinformation. Utilizing established psychometric assessments, this study explores the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) vis-a-vis the average human in detecting prevalent logical pitfalls. We undertake a philosophical inquiry, juxtaposing the rationality of humans against that of LLMs. Furthermore, we propose methodologies for harnessing LLMs to counter misconceptions, drawing upon psychological models of persuasion such as cognitive dissonance theory and elaboration likelihood theory. Through this endeavor, we highlight the potential of LLMs as personalized misinformation debunking agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Regina Hurley, Dan Maxwell, Jon McLellan, Finn Wilson, John Beverley</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing reliance on digital twins across various industries and domains brings with it semantic interoperability challenges. Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Eric Austin, Anton Korikov, Armin Toroghi, Scott Sanner</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing preference elicitation (PE) methodologies that can quickly ascertain a user's top item preferences in a cold-start setting is a key challenge for building effective and personalized conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems. While large language models (LLMs) constitute a novel technology that enables fully natural language (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches lack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively balance the NL exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an arbitrary item set. In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods define theoretically optimal PE strategies, but fail to use NL item descriptions or generate NL queries, unrealistically assuming users can express preferences with direct item ratings and comparisons. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that seeks to generate NL queries which actively elicit natural language feedback to reduce uncertainty over item utilities to identify the best recommendation. We demonstrate our framework in a novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) between user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain preference beliefs and BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling (TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to guide LLM query generation. We numerically evaluate our methods in controlled experiments, finding that PEBOL achieves up to 131% improvement in MAP@10 after 10 turns of cold start NL-PE dialogue compared to monolithic GPT-3.5, despite relying on a much smaller 400M parameter NLI model for preference inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Wen Song, Yining Ma, Jie Zhang, Chi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has garnered much attention. However, most neural solvers are only structured and trained independently on a specific problem, making them less generic and practical. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified neural solver that can cope with a range of VRP variants simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. We further develop a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity. Experimentally, our method significantly promotes the zero-shot generalization performance on 10 unseen VRP variants, and showcases decent results on the few-shot setting and real-world benchmark instances. We further provide extensive studies on the effect of MoE configurations in solving VRPs. Surprisingly, the hierarchical gating can achieve much better out-of-distribution generalization performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyao Feng, Anthony Hunter</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), is an important aspect of natural language understanding. Most research now uses machine learning and deep learning to perform this task on specific datasets, meaning their solution is not explainable nor explicit. To address the need for an explainable approach to RTE, we propose a novel pipeline that is based on translating text into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph. For this we use a pre-trained AMR parser. We then translate the AMR graph into propositional logic and use a SAT solver for automated reasoning. In text, often commonsense suggests that an entailment (or contradiction) relationship holds between a premise and a claim, but because different wordings are used, this is not identified from their logical representations. To address this, we introduce relaxation methods to allow replacement or forgetting of some propositions. Our experimental results show this pipeline performs well on four RTE datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qunwei Lin, Qian Leng, Zhicheng Ding, Chao Yan, Xiaonan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the pursuit of environmental sustainability, the aviation industry faces the challenge of minimizing its ecological footprint. Among the key solutions is contrail avoidance, targeting the linear ice-crystal clouds produced by aircraft exhaust. These contrails exacerbate global warming by trapping atmospheric heat, necessitating precise segmentation and comprehensive analysis of contrail images to gauge their environmental impact. However, this segmentation task is complex due to the varying appearances of contrails under different atmospheric conditions and potential misalignment issues in predictive modeling. This paper presents an innovative deep-learning approach utilizing the efficient net-b4 encoder for feature extraction, seamlessly integrating misalignment correction, soft labeling, and pseudo-labeling techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of contrail detection in satellite imagery. The proposed methodology aims to redefine contrail image analysis and contribute to the objectives of sustainable aviation by providing a robust framework for precise contrail detection and analysis in satellite imagery, thus aiding in the mitigation of aviation's environmental impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Holzhausen, Mia Merlid, H{\aa}kon Olav Torvik, Anders Malthe-S{\o}renssen, Mikkel Elle Lepper{\o}d</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation-optimized artificial neural networks, while precise, lack robustness, leading to unforeseen behaviors that affect their safety. Biological neural systems do solve some of these issues already. Thus, understanding the biological mechanisms of robustness is an important step towards building trustworthy and safe systems. Unlike artificial models, biological neurons adjust connectivity based on neighboring cell activity. Robustness in neural representations is hypothesized to correlate with the smoothness of the encoding manifold. Recent work suggests power law covariance spectra, which were observed studying the primary visual cortex of mice, to be indicative of a balanced trade-off between accuracy and robustness in representations. Here, we show that unsupervised local learning models with winner takes all dynamics learn such power law representations, providing upcoming studies a mechanistic model with that characteristic. Our research aims to understand the interplay between geometry, spectral properties, robustness, and expressivity in neural representations. Hence, we study the link between representation smoothness and spectrum by using weight, Jacobian and spectral regularization while assessing performance and adversarial robustness. Our work serves as a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying power law spectra and optimally smooth encodings in both biological and artificial systems. The insights gained may elucidate the mechanisms that realize robust neural networks in mammalian brains and inform the development of more stable and reliable artificial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Zapaishchykova, Benjamin H. Kann, Divyanshu Tak, Zezhong Ye, Daphne A. Haas-Kogan, Hugo J. W. L. Aerts</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic longitudinal brain MRI simulates brain aging and would enable more efficient research on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. Synthetically generated, age-adjusted brain images could serve as valuable alternatives to costly longitudinal imaging acquisitions, serve as internal controls for studies looking at the effects of environmental or therapeutic modifiers on brain development, and allow data augmentation for diverse populations. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based approach called SynthBrainGrow for synthetic brain aging with a two-year step. To validate the feasibility of using synthetically-generated data on downstream tasks, we compared structural volumetrics of two-year-aged brains against synthetically-aged brain MRI. Results show that SynthBrainGrow can accurately capture substructure volumetrics and simulate structural changes such as ventricle enlargement and cortical thinning. Our approach provides a novel way to generate longitudinal brain datasets from cross-sectional data to enable augmented training and benchmarking of computational tools for analyzing lifespan trajectories. This work signifies an important advance in generative modeling to synthesize realistic longitudinal data with limited lifelong MRI scans. The code is available at XXX.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Du, Tho V. Le</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis (SA) of comments on YouTube videos related to Sidewalk Delivery Robots (SDRs). We manually annotated the collected YouTube comments with three sentiment labels: negative (0), positive (1), and neutral (2). We then constructed models for text sentiment classification and tested the models' performance on both binary and ternary classification tasks in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results indicate that, in binary classification tasks, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and N-gram get the highest accuracy. In ternary classification tasks, the model using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) significantly outperforms other machine learning models, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.78. Additionally, we employ the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to generate 10 topics from the comments to explore the public's underlying views on SDRs. Drawing from these findings, we propose targeted recommendations for shaping future policies concerning SDRs. This work provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the SDR sector regarding social perception, interaction, and safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haechan Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the increasing significance of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and the emergence of UAV swarms for collaborative operations in various domains. However, the effectiveness of UAV swarms can be severely compromised by jamming technology, necessitating robust antijamming strategies. While existing methods such as frequency hopping and physical path planning have been explored, there remains a gap in research on path planning for UAV swarms when the jammer's location is unknown. To address this, a novel approach, where UAV swarms leverage collective intelligence to predict jamming areas, evade them, and efficiently reach target destinations, is proposed. This approach utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to predict the location and intensity of jamming areas based on information gathered from each UAV. A multi-agent control algorithm is then employed to disperse the UAV swarm, avoid jamming, and regroup upon reaching the target. Through simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated, showcasing accurate prediction of jamming areas and successful evasion through obstacle avoidance algorithms, ultimately achieving the mission objective. Proposed method offers robustness, scalability, and computational efficiency, making it applicable across various scenarios where UAV swarms operate in potentially hostile environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: One critical bottleneck that impedes the development and deployment of autonomous transportation in open-pit mines is guaranteed robustness and trustworthiness in prohibitively extreme scenarios. In this research, a novel scenarios engineering (SE) methodology for the autonomous mining truck is proposed for open-pit mines. SE increases the trustworthiness and robustness of autonomous trucks from four key components: Scenario Feature Extractor, Intelligence & Index (I&I), Calibration & Certification (C&C), and Verification & Validation (V&V). Scenario feature extractor is a comprehensive pipeline approach that captures complex interactions and latent dependencies in complex mining scenarios. I&I effectively enhances the quality of the training dataset, thereby establishing a solid foundation for autonomous transportation in mining areas. C&C is grounded in the intrinsic regulation, capabilities, and contributions of the intelligent systems employed in autonomous transportation to align with traffic participants in the real world and ensure their performance through certification. V&V process ensures that the autonomous transportation system can be correctly implemented, while validation focuses on evaluating the ability of the well-trained model to operate efficiently in the complex and dynamic conditions of the open-pit mines. This methodology addresses the unique challenges of autonomous transportation in open-pit mining, promoting productivity, safety, and performance in mining operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengyu Wu, Yi Qi, Kaiwen Cai, Gaojie Jin, Xinping Yi, Xiaowei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is acknowledged as the next generation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and hold great promise in effectively processing spatial-temporal information. However, the choice of timestep becomes crucial as it significantly impacts the accuracy of the neural network training. Specifically, a smaller timestep indicates better performance in efficient computing, resulting in reduced latency and operations. While, using a small timestep may lead to low accuracy due to insufficient information presentation with few spikes. This observation motivates us to develop an SNN that is more reliable for adaptive timestep by introducing a novel regularisation technique, namely Spatial-Temporal Regulariser (STR). Our approach regulates the ratio between the strength of spikes and membrane potential at each timestep. This effectively balances spatial and temporal performance during training, ultimately resulting in an Anytime Optimal Inference (AOI) SNN. Through extensive experiments on frame-based and event-based datasets, our method, in combination with cutoff based on softmax output, achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both latency and accuracy. Notably, with STR and cutoff, SNN achieves 2.14 to 2.89 faster in inference compared to the pre-configured timestep with near-zero accuracy drop of 0.50% to 0.64% over the event-based datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David M. Markowitz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance public trust in science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from PNAS, yoked to those generated by AI, this work assessed linguistic simplicity across such summaries and public perceptions. Study 1a analyzed simplicity features of PNAS abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used GPT-4 to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Finally, Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written GPT summaries facilitated more favorable public perceptions of scientists (their credibility, trustworthiness) than more complexly-written human PNAS summaries. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Furui Cheng, Vil\'em Zouhar, Robin Shing Moon Chan, Daniel F\"urst, Hendrik Strobelt, Mennatallah El-Assady</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual examples are useful for exploring the decision boundaries of machine learning models and determining feature attributions. How can we apply counterfactual-based methods to analyze and explain LLMs? We identify the following key challenges. First, the generated textual counterfactuals should be meaningful and readable to users and thus can be mentally compared to draw conclusions. Second, to make the solution scalable to long-form text, users should be equipped with tools to create batches of counterfactuals from perturbations at various granularity levels and interactively analyze the results. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges and contribute 1) a novel algorithm for generating batches of complete and meaningful textual counterfactuals by removing and replacing text segments in different granularities, and 2) LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization tool to help users understand an LLM's behaviors by interactively inspecting and aggregating meaningful counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by the grammatical correctness of its generated counterfactuals using 1,000 samples from medical, legal, finance, education, and news datasets. In our experiments, 97.2% of the counterfactuals are grammatically correct. Through a use case, user studies, and feedback from experts, we demonstrate the usefulness and usability of the proposed interactive visualization tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simranjit Singh, Michael Fore, Dimitrios Stamoulis</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in remote sensing (RS) applications. However, existing benchmarks assume question-answering input templates over predefined image-text data pairs. These standalone instructions neglect the intricacies of realistic user-grounded tasks. Consider a geospatial analyst: they zoom in a map area, they draw a region over which to collect satellite imagery, and they succinctly ask "Detect all objects here". Where is `here`, if it is not explicitly hardcoded in the image-text template, but instead is implied by the system state, e.g., the live map positioning? To bridge this gap, we present GeoLLM-QA, a benchmark designed to capture long sequences of verbal, visual, and click-based actions on a real UI platform. Through in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs over a diverse set of 1,000 tasks, we offer insights towards stronger agents for RS applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomin Yu, Yezhaohui Wang, Yanfang Chen, Zhen Tao, Dinghao Xi, Shichao Song, Simin Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence models, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), have revolutionized content production methods. These artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) have become deeply embedded in various aspects of daily life and work, spanning texts, images, videos, and audio. The authenticity of AI-generated content is progressively enhancing, approaching human-level creative standards. However, these technologies have also led to the emergence of Fake Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (FAIGC), posing new challenges in distinguishing genuine information. It is crucial to recognize that AIGC technology is akin to a double-edged sword; its potent generative capabilities, while beneficial, also pose risks for the creation and dissemination of FAIGC. In this survey, We propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of FAIGC methods today. Next, we explore the modalities and generative technologies of FAIGC, categorized under AI-generated disinformation and AI-generated misinformation. From various perspectives, we then introduce FAIGC detection methods, including Deceptive FAIGC Detection, Deepfake Detection, and Hallucination-based FAIGC Detection. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges and promising areas for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyin Wang, Chufan Gao, Bolun Liu, Qiping Xu, Guleid Hussein, Mohamad El Labban, Kingsley Iheasirim, Hariprasad Korsapati, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in handling clinical text summarization tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that a small open-source LLM can be effectively trained to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. We achieve this through a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model. This process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced an enhanced approach, termed DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini Pro serving as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, is capable of generating clinical notes that are comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. Notably, in the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness compared to physician-authored notes (4.1/5). Additionally, we identified caveats in public clinical note datasets, such as ACI-BENCH. We highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format. Overall, our research demonstrates the potential and feasibility of training smaller, open-source LLMs to assist with clinical documentation, capitalizing on healthcare institutions' access to patient records and domain expertise. We have made our newly created synthetic clinic dialogue-note dataset and the physician feedback dataset publicly available to foster future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Liu, Hongjian Zhou, Yining Hua, Omid Rohanian, Lei Clifton, David A. Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians has attracted remarkable attention. Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended question-answering task with answer options for evaluation. However, in real clinical settings, many clinical decisions, such as treatment recommendations, involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. Meanwhile, existing studies mainly use accuracy to assess model performance. In this paper, we comprehensively benchmark diverse LLMs in healthcare, to clearly understand their strengths and weaknesses. Our benchmark contains seven tasks and thirteen datasets across medical language generation, understanding, and reasoning. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the existing sixteen LLMs in healthcare under both zero-shot and few-shot (i.e., 1,3,5-shot) learning settings. We report the results on five metrics (i.e. matching, faithfulness, comprehensiveness, generalizability, and robustness) that are critical in achieving trust from clinical users. We further invite medical experts to conduct human evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Obtaining sufficient information in one's mother tongue is crucial for satisfying the information needs of the users. While high-resource languages have abundant online resources, the situation is less than ideal for very low-resource languages. Moreover, the insufficient reporting of vital national and international events continues to be a worry, especially in languages with scarce resources, like \textbf{Mizo}. In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate the effectiveness of a simple methodology designed to generate a holistic summary for Mizo news articles, which leverages English-language news to supplement and enhance the information related to the corresponding news events. Furthermore, we make available 500 Mizo news articles and corresponding enriched holistic summaries. Human evaluation confirms that our approach significantly enhances the information coverage of Mizo news articles.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs) against malicious exploitation is paramount, with recent focus on mitigating offensive responses. Yet, the understanding of cant or dark jargon remains unexplored. This paper introduces a domain-specific Cant dataset and CantCounter evaluation framework, employing Fine-Tuning, Co-Tuning, Data-Diffusion, and Data-Analysis stages. Experiments reveal LLMs, including ChatGPT, are susceptible to cant bypassing filters, with varying recognition accuracy influenced by question types, setups, and prompt clues. Updated models exhibit higher acceptance rates for cant queries. Moreover, LLM reactions differ across domains, e.g., reluctance to engage in racism versus LGBT topics. These findings underscore LLMs' understanding of cant and reflect training data characteristics and vendor approaches to sensitive topics. Additionally, we assess LLMs' ability to demonstrate reasoning capabilities. Access to our datasets and code is available at https://github.com/cistineup/CantCounter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Bach Nguyen, Paul Youssef, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: As NLP models become more complex, understanding their decisions becomes more crucial. Counterfactuals (CFs), where minimal changes to inputs flip a model's prediction, offer a way to explain these models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks, their efficacy in generating high-quality CFs remains uncertain. This work fills this gap by investigating how well LLMs generate CFs for two NLU tasks. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of several common LLMs, and evaluate their CFs, assessing both intrinsic metrics, and the impact of these CFs on data augmentation. Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated CFs, providing insights for future research directions. Our results show that LLMs generate fluent CFs, but struggle to keep the induced changes minimal. Generating CFs for Sentiment Analysis (SA) is less challenging than NLI where LLMs show weaknesses in generating CFs that flip the original label. This also reflects on the data augmentation performance, where we observe a large gap between augmenting with human and LLMs CFs. Furthermore, we evaluate LLMs' ability to assess CFs in a mislabelled data setting, and show that they have a strong bias towards agreeing with the provided labels. GPT4 is more robust against this bias and its scores correlate well with automatic metrics. Our findings reveal several limitations and point to potential future work directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Htoo Wai Aung, Jiao Jiao Li, Yang An, Steven W. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) rely on accurately decoding electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) signals for effective device control. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in this regard, by leveraging the spatial relationships between EEG electrodes through adjacency matrices. The EEG_GLT-Net framework, featuring the state-of-the-art EEG_GLT adjacency matrix method, has notably enhanced EEG MI signal classification, evidenced by an average accuracy of 83.95% across 20 subjects on the PhysioNet dataset. This significantly exceeds the 76.10% accuracy rate achieved using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method within the same framework.
  In this research, we advance the field by applying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the classification of EEG MI signals. Our innovative method empowers the RL agent, enabling not only the classification of EEG MI data points with higher accuracy, but effective identification of EEG MI data points that are less distinct. We present the EEG_RL-Net, an enhancement of the EEG_GLT-Net framework, which incorporates the trained EEG GCN Block from EEG_GLT-Net at an adjacency matrix density of 13.39% alongside the RL-centric Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling DQN) block. The EEG_RL-Net model showcases exceptional classification performance, achieving an unprecedented average accuracy of 96.40% across 20 subjects within 25 milliseconds. This model illustrates the transformative effect of the RL in EEG MI time point classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents a transformative potential for enhancing operational efficiency and health outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their capabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical systems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential of ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been examined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient departments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency for outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both within-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low (mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in healthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs and AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors principles, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient triage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted methods for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters and memory usage while achieving comparable performance to full fine-tuning. We aim to assess the viability of training and serving LLMs fine-tuned with LoRA in real-world applications. First, we measure the quality of LLMs fine-tuned with quantized low rank adapters across 10 base models and 31 tasks for a total of 310 models. We find that 4-bit LoRA fine-tuned models outperform base models by 34 points and GPT-4 by 10 points on average. Second, we investigate the most effective base models for fine-tuning and assess the correlative and predictive capacities of task complexity heuristics in forecasting the outcomes of fine-tuning. Finally, we evaluate the latency and concurrency capabilities of LoRAX, an open-source Multi-LoRA inference server that facilitates the deployment of multiple LoRA fine-tuned models on a single GPU using shared base model weights and dynamic adapter loading. LoRAX powers LoRA Land, a web application that hosts 25 LoRA fine-tuned Mistral-7B LLMs on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB memory. LoRA Land highlights the quality and cost-effectiveness of employing multiple specialized LLMs over a single, general-purpose LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxi Song, Ruihan Qin, Huixia Ren, Zhen Liang, Yi Guo, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-center data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability significantly challenge the intelligent diagnosis of diseases using brain signals. A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy He, Darren Key, Mason Bulling, Andrew Chang, Skyler Shapiro, Everett Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the leading hardware accelerator for deep learning applications and are used widely in training and inference of transformers; transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many areas of machine learning and are especially used in most modern Large Language Models (LLMs). However, GPUs require large amounts of energy, which poses environmental concerns, demands high operational costs, and causes GPUs to be unsuitable for edge computing. We develop an accelerator for transformers, namely, Llama 2, an open-source state-of-the-art LLM, using high level synthesis (HLS) on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). HLS allows us to rapidly prototype FPGA designs without writing code at the register-transfer level (RTL). We name our method HLSTransform, and the FPGA designs we synthesize with HLS achieve up to a 12.75x reduction and 8.25x reduction in energy used per token on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA compared to an Intel Xeon Broadwell E5-2686 v4 CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU respectively, while increasing inference speeds by up to 2.46x compared to CPU and maintaining 0.53x the speed of an RTX 3090 GPU despite the GPU's 4 times higher base clock rate. With the lack of existing open-source FPGA accelerators for transformers, we open-source our code and document our steps for synthesis. We hope this work will serve as a step in democratizing the use of FPGAs in transformer inference and inspire research into energy-efficient inference methods as a whole.

<p>Abstract: There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurodegenerative condition necessitating early diagnosis for effective intervention. This paper introduces an innovative method for diagnosing Parkinson's disease through the analysis of human EEG signals, employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model. this research presents novel contributions to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive review of EEG signal analysis techniques and machine learning methods. Drawing from recent studies, we have engineered an advanced SVM-based model optimized for Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Utilizing cutting-edge feature engineering, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and kernel selection, our method achieves not only heightened diagnostic accuracy but also emphasizes model interpretability, catering to both clinicians and researchers. Moreover, ethical concerns in healthcare machine learning, such as data privacy and biases, are conscientiously addressed. We assess our method's performance through experiments on a diverse dataset comprising EEG recordings from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls, demonstrating significantly improved diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional techniques. In conclusion, this paper introduces an innovative SVM-based approach for diagnosing Parkinson's disease from human EEG signals. Building upon the IEEE framework and previous research, its novelty lies in the capacity to enhance diagnostic accuracy while upholding interpretability and ethical considerations for practical healthcare applications. These advances promise to revolutionize early Parkinson's disease detection and management, ultimately contributing to enhanced patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calarina Muslimani, Matthew E. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: To create useful reinforcement learning (RL) agents, step zero is to design a suitable reward function that captures the nuances of the task. However, reward engineering can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Instead, human-in-the-loop (HitL) RL allows agents to learn reward functions from human feedback. Despite recent successes, many of the HitL RL methods still require numerous human interactions to learn successful reward functions. To improve the feedback efficiency of HitL RL methods (i.e., require less feedback), this paper introduces Sub-optimal Data Pre-training, SDP, an approach that leverages reward-free, sub-optimal data to improve scalar- and preference-based HitL RL algorithms. In SDP, we start by pseudo-labeling all low-quality data with rewards of zero. Through this process, we obtain free reward labels to pre-train our reward model. This pre-training phase provides the reward model a head start in learning, whereby it can identify that low-quality transitions should have a low reward, all without any actual feedback. Through extensive experiments with a simulated teacher, we demonstrate that SDP can significantly improve or achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) HitL RL algorithms across nine robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Soft Preference Optimization (SPO), a method for aligning generative models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with human preferences, without the need for a reward model. SPO optimizes model outputs directly over a preference dataset through a natural loss function that integrates preference loss with a regularization term across the model's entire output distribution rather than limiting it to the preference dataset. Although SPO does not require the assumption of an existing underlying reward model, we demonstrate that, under the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, it converges to a softmax of scaled rewards, with the distribution's "softness" adjustable via the softmax exponent, an algorithm parameter. We showcase SPO's methodology, its theoretical foundation, and its comparative advantages in simplicity, computational efficiency, and alignment precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Wook Kim, Hyung-Kwon Ko, Grace Myers, Benjamin Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike traditional educational chatbots that rely on pre-programmed responses, large-language model-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate remarkable versatility and have the potential to serve as a dynamic resource for addressing student needs from understanding advanced concepts to solving complex problems. This work explores the impact of such technology on student learning in an interdisciplinary, project-oriented data visualization course. Throughout the semester, students engaged with ChatGPT across four distinct projects, including data visualizations and implementing them using a variety of tools including Tableau, D3, and Vega-lite. We collected conversation logs and reflection surveys from the students after each assignment. In addition, we conducted interviews with selected students to gain deeper insights into their overall experiences with ChatGPT. Our analysis examined the advantages and barriers of using ChatGPT, students' querying behavior, the types of assistance sought, and its impact on assignment outcomes and engagement. Based on the findings, we discuss design considerations for an educational solution that goes beyond the basic interface of ChatGPT, specifically tailored for data visualization education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjae Lee, Jinjun Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching programming in early childhood (4-9) to enhance computational thinking has gained popularity in the recent movement of computer science for all. However, current practices ignore some fundamental issues resulting from young children's developmental readiness, such as the sustained capability to keyboarding, the decomposition of complex tasks to small tasks, the need for intuitive mapping from abstract programming to tangible outcomes, and the limited amount of screen time exposure. To address these issues in this paper, we present a novel methodology with an AI-powered integration platform to effectively teach computational thinking for young children. The system features a hybrid pedagogy that supports both the top-down and bottom-up approach for teaching computational thinking. Young children can describe their desired task in natural language, while the system can respond with an easy-to-understand program consisting of the right level of decomposed sub-tasks. A tangible robot can immediately execute the decomposed program and demonstrate the program's outcomes to young children. The system is equipped with an intelligent chatbot that can interact with young children through natural languages, and children can speak to the chatbot to complete all the needed programming tasks, while the chatbot orchestrates the execution of the program onto the robot. This would completely eliminates the need of keyboards for young children to program. By developing such a system, we aim to make the concept of computational thinking more accessible to young children, fostering a natural understanding of programming concepts without the need of explicit programming skills. Through the interactive experience provided by the robotic agent, our system seeks to engage children in an effective manner, contributing to the field of educational technology for early childhood computer science education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoning Li, Yusong Wang, Mingyu Li, Jian Zhang, Bin Shao, Nanning Zheng, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a crucial technique for simulating biological systems, enabling the exploration of their dynamic nature and fostering an understanding of their functions and properties. To address exploration inefficiency, emerging enhanced sampling approaches like coarse-graining (CG) and generative models have been employed. In this work, we propose a \underline{Frame-to-Frame} generative model with guided \underline{Flow}-matching (F$3$low) for enhanced sampling, which (a) extends the domain of CG modeling to the SE(3) Riemannian manifold; (b) retreating CGMD simulations as autoregressively sampling guided by the former frame via flow-matching models; (c) targets the protein backbone, offering improved insights into secondary structure formation and intricate folding pathways. Compared to previous methods, F$3$low allows for broader exploration of conformational space. The ability to rapidly generate diverse conformations via force-free generative paradigm on SE(3) paves the way toward efficient enhanced sampling methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Wang, Yiping Li, Xiangzheng Fu, Xiucai Ye, Junfeng Shi, Gary G. Yen, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have exhibited unprecedented potential as biomaterials in combating multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence for novel AMP design, challenges pertaining to conflicting attributes such as activity, hemolysis, and toxicity have significantly impeded the progress of researchers. This paper introduces a paradigm shift by considering multiple attributes in AMP design.
  Presented herein is a novel approach termed Hypervolume-driven Multi-objective Antimicrobial Peptide Design (HMAMP), which prioritizes the simultaneous optimization of multiple attributes of AMPs. By synergizing reinforcement learning and a gradient descent algorithm rooted in the hypervolume maximization concept, HMAMP effectively expands exploration space and mitigates the issue of pattern collapse. This method generates a wide array of prospective AMP candidates that strike a balance among diverse attributes. Furthermore, we pinpoint knee points along the Pareto front of these candidate AMPs. Empirical results across five benchmark models substantiate that HMAMP-designed AMPs exhibit competitive performance and heightened diversity. A detailed analysis of the helical structures and molecular dynamics simulations for ten potential candidate AMPs validates the superiority of HMAMP in the realm of multi-objective AMP design. The ability of HMAMP to systematically craft AMPs considering multiple attributes marks a pioneering milestone, establishing a universal computational framework for the multi-objective design of AMPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshi Wu, Yiming Hao, Manyuan Zhang, Keqiang Sun, Zhaoyang Huang, Guanglu Song, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing a text-to-image diffusion model with a given reward function is an important but underexplored research area. In this study, we propose Deep Reward Tuning (DRTune), an algorithm that directly supervises the final output image of a text-to-image diffusion model and back-propagates through the iterative sampling process to the input noise. We find that training earlier steps in the sampling process is crucial for low-level rewards, and deep supervision can be achieved efficiently and effectively by stopping the gradient of the denoising network input. DRTune is extensively evaluated on various reward models. It consistently outperforms other algorithms, particularly for low-level control signals, where all shallow supervision methods fail. Additionally, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (SDXL 1.0) model via DRTune to optimize Human Preference Score v2.1, resulting in the Favorable Diffusion XL 1.0 (FDXL 1.0) model. FDXL 1.0 significantly enhances image quality compared to SDXL 1.0 and reaches comparable quality compared with Midjourney v5.2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohanad Odema, Luke Chen, Hyoukjun Kwon, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging multi-model workloads with heavy models like recent large language models significantly increased the compute and memory demands on hardware. To address such increasing demands, designing a scalable hardware architecture became a key problem. Among recent solutions, the 2.5D silicon interposer multi-chip module (MCM)-based AI accelerator has been actively explored as a promising scalable solution due to their significant benefits in the low engineering cost and composability. However, previous MCM accelerators are based on homogeneous architectures with fixed dataflow, which encounter major challenges from highly heterogeneous multi-model workloads due to their limited workload adaptivity. Therefore, in this work, we explore the opportunity in the heterogeneous dataflow MCM AI accelerators. We identify the scheduling of multi-model workload on heterogeneous dataflow MCM AI accelerator is an important and challenging problem due to its significance and scale, which reaches O(10^18) scale even for a single model case on 6x6 chiplets. We develop a set of heuristics to navigate the huge scheduling space and codify them into a scheduler with advanced techniques such as inter-chiplet pipelining. Our evaluation on ten multi-model workload scenarios for datacenter multitenancy and AR/VR use-cases has shown the efficacy of our approach, achieving on average 35.3% and 31.4% less energy-delay product (EDP) for the respective applications settings compared to homogeneous baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Battash, Amit Rozner, Lior Wolf, Ofir Lindenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image models that can generate high-quality and diverse images based on textual prompts have shown remarkable success. These models aim ultimately to create complex scenes, and addressing the challenge of multi-subject generation is a critical step towards this goal. However, the existing state-of-the-art diffusion models face difficulty when generating images that involve multiple subjects. When presented with a prompt containing more than one subject, these models may omit some subjects or merge them together. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach based on a guiding principle. We allow the diffusion model to initially propose a layout, and then we rearrange the layout grid. This is achieved by enforcing cross-attention maps (XAMs) to adhere to proposed masks and by migrating pixels from latent maps to new locations determined by us. We introduce new loss terms aimed at reducing XAM entropy for clearer spatial definition of subjects, reduce the overlap between XAMs, and ensure that XAMs align with their respective masks. We contrast our approach with several alternative methods and show that it more faithfully captures the desired concepts across a variety of text prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce WorkBench: a benchmark dataset for evaluating agents' ability to execute tasks in a workplace setting. WorkBench contains a sandbox environment with five databases, 26 tools, and 690 tasks. These tasks represent common business activities, such as sending emails and scheduling meetings. The tasks in WorkBench are challenging as they require planning, tool selection, and often multiple actions. If a task has been successfully executed, one (or more) of the database values may change. The correct outcome for each task is unique and unambiguous, which allows for robust, automated evaluation. We call this key contribution outcome-centric evaluation. We evaluate five existing ReAct agents on WorkBench, finding they successfully complete as few as 3% of tasks (Llama2-70B), and just 43% for the best-performing (GPT-4). We further find that agents' errors can result in the wrong action being taken, such as an email being sent to the wrong person. WorkBench reveals weaknesses in agents' ability to undertake common business activities, raising questions about their use in high-stakes workplace settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Mahmoud Sajjadi Mohammadabadi, Lei Yang, Feng Yan, Junshan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Multi-agent Learning (DML) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, inherent heterogeneity in agents' resources (computation, communication, and task size) may lead to substantial variations in training time. This heterogeneity creates a bottleneck, lengthening the overall training time due to straggler effects and potentially wasting spare resources of faster agents. To minimize training time in heterogeneous environments, we present a Communication-Efficient Training Workload Balancing for Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning (ComDML), which balances the workload among agents through a decentralized approach. Leveraging local-loss split training, ComDML enables parallel updates, where slower agents offload part of their workload to faster agents. To minimize the overall training time, ComDML optimizes the workload balancing by jointly considering the communication and computation capacities of agents, which hinges upon integer programming. A dynamic decentralized pairing scheduler is developed to efficiently pair agents and determine optimal offloading amounts. We prove that in ComDML, both slower and faster agents' models converge, for convex and non-convex functions. Furthermore, extensive experimental results on popular datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10) and their non-I.I.D. variants, with large models such as ResNet-56 and ResNet-110, demonstrate that ComDML can significantly reduce the overall training time while maintaining model accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art methods. ComDML demonstrates robustness in heterogeneous environments, and privacy measures can be seamlessly integrated for enhanced data protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Moradi, Ke Yan, David Colwell, Rhona Asgari</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated software testing is integral to the software development process, streamlining workflows and ensuring product reliability. Visual testing within this context, especially concerning user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) validation, stands as one of crucial determinants of overall software quality. Nevertheless, conventional methods like pixel-wise comparison and region-based visual change detection fall short in capturing contextual similarities, nuanced alterations, and understanding the spatial relationships between UI elements. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based method for visual change detection in software test automation. Leveraging a machine learning model, our method accurately identifies UI controls from software screenshots and constructs a graph representing contextual and spatial relationships between the controls. This information is then used to find correspondence between UI controls within screenshots of different versions of a software. The resulting graph encapsulates the intricate layout of the UI and underlying contextual relations, providing a holistic and context-aware model. This model is finally used to detect and highlight visual regressions in the UI. Comprehensive experiments on different datasets showed that our change detector can accurately detect visual software changes in various simple and complex test scenarios. Moreover, it outperformed pixel-wise comparison and region-based baselines by a large margin in more complex testing scenarios. This work not only contributes to the advancement of visual change detection but also holds practical implications, offering a robust solution for real-world software test automation challenges, enhancing reliability, and ensuring the seamless evolution of software interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma, Minh-Hao Van, Xintao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have recently emerged and gained the spotlight for their ability to comprehend the dual modality of image and textual data. VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini have recently shown impressive performance on tasks such as natural image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and spatial reasoning. Additionally, a universal segmentation model by Meta AI, Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows unprecedented performance at isolating objects from unforeseen images. Since medical experts, biologists, and materials scientists routinely examine microscopy or medical images in conjunction with textual information in the form of captions, literature, or reports, and draw conclusions of great importance and merit, it is indubitably essential to test the performance of VLMs and foundation models such as SAM, on these images. In this study, we charge ChatGPT, LLaVA, Gemini, and SAM with classification, segmentation, counting, and VQA tasks on a variety of microscopy images. We observe that ChatGPT and Gemini are impressively able to comprehend the visual features in microscopy images, while SAM is quite capable at isolating artefacts in a general sense. However, the performance is not close to that of a domain expert - the models are readily encumbered by the introduction of impurities, defects, artefact overlaps and diversity present in the images.</p>

Interestingly, these algorithms are often tested without applying a discount, a phenomenon we refer as the \textit{train-test bias}. In response to these challenges, we propose the Markov Flow Policy, which utilizes a non-negative neural network flow to enable comprehensive forward-view predictions.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning applications on extremely low-power devices, commonly referred to as tiny machine learning (TinyML), promises a smarter and more connected world. However, the advancement of current TinyML research is hindered by the limited size and quality of pertinent datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Wake Vision, a large-scale, diverse dataset tailored for person detection -- the canonical task for TinyML visual sensing. Wake Vision comprises over 6 million images, which is a hundredfold increase compared to the previous standard, and has undergone thorough quality filtering. Using Wake Vision for training results in a 2.41\% increase in accuracy compared to the established benchmark. Alongside the dataset, we provide a collection of five detailed benchmark sets that assess model performance on specific segments of the test data, such as varying lighting conditions, distances from the camera, and demographic characteristics of subjects. These novel fine-grained benchmarks facilitate the evaluation of model quality in challenging real-world scenarios that are often ignored when focusing solely on overall accuracy. Through an evaluation of a MobileNetV2 TinyML model on the benchmarks, we show that the input resolution plays a more crucial role than the model width in detecting distant subjects and that the impact of quantization on model robustness is minimal, thanks to the dataset quality. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed evaluation to identify essential factors for model development. The dataset, benchmark suite, code, and models are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, enabling their use for commercial use cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models appear quite creative, often performing on par with the average human on creative tasks. However, research on LLM creativity has focused solely on \textit{products}, with little attention on the creative \textit{process}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to LLMs. We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and LLMs explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. LLMs were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Zhang, Yancheng Liang, Yi Wu, Fei Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms often struggle to find strategies close to Pareto optimal Nash Equilibrium, owing largely to the lack of efficient exploration. The problem is exacerbated in sparse-reward settings, caused by the larger variance exhibited in policy learning. This paper introduces MESA, a novel meta-exploration method for cooperative multi-agent learning. It learns to explore by first identifying the agents' high-rewarding joint state-action subspace from training tasks and then learning a set of diverse exploration policies to "cover" the subspace. These trained exploration policies can be integrated with any off-policy MARL algorithm for test-time tasks. We first showcase MESA's advantage in a multi-step matrix game. Furthermore, experiments show that with learned exploration policies, MESA achieves significantly better performance in sparse-reward tasks in several multi-agent particle environments and multi-agent MuJoCo environments, and exhibits the ability to generalize to more challenging tasks at test time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background and Purpose: Identifying the thromboembolism source in ischemic stroke is crucial for treatment and secondary prevention yet is often undetermined. This study describes a self-supervised deep learning approach in digital pathology of emboli for classifying ischemic stroke clot origin from histopathological images. Methods: The dataset included whole slide images (WSI) from the STRIP AI Kaggle challenge, consisting of retrieved clots from ischemic stroke patients following mechanical thrombectomy. Transformer-based deep learning models were developed using transfer learning and self-supervised pretraining for classifying WSI. Customizations included an attention pooling layer, weighted loss function, and threshold optimization. Various model architectures were tested and compared, and model performances were primarily evaluated using weighted logarithmic loss. Results: The model achieved a logloss score of 0.662 in cross-validation and 0.659 on the test set. Different model backbones were compared, with the swin_large_patch4_window12_384 showed higher performance. Thresholding techniques for clot origin classification were employed to balance false positives and negatives. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the extent of efficacy of transformer-based deep learning models in identifying ischemic stroke clot origins from histopathological images and emphasizes the need for refined modeling techniques specifically adapted to thrombi WSI. Further research is needed to improve model performance, interpretability, validate its effectiveness. Future enhancement could include integrating larger patient cohorts, advanced preprocessing strategies, and exploring ensemble multimodal methods for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present EchoScene, an interactive and controllable generative model that generates 3D indoor scenes on scene graphs. EchoScene leverages a dual-branch diffusion model that dynamically adapts to scene graphs. Existing methods struggle to handle scene graphs due to varying numbers of nodes, multiple edge combinations, and manipulator-induced node-edge operations. EchoScene overcomes this by associating each node with a denoising process and enables collaborative information exchange, enhancing controllable and consistent generation aware of global constraints. This is achieved through an information echo scheme in both shape and layout branches. At every denoising step, all processes share their denoising data with an information exchange unit that combines these updates using graph convolution. The scheme ensures that the denoising processes are influenced by a holistic understanding of the scene graph, facilitating the generation of globally coherent scenes. The resulting scenes can be manipulated during inference by editing the input scene graph and sampling the noise in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate our approach, which maintains scene controllability and surpasses previous methods in generation fidelity. Moreover, the generated scenes are of high quality and thus directly compatible with off-the-shelf texture generation. Code and trained models are open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojun Xiong, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) play a central role in modeling sequential decision making problems under an instantaneous activation constraint that at most B arms can be activated at any decision epoch. Each restless arm is endowed with a state that evolves independently according to a Markov decision process regardless of being activated or not. In this paper, we consider the task of learning in episodic RMAB with unknown transition functions and adversarial rewards, which can change arbitrarily across episodes. Further, we consider a challenging but natural bandit feedback setting that only adversarial rewards of activated arms are revealed to the decision maker (DM). The goal of the DM is to maximize its total adversarial rewards during the learning process while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied in each decision epoch. We develop a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with two key contributors: a novel biased adversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback and unknown transitions, and a low-complexity index policy to satisfy the instantaneous activation constraint. We show $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for our algorithm, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the episode length. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for adversarial RMAB in our considered challenging settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghe Zheng, Hongzhi Wang, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate excellent performance on graphs, with their core idea about aggregating neighborhood information and learning from labels. However, the prevailing challenges in most graph datasets are twofold of Insufficient High-Quality Labels and Lack of Neighborhoods, resulting in weak GNNs. Existing data augmentation methods designed to address these two issues often tackle only one. They may either require extensive training of generators, rely on overly simplistic strategies, or demand substantial prior knowledge, leading to suboptimal generalization abilities. To simultaneously address both of these two challenges, we propose an elegant method called IntraMix. IntraMix innovatively employs Mixup among low-quality labeled data of the same class, generating high-quality labeled data at minimal cost. Additionally, it establishes neighborhoods for the generated data by connecting them with data from the same class with high confidence, thereby enriching the neighborhoods of graphs. IntraMix efficiently tackles both challenges faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix serves as a universal framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Li, Fei Tao, Wei Ye, Aydin Nassehi, John W. Sutherland</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce Generative Manufacturing Systems (GMS) as a novel approach to effectively manage and coordinate autonomous manufacturing assets, thereby enhancing their responsiveness and flexibility to address a wide array of production objectives and human preferences. Deviating from traditional explicit modeling, GMS employs generative AI, including diffusion models and ChatGPT, for implicit learning from envisioned futures, marking a shift from a model-optimum to a training-sampling decision-making. Through the integration of generative AI, GMS enables complex decision-making through interactive dialogue with humans, allowing manufacturing assets to generate multiple high-quality global decisions that can be iteratively refined based on human feedback. Empirical findings showcase GMS's substantial improvement in system resilience and responsiveness to uncertainties, with decision times reduced from seconds to milliseconds. The study underscores the inherent creativity and diversity in the generated solutions, facilitating human-centric decision-making through seamless and continuous human-machine interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Palmeira Ferraz</p>
<p>Abstract: Whisper is a multitask and multilingual speech model covering 99 languages. It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we examine its limitations, demonstrating the presence of speaker-related (gender, age) and model-related (resourcefulness and model size) bias. Despite that, we show that only model-related bias are amplified by quantization, impacting more low-resource languages and smaller models. Searching for a better compression approach, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach that is able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jionghao Lin, Zifei Han, Danielle R. Thomas, Ashish Gurung, Shivang Gupta, Vincent Aleven, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: One-on-one tutoring is widely acknowledged as an effective instructional method, conditioned on qualified tutors. However, the high demand for qualified tutors remains a challenge, often necessitating the training of novice tutors (i.e., trainees) to ensure effective tutoring. Research suggests that providing timely explanatory feedback can facilitate the training process for trainees. However, it presents challenges due to the time-consuming nature of assessing trainee performance by human experts. Inspired by the recent advancements of large language models (LLMs), our study employed the GPT-4 model to build an explanatory feedback system. This system identifies trainees' responses in binary form (i.e., correct/incorrect) and automatically provides template-based feedback with responses appropriately rephrased by the GPT-4 model. We conducted our study on 410 responses from trainees across three training lessons: Giving Effective Praise, Reacting to Errors, and Determining What Students Know. Our findings indicate that: 1) using a few-shot approach, the GPT-4 model effectively identifies correct/incorrect trainees' responses from three training lessons with an average F1 score of 0.84 and an AUC score of 0.85; and 2) using the few-shot approach, the GPT-4 model adeptly rephrases incorrect trainees' responses into desired responses, achieving performance comparable to that of human experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, but they often lack the ability to access and reason over domain-specific knowledge and tools. In this paper, we introduced CACTUS (Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science), an LLM-based agent that integrates cheminformatics tools to enable advanced reasoning and problem-solving in chemistry and molecular discovery. We evaluate the performance of CACTUS using a diverse set of open-source LLMs, including Gemma-7b, Falcon-7b, MPT-7b, Llama2-7b, and Mistral-7b, on a benchmark of thousands of chemistry questions. Our results demonstrate that CACTUS significantly outperforms baseline LLMs, with the Gemma-7b and Mistral-7b models achieving the highest accuracy regardless of the prompting strategy used. Moreover, we explore the impact of domain-specific prompting and hardware configurations on model performance, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering and the potential for deploying smaller models on consumer-grade hardware without significant loss in accuracy. By combining the cognitive capabilities of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS can assist researchers in tasks such as molecular property prediction, similarity searching, and drug-likeness assessment. Furthermore, CACTUS represents a significant milestone in the field of cheminformatics, offering an adaptable tool for researchers engaged in chemistry and molecular discovery. By integrating the strengths of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS has the potential to accelerate scientific advancement and unlock new frontiers in the exploration of novel, effective, and safe therapeutic candidates, catalysts, and materials. Moreover, CACTUS's ability to integrate with automated experimentation platforms and make data-driven decisions in real time opens up new possibilities for autonomous discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicong Wang, Kuo Gai, Shihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural collapse (NC) is a simple and symmetric phenomenon for deep neural networks (DNNs) at the terminal phase of training, where the last-layer features collapse to their class means and form a simplex equiangular tight frame aligning with the classifier vectors. However, the relationship of the last-layer features to the data and intermediate layers during training remains unexplored. To this end, we characterize the geometry of intermediate layers of ResNet and propose a novel conjecture, progressive feedforward collapse (PFC), claiming the degree of collapse increases during the forward propagation of DNNs. We derive a transparent model for the well-trained ResNet according to that ResNet with weight decay approximates the geodesic curve in Wasserstein space at the terminal phase. The metrics of PFC indeed monotonically decrease across depth on various datasets. We propose a new surrogate model, multilayer unconstrained feature model (MUFM), connecting intermediate layers by an optimal transport regularizer. The optimal solution of MUFM is inconsistent with NC but is more concentrated relative to the input data. Overall, this study extends NC to PFC to model the collapse phenomenon of intermediate layers and its dependence on the input data, shedding light on the theoretical understanding of ResNet in classification problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Chakravarty</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent transformer-based ASR models have achieved word-error rates (WER) below 4%, surpassing human annotator accuracy, yet they demand extensive server resources, contributing to significant carbon footprints. The traditional server-based architecture of ASR also presents privacy concerns, alongside reliability and latency issues due to network dependencies. In contrast, on-device (edge) ASR enhances privacy, boosts performance, and promotes sustainability by effectively balancing energy use and accuracy for specific applications. This study examines the effects of quantization, memory demands, and energy consumption on the performance of various ASR model inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. By analyzing WER and transcription speed across models using FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization on clean and noisy datasets, we highlight the crucial trade-offs between accuracy, speeds, quantization, energy efficiency, and memory needs. We found that changing precision from fp32 to fp16 halves the energy consumption for audio transcription across different models, with minimal performance degradation. A larger model size and number of parameters neither guarantees better resilience to noise, nor predicts the energy consumption for a given transcription load. These, along with several other findings offer novel insights for optimizing ASR systems within energy- and memory-limited environments, crucial for the development of efficient on-device ASR solutions.

In practical settings, access to predictions may be reduced to specific instances, due to cost or data limitations. Our investigation focuses on scenarios where predictions for only $B$ job sizes out of $n$ are available to the algorithm. We first establish near-optimal lower bounds and algorithms in the case of perfect predictions. Subsequently, we present a learning-augmented algorithm satisfying the robustness, consistency, and smoothness criteria, and revealing a novel tradeoff between consistency and smoothness inherent in the scenario with a restricted number of predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Giseop Kim, Sunwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Bird's Eye View (BEV) fusion for map construction have demonstrated remarkable mapping of urban environments. However, their deep and bulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and computing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in constructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause significant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing latency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most existing methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the precise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As the imprecision leads to risky self-driving, the diverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address the issue with our novel Trumpet Neural Network (TNN) mechanism. The framework utilizes LR BEV space and outputs an up-sampled semantic BEV map to create a memory-efficient pipeline. To this end, we introduce Local Restoration of BEV representation. Specifically, the up-sampled BEV representation has severely aliased, blocky signals, and thick semantic labels. Our proposed Local Restoration restores the signals and thins (or narrows down) the width of the labels. Our extensive experiments show that the TNN mechanism provides a plug-and-play memory-efficient pipeline, thereby enabling the effective estimation of real-sized (or precise) semantic labels for BEV map construction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although pre-trained language models have exhibited great flexibility and versatility with prompt-based few-shot learning, they suffer from the extensive parameter size and limited applicability for inference. Recent studies have suggested that PLMs be used as dataset generators and a tiny task-specific model be trained to achieve efficient inference. However, their applicability to various domains is limited because they tend to generate domain-specific datasets. In this work, we propose a novel approach to universal domain generalization that generates a dataset regardless of the target domain. This allows for generalization of the tiny task model to any domain that shares the label space, thus enhancing the real-world applicability of the dataset generation paradigm. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method accomplishes generalizability across various domains while using a parameter set that is orders of magnitude smaller than PLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: In various real-world scenarios, interactions among agents often resemble the dynamics of general-sum games, where each agent strives to optimize its own utility. Despite the ubiquitous relevance of such settings, decentralized machine learning algorithms have struggled to find equilibria that maximize individual utility while preserving social welfare. In this paper we introduce Learning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), a novel, decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm tailored to optimizing an agent's individual utility while fostering cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive environments. LOQA assumes the opponent samples actions proportionally to their action-value function Q. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LOQA at achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmark scenarios such as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and the Coin Game. LOQA achieves these outcomes with a significantly reduced computational footprint, making it a promising approach for practical multi-agent applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Wang, Wenwen Qiang, Changwen Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of generality in machine learning is to achieve excellent performance on various unseen tasks and domains. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been regarded as an effective method to achieve this goal. It can learn high-quality representations from unlabeled data and achieve promising empirical performance on multiple downstream tasks. Existing SSL methods mainly constrain generality from two aspects: (i) large-scale training data, and (ii) learning task-level shared knowledge. However, these methods lack explicit modeling of the SSL generality in the learning objective, and the theoretical understanding of SSL's generality remains limited. This may cause SSL models to overfit in data-scarce situations and generalize poorly in the real world, making it difficult to achieve true generality. To address these issues, we provide a theoretical definition of generality in SSL and define a $\sigma$-measurement to help quantify it. Based on this insight, we explicitly model generality into self-supervised learning and further propose a novel SSL framework, called GeSSL. It introduces a self-motivated target based on $\sigma$-measurement, which enables the model to find the optimal update direction towards generality. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GeSSL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Huang, Yongqi Dong, Youhua Tang, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalation in urban private car ownership has worsened the urban parking predicament, necessitating effective parking availability prediction for urban planning and management. However, the existing prediction methods suffer from low prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features related to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations between similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges, this study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating spatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing traffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services), and parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the spatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with different machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models for predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in terms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source demanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach offers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that furnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban planners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Lei, Brian N. Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating soil reflectance spectra is invaluable for soil-plant radiative modeling and training machine learning models, yet it is difficult as the intricate relationships between soil structure and its constituents. To address this, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra based on soil property inputs was developed. The model is trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property pairs from 17 datasets. It generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format. The generative model can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties. SOGM is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the full visible-near-infrared range (VIS-NIR; 400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM. The SOGM was up-scaled by coupling with the Helios 3D plant modeling software, which allowed for generation of synthetic aerial images of simulated soil and plant scenes. It can also be easily integrated with soil-plant radiation model used for remote sensin research like PROSAIL. The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets that not included in model training proved that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs. The presented models are openly accessible on: https://github.com/GEMINI-Breeding/SOGM_soil_spectra_simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing a hand mesh from a single RGB image is a challenging task because hands are often occluded by objects. Most previous works attempted to introduce more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms to improve 3D reconstruction results, but it would increased computational complexity. This observation prompts us to propose a new and concise architecture while improving computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a simple and effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network HandSSCA, which is the first to incorporate state space modeling into the field of hand pose estimation. In the network, we have designed a novel state space channel attention module that extends the effective sensory field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances hand regional features in the channel dimension. This design helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets featuring challenging hand-object occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandSSCA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameter count.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm, enabling parties to collaboratively train models while keeping their data confidential. Within autonomous driving, it brings the potential of reducing data storage costs, reducing bandwidth requirements, and to accelerate the learning. FL is, however, susceptible to poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce two novel poisoning attacks on FL tailored to regression tasks within autonomous driving: FLStealth and Off-Track Attack (OTA). FLStealth, an untargeted attack, aims at providing model updates that deteriorate the global model performance while appearing benign. OTA, on the other hand, is a targeted attack with the objective to change the global model's behavior when exposed to a certain trigger. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by conducting comprehensive experiments pertaining to the task of vehicle trajectory prediction. In particular, we show that, among five different untargeted attacks, FLStealth is the most successful at bypassing the considered defenses employed by the server. For OTA, we demonstrate the inability of common defense strategies to mitigate the attack, highlighting the critical need for new defensive mechanisms against targeted attacks within FL for autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Transformer, due to its global attention mechanism, has emerged as a new tool in dealing with graph-structured data. It is well recognized that the global attention mechanism considers a wider receptive field in a fully connected graph, leading many to believe that useful information can be extracted from all the nodes. In this paper, we challenge this belief: does the globalizing property always benefit Graph Transformers? We reveal the over-globalizing problem in Graph Transformer by presenting both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, i.e., the current attention mechanism overly focuses on those distant nodes, while the near nodes, which actually contain most of the useful information, are relatively weakened. Then we propose a novel Bi-Level Global Graph Transformer with Collaborative Training (CoBFormer), including the inter-cluster and intra-cluster Transformers, to prevent the over-globalizing problem while keeping the ability to extract valuable information from distant nodes. Moreover, the collaborative training is proposed to improve the model's generalization ability with a theoretical guarantee. Extensive experiments on various graphs well validate the effectiveness of our proposed CoBFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Khalil, Tizian Dege, Pegah Golchin, Rostyslav Olshevskyi, Antonio Fernandez Anta, Tobias Meuser</p>
<p>Abstract: In the pursuit of refining precise perception models for fully autonomous driving, continual online model training becomes essential. Federated Learning (FL) within vehicular networks offers an efficient mechanism for model training while preserving raw sensory data integrity. Yet, FL struggles with non-identically distributed data (e.g., quantity skew), leading to suboptimal convergence rates during model training. In previous work, we introduced FedLA, an innovative Label-Aware aggregation method addressing data heterogeneity in FL for generic scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce FedProx+LA, a novel FL method building upon the state-of-the-art FedProx and FedLA to tackle data heterogeneity, which is specifically tailored for vehicular networks. We evaluate the efficacy of FedProx+LA in continuous online object detection model training. Through a comparative analysis against conventional and state-of-the-art methods, our findings reveal the superior convergence rate of FedProx+LA. Notably, if the label distribution is very heterogeneous, our FedProx+LA approach shows substantial improvements in detection performance compared to baseline methods, also outperforming our previous FedLA approach. Moreover, both FedLA and FedProx+LA increase convergence speed by 30% compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungyeop Lee, Knut Peterson, Solmaz Arezoomandan, Bill Cai, Peihan Li, Lifeng Zhou, David Han</p>
<p>Abstract: A major obstacle to the development of effective monocular depth estimation algorithms is the difficulty in obtaining high-quality depth data that corresponds to collected RGB images. Collecting this data is time-consuming and costly, and even data collected by modern sensors has limited range or resolution, and is subject to inconsistencies and noise. To combat this, we propose a method of data generation in simulation using 3D synthetic environments and CycleGAN domain transfer. We compare this method of data generation to the popular NYUDepth V2 dataset by training a depth estimation model based on the DenseDepth structure using different training sets of real and simulated data. We evaluate the performance of the models on newly collected images and LiDAR depth data from a Husky robot to verify the generalizability of the approach and show that GAN-transformed data can serve as an effective alternative to real-world data, particularly in depth estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lotem Golany, Filippo Galgani, Maya Mamo, Nimrod Parasol, Omer Vandsburger, Nadav Bar, Ido Dagan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for creating source-grounded information-seeking dialog datasets are often costly and hard to implement due to their sole reliance on human annotators. We propose combining large language models (LLMs) prompting with human expertise for more efficient and reliable data generation. Instead of the labor-intensive Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) method, where two annotators generate a dialog from scratch, role-playing agent and user, we use LLM generation to simulate the two roles. Annotators then verify the output and augment it with attribution data. We demonstrate our method by constructing MISeD -- Meeting Information Seeking Dialogs dataset -- the first information-seeking dialog dataset focused on meeting transcripts. Models finetuned with MISeD demonstrate superior performance on our test set, as well as on a novel fully-manual WOZ test set and an existing query-based summarization benchmark, suggesting the utility of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to autonomously assemble structures is crucial for the development of future space infrastructure. However, the unpredictable conditions of space pose significant challenges for robotic systems, necessitating the development of advanced learning techniques to enable autonomous assembly. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning autonomous peg-in-hole assembly in the context of space robotics. Our focus is on enhancing the generalization and adaptability of autonomous systems through deep reinforcement learning. By integrating procedural generation and domain randomization, we train agents in a highly parallelized simulation environment across a spectrum of diverse scenarios with the aim of acquiring a robust policy. The proposed approach is evaluated using three distinct reinforcement learning algorithms to investigate the trade-offs among various paradigms. We demonstrate the adaptability of our agents to novel scenarios and assembly sequences while emphasizing the potential of leveraging advanced simulation techniques for robot learning in space. Our findings set the stage for future advancements in intelligent robotic systems capable of supporting ambitious space missions and infrastructure development beyond Earth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xerxes D. Arsiwalla</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores the hypothesis that subjectively attributed meaning constitutes the phenomenal content of conscious experience. That is, phenomenal content is semantic. This form of subjective meaning manifests as an intrinsic and non-representational character of qualia. Empirically, subjective meaning is ubiquitous in conscious experiences. We point to phenomenological studies that lend evidence to support this. Furthermore, this notion of meaning closely relates to what Frege refers to as "sense", in metaphysics and philosophy of language. It also aligns with Peirce's "interpretant", in semiotics. We discuss how Frege's sense can also be extended to the raw feels of consciousness. Sense and reference both play a role in phenomenal experience. Moreover, within the context of the mind-matter relation, we provide a formalization of subjective meaning associated to one's mental representations. Identifying the precise maps between the physical and mental domains, we argue that syntactic and semantic structures transcend language, and are realized within each of these domains. Formally, meaning is a relational attribute, realized via a map that interprets syntactic structures of a formal system within an appropriate semantic space. The image of this map within the mental domain is what is relevant for experience, and thus comprises the phenomenal content of qualia. We conclude with possible implications this may have for experience-based theories of consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saahil Islam, Venkatesh N. Murthy, Dominik Neumann, Badhan Kumar Das, Puneet Sharma, Andreas Maier, Dorin Comaniciu, Florin C. Ghesu</p>
<p>Abstract: An accurate detection and tracking of devices such as guiding catheters in live X-ray image acquisitions is an essential prerequisite for endovascular cardiac interventions. This information is leveraged for procedural guidance, e.g., directing stent placements. To ensure procedural safety and efficacy, there is a need for high robustness no failures during tracking. To achieve that, one needs to efficiently tackle challenges, such as: device obscuration by contrast agent or other external devices or wires, changes in field-of-view or acquisition angle, as well as the continuous movement due to cardiac and respiratory motion. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel approach to learn spatio-temporal features from a very large data cohort of over 16 million interventional X-ray frames using self-supervision for image sequence data. Our approach is based on a masked image modeling technique that leverages frame interpolation based reconstruction to learn fine inter-frame temporal correspondences. The features encoded in the resulting model are fine-tuned downstream. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and in particular robustness compared to ultra optimized reference solutions (that use multi-stage feature fusion, multi-task and flow regularization). The experiments show that our method achieves 66.31% reduction in maximum tracking error against reference solutions (23.20% when flow regularization is used); achieving a success score of 97.95% at a 3x faster inference speed of 42 frames-per-second (on GPU). The results encourage the use of our approach in various other tasks within interventional image analytics that require effective understanding of spatio-temporal semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Frizzo, Francesco Borsatti, Alessio Arcudi, Antonio De Moliner, Roberto Oboe, Gian Antonio Susto</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial process often required in industrial settings. Anomalies can signal underlying issues within a system, prompting further investigation. Industrial processes aim to streamline operations as much as possible, encompassing the production of the final product, making AD an essential mean to reach this goal.Conventional anomaly detection methodologies typically classify observations as either normal or anomalous without providing insight into the reasons behind these classifications.Consequently, in light of the emergence of Industry 5.0, a more desirable approach involves providing interpretable outcomes, enabling users to understand the rationale behind the results.This paper presents the first industrial application of ExIFFI, a recently developed approach focused on the production of fast and efficient explanations for the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) Anomaly detection method. ExIFFI is tested on two publicly available industrial datasets demonstrating superior effectiveness in explanations and computational efficiency with the respect to other state-of-the-art explainable AD models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijia Wang, Wenbin Yang, Zhisong Liu, Zhen Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-training is a powerful approach to deep learning. The key process is to find a pseudo-label for modeling. However, previous self-training algorithms suffer from the over-confidence issue brought by the hard labels, even some confidence-related regularizers cannot comprehensively catch the uncertainty. Therefore, we propose a new self-training framework to combine uncertainty information of both model and dataset. Specifically, we propose to use Expectation-Maximization (EM) to smooth the labels and comprehensively estimate the uncertainty information. We further design a basis extraction network to estimate the initial basis from the dataset. The obtained basis with uncertainty can be filtered based on uncertainty information. It can then be transformed into the real hard label to iteratively update the model and basis in the retraining process. Experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation show the advantages of our methods among confidence-aware self-training algorithms with 1-3 percentage improvement on different datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) from noisy labels is an important and challenging task. However, most existing approaches focus on the corrupted labels and ignore the importance of inherent data structure. To bridge the gap between noisy labels and data, inspired by the concept of potential energy in physics, we propose a novel Potential Energy based Mixture Model (PEMM) for noise-labels learning. We innovate a distance-based classifier with the potential energy regularization on its class centers. Embedding our proposed classifier with existing deep learning backbones, we can have robust networks with better feature representations. They can preserve intrinsic structures from the data, resulting in a superior noisy tolerance. We conducted extensive experiments to analyze the efficiency of our proposed model on several real-world datasets. Quantitative results show that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Xing Tian, Yibing Liu, Haoliang Li, Ray C. C. Cheung, Shiqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge computing allows artificial intelligence and machine learning models to be deployed on edge devices, where they can learn from local data and collaborate to form a global model. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that facilitates this process while preserving data privacy. However, FL also faces challenges such as high computational and communication costs regarding resource-constrained devices, and poor generalization performance due to the heterogeneity of data across edge clients and the presence of out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we propose the Gradient-Congruity Guided Federated Sparse Training (FedSGC), a novel method that integrates dynamic sparse training and gradient congruity inspection into federated learning framework to address these issues. Our method leverages the idea that the neurons, in which the associated gradients with conflicting directions with respect to the global model contain irrelevant or less generalized information for other clients, and could be pruned during the sparse training process. Conversely, the neurons where the associated gradients with consistent directions could be grown in a higher priority. In this way, FedSGC can greatly reduce the local computation and communication overheads while, at the same time, enhancing the generalization abilities of FL. We evaluate our method on challenging non-i.i.d settings and show that it achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across various scenarios while minimizing computation and communication costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Finn Rietz, Erik Schaffernicht, Stefan Heinrich, Johannes A. Stork</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning policies are typically represented by black-box neural networks, which are non-interpretable and not well-suited for safety-critical domains. To address both of these issues, we propose constrained normalizing flow policies as interpretable and safe-by-construction policy models. We achieve safety for reinforcement learning problems with instantaneous safety constraints, for which we can exploit domain knowledge by analytically constructing a normalizing flow that ensures constraint satisfaction. The normalizing flow corresponds to an interpretable sequence of transformations on action samples, each ensuring alignment with respect to a particular constraint. Our experiments reveal benefits beyond interpretability in an easier learning objective and maintained constraint satisfaction throughout the entire learning process. Our approach leverages constraints over reward engineering while offering enhanced interpretability, safety, and direct means of providing domain knowledge to the agent without relying on complex reward functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhou, Xiahao Zou, Yi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bone segmentation is an essential step for the preoperative planning of fracture trauma surgery. The automated segmentation of fractured bone from computed tomography (CT) scans remains challenging, due to the large differences of fractures in position and morphology, and also the inherent anatomical characteristics of different bone structures. To alleviate these issues, we propose a cross-scale attention mechanism as well as a surface supervision strategy for fractured bone segmentation in CT. Specifically, a cross-scale attention mechanism is introduced to effectively aggregate the features among different scales to provide more powerful fracture representation. Moreover, a surface supervision strategy is employed, which explicitly constrains the network to pay more attention to the bone boundary. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated on a public dataset containing CT scans with hip fractures. The evaluation metrics are Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Hausdorff distance (95HD). The proposed method achieves an average DSC of 93.36%, ASSD of 0.85mm, 95HD of 7.51mm. Our method offers an effective fracture segmentation approach for the pelvic CT examinations, and has the potential to be used for improving the segmentation performance of other types of fractures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Sun, Mingxiao Li, Jingyuan Sun, Jesse Davis, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Argument structure learning~(ASL) entails predicting relations between arguments. Because it can structure a document to facilitate its understanding, it has been widely applied in many fields~(medical, commercial, and scientific domains). Despite its broad utilization, ASL remains a challenging task because it involves examining the complex relationships between the sentences in a potentially unstructured discourse. To resolve this problem, we have developed a simple yet effective approach called Dual-tower Multi-scale cOnvolution neural Network~(DMON) for the ASL task. Specifically, we organize arguments into a relationship matrix that together with the argument embeddings forms a relationship tensor and design a mechanism to capture relations with contextual arguments. Experimental results on three different-domain argument mining datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably the well-documented \textit{jailbreak} attack. Recently, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack has demonstrated efficacy in exploiting this vulnerability by optimizing adversarial prompts through a combination of gradient heuristics and greedy search. However, the efficiency of this attack has become a bottleneck in the attacking process. To mitigate this limitation, in this paper we rethink the generation of adversarial prompts through an optimization lens, aiming to stabilize the optimization process and harness more heuristic insights from previous iterations. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{M}omentum \textbf{A}ccelerated G\textbf{C}G (\textbf{MAC}) attack, which incorporates a momentum term into the gradient heuristic. Experimental results showcase the notable enhancement achieved by MAP in gradient-based attacks on aligned language models.

<p>Abstract: We propose TRAMBA, a hybrid transformer and Mamba architecture for acoustic and bone conduction speech enhancement, suitable for mobile and wearable platforms. Bone conduction speech enhancement has been impractical to adopt in mobile and wearable platforms for several reasons: (i) data collection is labor-intensive, resulting in scarcity; (ii) there exists a performance gap between state of-art models with memory footprints of hundreds of MBs and methods better suited for resource-constrained systems. To adapt TRAMBA to vibration-based sensing modalities, we pre-train TRAMBA with audio speech datasets that are widely available. Then, users fine-tune with a small amount of bone conduction data. TRAMBA outperforms state-of-art GANs by up to 7.3% in PESQ and 1.8% in STOI, with an order of magnitude smaller memory footprint and an inference speed up of up to 465 times. We integrate TRAMBA into real systems and show that TRAMBA (i) improves battery life of wearables by up to 160% by requiring less data sampling and transmission; (ii) generates higher quality voice in noisy environments than over-the-air speech; (iii) requires a memory footprint of less than 20.0 MB.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a trajectory prediction model tailored for autonomous driving, focusing on capturing complex interactions in dynamic traffic scenarios without reliance on high-definition maps. The model, termed MFTraj, harnesses historical trajectory data combined with a novel dynamic geometric graph-based behavior-aware module. At its core, an adaptive structure-aware interactive graph convolutional network captures both positional and behavioral features of road users, preserving spatial-temporal intricacies. Enhanced by a linear attention mechanism, the model achieves computational efficiency and reduced parameter overhead. Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models. The results and methodology suggest a significant advancement in autonomous driving trajectory prediction, paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that existing Face Recognition Systems (FRS), including commercial ones, often exhibit biases toward certain ethnicities due to under-represented data. In this work, we explore ethnicity alteration and skin tone modification using synthetic face image generation methods to increase the diversity of datasets. We conduct a detailed analysis by first constructing a balanced face image dataset representing three ethnicities: Asian, Black, and Indian. We then make use of existing Generative Adversarial Network-based (GAN) image-to-image translation and manifold learning models to alter the ethnicity from one to another. A systematic analysis is further conducted to assess the suitability of such datasets for FRS by studying the realistic skin-tone representation using Individual Typology Angle (ITA). Further, we also analyze the quality characteristics using existing Face image quality assessment (FIQA) approaches. We then provide a holistic FRS performance analysis using four different systems. Our findings pave the way for future research works in (i) developing both specific ethnicity and general (any to any) ethnicity alteration models, (ii) expanding such approaches to create databases with diverse skin tones, (iii) creating datasets representing various ethnicities which further can help in mitigating bias while addressing privacy concerns.</p>

A multi-task fine-tuning approach is adopted for language model (LM) shallow fusion. The experiments yielded an improvement in DID accuracy of 10.8% relative to a baseline ECAPA-TDNN, and WER performance approaching the TDNN-HMM model.

Recent studies focus on exploring their capabilities for data annotation. This paper provides a comparative overview of twelve studies investigating the potential of LLMs in labelling data. While the models demonstrate promising cost and time-saving benefits, there exist considerable limitations, such as representativeness, bias, sensitivity to prompt variations and English language preference. Leveraging insights from these studies, our empirical analysis further examines the alignment between human and GPT-generated opinion distributions across four subjective datasets. In contrast to the studies examining representation, our methodology directly obtains the opinion distribution from GPT. Our analysis thereby supports the minority of studies that are considering diverse perspectives when evaluating data annotation tasks and highlights the need for further research in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madison Cotteret, Hugh Greatorex, Alpha Renner, Junren Chen, Emre Neftci, Huaqiang Wu, Giacomo Indiveri, Martin Ziegler, Elisabetta Chicca</p>
<p>Abstract: Programming recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) to robustly perform multi-timescale computation remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we show how the distributed approach offered by vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), which uses high-dimensional random vectors as the smallest units of representation, can be leveraged to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms. The transition terms are formed by the VSA binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly non-ideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of VSA representations for embedding robust computation with recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. This advances VSAs as a high-level representation-invariant abstract language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Maranto</p>
<p>Abstract: As spacecraft journey further from Earth with more complex missions, systems of greater autonomy and onboard intelligence are called for. Reducing reliance on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base, enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft. This research evaluates the potential of LLMs in augmenting autonomous decision-making systems for future robotic space applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tifanny Portela, Gabriel B. Margolis, Yandong Ji, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling contact forces during interactions is critical for locomotion and manipulation tasks. While sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) has succeeded in many contact-rich problems, current RL methods achieve forceful interactions implicitly without explicitly regulating forces. We propose a method for training RL policies for direct force control without requiring access to force sensing. We showcase our method on a whole-body control platform of a quadruped robot with an arm. Such force control enables us to perform gravity compensation and impedance control, unlocking compliant whole-body manipulation. The learned whole-body controller with variable compliance makes it intuitive for humans to teleoperate the robot by only commanding the manipulator, and the robot's body adjusts automatically to achieve the desired position and force. Consequently, a human teleoperator can easily demonstrate a wide variety of loco-manipulation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first deployment of learned whole-body force control in legged manipulators, paving the way for more versatile and adaptable legged robots.</p>

<p>Abstract: The design of dialogue flows is a critical but time-consuming task when developing task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. We propose an approach for the unsupervised discovery of flows from dialogue history, thus making the process applicable to any domain for which such an history is available. Briefly, utterances are represented in a vector space and clustered according to their semantic similarity. Clusters, which can be seen as dialogue states, are then used as the vertices of a transition graph for representing the flows visually. We present concrete examples of flows, discovered from MultiWOZ, a public TOD dataset. We further elaborate on their significance and relevance for the underlying conversations and introduce an automatic validation metric for their assessment. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for extracting meaningful flows from task-oriented conversations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a pivotal role in cardiology for diagnostic and interventional procedures. However, using it effectively requires extensive training due to the intricate nature of image acquisition and interpretation. To enhance the efficiency of novice sonographers and reduce variability in scan acquisitions, we propose a novel ultrasound (US) navigation assistance method based on contrastive learning as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). We augment the previous framework using a novel contrastive patient batching method (CPB) and a data-augmented contrastive loss, both of which we demonstrate are essential to ensure generalization to anatomical variations across patients. The proposed framework enables navigation to both standard diagnostic as well as intricate interventional views with a single model. Our method was developed with a large dataset of 789 patients and obtained an average error of 6.56 mm in position and 9.36 degrees in angle on a testing dataset of 140 patients, which is competitive or superior to models trained on individual views. Furthermore, we quantitatively validate our method's ability to navigate to interventional views such as the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) view used in LAA closure. Our approach holds promise in providing valuable guidance during transesophageal ultrasound examinations, contributing to the advancement of skill acquisition for cardiac ultrasound practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tang, Xu Han, Xianzhi Li, Qiao Yu, Yixue Hao, Long Hu, Min Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large 2D vision-language models (2D-LLMs) have gained significant attention by bridging Large Language Models (LLMs) with images using a simple projector. Inspired by their success, large 3D point cloud-language models (3D-LLMs) also integrate point clouds into LLMs. However, directly aligning point clouds with LLM requires expensive training costs, typically in hundreds of GPU-hours on A100, which hinders the development of 3D-LLMs. In this paper, we introduce MiniGPT-3D, an efficient and powerful 3D-LLM that achieves multiple SOTA results while training for only 27 hours on one RTX 3090. Specifically, we propose to align 3D point clouds with LLMs using 2D priors from 2D-LLMs, which can leverage the similarity between 2D and 3D visual information. We introduce a novel four-stage training strategy for modality alignment in a cascaded way, and a mixture of query experts module to adaptively aggregate features with high efficiency. Moreover, we utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods LoRA and Norm fine-tuning, resulting in only 47.8M learnable parameters, which is up to 260x fewer than existing methods. Extensive experiments show that MiniGPT-3D achieves SOTA on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, with significantly cheaper training costs. Notably, MiniGPT-3D gains an 8.12 increase on GPT-4 evaluation score for the challenging object captioning task compared to ShapeLLM-13B, while the latter costs 160 total GPU-hours on 8 A800. We are the first to explore the efficient 3D-LLM, offering new insights to the community. Code and weights are available at https://github.com/TangYuan96/MiniGPT-3D.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the generation of hardware description code, aiming to explore their potential in supporting and enhancing the development of efficient neuromorphic computing architectures. Building on our prior work, we employ OpenAI's ChatGPT4 and natural language prompts to synthesize a RTL Verilog module of a programmable recurrent spiking neural network, while also generating test benches to assess the system's correctness. The resultant design was validated in three case studies, the exclusive OR,the IRIS flower classification and the MNIST hand-written digit classification, achieving accuracies of up to 96.6%. To verify its synthesizability and implementability, the design was prototyped on a field-programmable gate array and implemented on SkyWater 130 nm technology by using an open-source electronic design automation flow. Additionally, we have submitted it to Tiny Tapeout 6 chip fabrication program to further evaluate the system on-chip performance in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Abouelazm, Jonas Michel, J. Marius Zoellner</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as an important approach for autonomous driving. A reward function is used in reinforcement learning to establish the learned skill objectives and guide the agent toward the optimal policy. Since autonomous driving is a complex domain with partly conflicting objectives with varying degrees of priority, developing a suitable reward function represents a fundamental challenge. This paper aims to highlight the gap in such function design by assessing different proposed formulations in the literature and dividing individual objectives into Safety, Comfort, Progress, and Traffic Rules compliance categories. Additionally, the limitations of the reviewed reward functions are discussed, such as objectives aggregation and indifference to driving context. Furthermore, the reward categories are frequently inadequately formulated and lack standardization. This paper concludes by proposing future research that potentially addresses the observed shortcomings in rewards, including a reward validation framework and structured rewards that are context-aware and able to resolve conflicts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yu, Yufei Wang, Song Xia, Wenhan Yang, Shijian Lu, Yap-Peng Tan, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearnable examples (UEs) seek to maximize testing error by making subtle modifications to training examples that are correctly labeled. Defenses against these poisoning attacks can be categorized based on whether specific interventions are adopted during training. The first approach is training-time defense, such as adversarial training, which can mitigate poisoning effects but is computationally intensive. The other approach is pre-training purification, e.g., image short squeezing, which consists of several simple compressions but often encounters challenges in dealing with various UEs. Our work provides a novel disentanglement mechanism to build an efficient pre-training purification method. Firstly, we uncover rate-constrained variational autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrating a clear tendency to suppress the perturbations in UEs. We subsequently conduct a theoretical analysis for this phenomenon. Building upon these insights, we introduce a disentangle variational autoencoder (D-VAE), capable of disentangling the perturbations with learnable class-wise embeddings. Based on this network, a two-stage purification approach is naturally developed. The first stage focuses on roughly eliminating perturbations, while the second stage produces refined, poison-free results, ensuring effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a 100-class ImageNet-subset. Code is available at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/D-VAE.</p>

However, they often struggle on fine-trained datasets with categories not adequately represented during pre-training, which makes adaptation necessary. Recent works have shown promising results by utilizing samples from web-scale databases for retrieval-augmented adaptation, especially in low-data regimes. Despite the empirical success, understanding how retrieval impacts the adaptation of vision-language models remains an open research question. In this work, we adopt a reflective perspective by presenting a systematic study to understand the roles of key components in retrieval-augmented adaptation. We unveil new insights on uni-modal and cross-modal retrieval and highlight the critical role of logit ensemble for effective adaptation. We further present theoretical underpinnings that directly support our empirical observations.</p>

Our findings suggest that self-supervision allows patient-centric AI proving useful in clinical workflows and interpreting X-rays holistically.

<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot control policies, but these policies can suffer from distribution shift, where the conditions at evaluation time differ from those in the training data. A popular approach for increasing policy robustness to distribution shift is interactive imitation learning (i.e., DAgger and variants), where a human operator provides corrective interventions during policy rollouts. However, collecting a sufficient amount of interventions to cover the distribution of policy mistakes can be burdensome for human operators. We propose IntervenGen (I-Gen), a novel data generation system that can autonomously produce a large set of corrective interventions with rich coverage of the state space from a small number of human interventions. We apply I-Gen to 4 simulated environments and 1 physical environment with object pose estimation error and show that it can increase policy robustness by up to 39x with only 10 human interventions.

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in tasks requiring a fine-grained understanding of literal images and text, such as visual question-answering or visual entailment. However, there has been little exploration of these models' capabilities when presented with images and captions containing figurative phenomena such as metaphors or humor, the meaning of which is often implicit. To close this gap, we propose a new task and a high-quality dataset: Visual Figurative Language Understanding with Textual Explanations (V-FLUTE). We frame the visual figurative language understanding problem as an explainable visual entailment task, where the model has to predict whether the image (premise) entails a claim (hypothesis) and justify the predicted label with a textual explanation. Using a human-AI collaboration framework, we build a high-quality dataset, V-FLUTE, that contains 6,027 <image, claim, label, explanation> instances spanning five diverse multimodal figurative phenomena: metaphors, similes, idioms, sarcasm, and humor. The figurative phenomena can be present either in the image, the caption, or both. We further conduct both automatic and human evaluations to assess current VLMs' capabilities in understanding figurative phenomena.</p>

NeMo-Aligner comes with highly optimized and scalable implementations for major paradigms of model alignment such as: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SteerLM, and Self-Play Fine-Tuning (SPIN). Additionally, our toolkit supports running most of the alignment techniques in a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) setting. NeMo-Aligner is designed for extensibility, allowing support for other alignment techniques with minimal effort.

<p>Abstract: The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks. However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved. The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective. In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources. Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding. We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks. Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points. We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks. We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2. Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: While most research on controllable text generation has focused on steering base Language Models, the emerging instruction-tuning and prompting paradigm offers an alternate approach to controllability. We compile and release ConGenBench, a testbed of 17 different controllable generation tasks, using a subset of it to benchmark the performance of 9 different baselines and methods on Instruction-tuned Language Models. To our surprise, we find that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such research, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding the range of constraints that can be studied in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijing Jin, Yuen Chen, Fernando Gonzalez, Jiarui Liu, Jiayi Zhang, Julian Michael, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Mona Diab</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems. In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs? Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps. To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments. We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction. We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, safeguarding the intellectual property of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial. Current watermarking techniques against model extraction attacks, which rely on signal insertion in model logits or post-processing of generated text, remain largely heuristic. We propose a novel method for embedding learnable linguistic watermarks in LLMs, aimed at tracing and preventing model extraction attacks. Our approach subtly modifies the LLM's output distribution by introducing controlled noise into token frequency distributions, embedding an statistically identifiable controllable watermark.We leverage statistical hypothesis testing and information theory, particularly focusing on Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to differentiate between original and modified distributions effectively. Our watermarking method strikes a delicate well balance between robustness and output quality, maintaining low false positive/negative rates and preserving the LLM's original performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luciano Dyballa, Evan Gerritz, Steven W. Zucker</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization to unseen data remains poorly understood for deep learning classification and foundation models. How can one assess the ability of networks to adapt to new or extended versions of their input space in the spirit of few-shot learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and domain adaptation? Which layers of a network are likely to generalize best? We provide a new method for evaluating the capacity of networks to represent a sampled domain, regardless of whether the network has been trained on all classes in the domain. Our approach is the following: after fine-tuning state-of-the-art pre-trained models for visual classification on a particular domain, we assess their performance on data from related but distinct variations in that domain. Generalization power is quantified as a function of the latent embeddings of unseen data from intermediate layers for both unsupervised and supervised settings. Working throughout all stages of the network, we find that (i) high classification accuracy does not imply high generalizability; and (ii) deeper layers in a model do not always generalize the best, which has implications for pruning. Since the trends observed across datasets are largely consistent, we conclude that our approach reveals (a function of) the intrinsic capacity of the different layers of a model to generalize.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Luyu Gao, Barlas Oguz, Wenhan Xiong, Jimmy Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Xilun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and more detailed responses. Based on these observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-following capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishad Singhi, Jae Myung Kim, Karsten Roth, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) ground image classification on human-understandable concepts to allow for interpretable model decisions. Crucially, the CBM design inherently allows for human interventions, in which expert users are given the ability to modify potentially misaligned concept choices to influence the decision behavior of the model in an interpretable fashion. However, existing approaches often require numerous human interventions per image to achieve strong performances, posing practical challenges in scenarios where obtaining human feedback is expensive. In this paper, we find that this is noticeably driven by an independent treatment of concepts during intervention, wherein a change of one concept does not influence the use of other ones in the model's final decision. To address this issue, we introduce a trainable concept intervention realignment module, which leverages concept relations to realign concept assignments post-intervention. Across standard, real-world benchmarks, we find that concept realignment can significantly improve intervention efficacy; significantly reducing the number of interventions needed to reach a target classification performance or concept prediction accuracy. In addition, it easily integrates into existing concept-based architectures without requiring changes to the models themselves. This reduced cost of human-model collaboration is crucial to enhancing the feasibility of CBMs in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murtaza Dalal, Tarun Chiruvolu, Devendra Chaplot, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of performing high-level planning for long-horizon robotics tasks, yet existing methods require access to a pre-defined skill library (e.g. picking, placing, pulling, pushing, navigating). However, LLM planning does not address how to design or learn those behaviors, which remains challenging particularly in long-horizon settings. Furthermore, for many tasks of interest, the robot needs to be able to adjust its behavior in a fine-grained manner, requiring the agent to be capable of modifying low-level control actions. Can we instead use the internet-scale knowledge from LLMs for high-level policies, guiding reinforcement learning (RL) policies to efficiently solve robotic control tasks online without requiring a pre-determined set of skills? In this paper, we propose Plan-Seq-Learn (PSL): a modular approach that uses motion planning to bridge the gap between abstract language and learned low-level control for solving long-horizon robotics tasks from scratch. We demonstrate that PSL achieves state-of-the-art results on over 25 challenging robotics tasks with up to 10 stages. PSL solves long-horizon tasks from raw visual input spanning four benchmarks at success rates of over 85%, out-performing language-based, classical, and end-to-end approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Li, Jianyi Yang, Adam Wierman, Shaolei Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Fueled by the soaring popularity of large language and foundation models, the accelerated growth of artificial intelligence (AI) models' enormous environmental footprint has come under increased scrutiny. While many approaches have been proposed to make AI more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, environmental inequity -- the fact that AI's environmental footprint can be disproportionately higher in certain regions than in others -- has emerged, raising social-ecological justice concerns. This paper takes a first step toward addressing AI's environmental inequity by balancing its regional negative environmental impact. Concretely, we focus on the carbon and water footprints of AI model inference and propose equity-aware geographical load balancing (GLB) to explicitly address AI's environmental impacts on the most disadvantaged regions. We run trace-based simulations by considering a set of 10 geographically-distributed data centers that serve inference requests for a large language AI model. The results demonstrate that existing GLB approaches may amplify environmental inequity while our proposed equity-aware GLB can significantly reduce the regional disparity in terms of carbon and water footprints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Finn Rietz, Erik Schaffernicht, Stefan Heinrich, Johannes Andreas Stork</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for complex tasks remains a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties of engineering scalar reward functions and the inherent inefficiency of training models from scratch. Instead, it would be better to specify complex tasks in terms of elementary subtasks and to reuse subtask solutions whenever possible. In this work, we address continuous space lexicographic multi-objective RL problems, consisting of prioritized subtasks, which are notoriously difficult to solve. We show that these can be scalarized with a subtask transformation and then solved incrementally using value decomposition. Exploiting this insight, we propose prioritized soft Q-decomposition (PSQD), a novel algorithm for learning and adapting subtask solutions under lexicographic priorities in continuous state-action spaces. PSQD offers the ability to reuse previously learned subtask solutions in a zero-shot composition, followed by an adaptation step. Its ability to use retained subtask training data for offline learning eliminates the need for new environment interaction during adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting successful learning, reuse, and adaptation results for both low- and high-dimensional simulated robot control tasks, as well as offline learning results. In contrast to baseline approaches, PSQD does not trade off between conflicting subtasks or priority constraints and satisfies subtask priorities during learning. PSQD provides an intuitive framework for tackling complex RL problems, offering insights into the inner workings of the subtask composition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehua Pei, Hui-Ling Zhen, Mingxuan Yuan, Yu Huang, Bei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs), there is a need for automated circuit design methods. Recent years have seen rising research in hardware design language generation to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose a Verilog generation framework, BetterV, which fine-tunes the large language models (LLMs) on processed domain-specific datasets and incorporates generative discriminators for guidance on particular design demands. The Verilog modules are collected, filtered and processed from internet to form a clean and abundant dataset. Instruct-tuning methods are specially designed to fine-tune the LLMs to understand the knowledge about Verilog. Furthermore, data are augmented to enrich the training set and also used to train a generative discriminator on particular downstream task, which leads a guidance for the LLMs to optimize the Verilog implementation. BetterV has the ability to generate syntactically and functionally correct Verilog, which can outperform GPT-4 on the VerilogEval benchmark. With the help of task-specific generative discriminator, BetterV can achieve remarkable improvement on various electronic design automation (EDA) downstream tasks, including the netlist node reduction for synthesis and verification runtime reduction with Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linzhi Wu, Xingyu Zhang, Yakun Zhang, Changyan Zheng, Tiejun Liu, Liang Xie, Ye Yan, Erwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip reading, the process of interpreting silent speech from visual lip movements, has gained rising attention for its wide range of realistic applications. Deep learning approaches greatly improve current lip reading systems. However, lip reading in cross-speaker scenarios where the speaker identity changes, poses a challenging problem due to inter-speaker variability. A well-trained lip reading system may perform poorly when handling a brand new speaker. To learn a speaker-robust lip reading model, a key insight is to reduce visual variations across speakers, avoiding the model overfitting to specific speakers. In this work, in view of both input visual clues and latent representations based on a hybrid CTC/attention architecture, we propose to exploit the lip landmark-guided fine-grained visual clues instead of frequently-used mouth-cropped images as input features, diminishing speaker-specific appearance characteristics. Furthermore, a max-min mutual information regularization approach is proposed to capture speaker-insensitive latent representations. Experimental evaluations on public lip reading datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the intra-speaker and inter-speaker conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianfu Wang, Qilin Fan, Chao Wang, Long Yang, Leilei Ding, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an essential resource allocation task in network virtualization, aiming to map virtual network requests (VNRs) onto physical infrastructure. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to this problem. However, existing RL-based VNE methods are limited by the unidirectional action design and one-size-fits-all training strategy, resulting in restricted searchability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a FLexible And Generalizable RL framework for VNE, named FlagVNE. Specifically, we design a bidirectional action-based Markov decision process model that enables the joint selection of virtual and physical nodes, thus improving the exploration flexibility of solution space. To tackle the expansive and dynamic action space, we design a hierarchical decoder to generate adaptive action probability distributions and ensure high training efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of FlagVNE across multiple key metrics. Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/GeminiLight/flag-vne).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Zhang, Jeffrey Ichnowski, Daniel Seita, Jonathan Wang, Huang Huang, Ken Goldberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore how high-speed robot arm motions can dynamically manipulate cables to vault over obstacles, knock objects from pedestals, and weave between obstacles. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework that enables a UR5 robot to perform these three tasks. The framework finds a 3D apex point for the robot arm, which, together with a task-specific trajectory function, defines an arcing motion that dynamically manipulates the cable to perform tasks with varying obstacle and target locations. The trajectory function computes minimum-jerk motions that are constrained to remain within joint limits and to travel through the 3D apex point by repeatedly solving quadratic programs to find the shortest and fastest feasible motion. We experiment with 5 physical cables with different thickness and mass and compare performance against two baselines in which a human chooses the apex point. Results suggest that a baseline with a fixed apex across the three tasks achieves respective success rates of 51.7%, 36.7%, and 15.0%, and a baseline with human-specified, task-specific apex points achieves 66.7%, 56.7%, and 15.0% success rate respectively, while the robot using the learned apex point can achieve success rates of 81.7% in vaulting, 65.0% in knocking, and 60.0% in weaving.

<p>Abstract: We consider the safety-oriented performance of 3D object detectors in autonomous driving contexts. Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is gaining popularity as an effective approach for traffic signal control (TSC) and is increasingly applied in this domain. However, most existing RL methodologies are confined to a single-stage TSC framework, primarily focusing on selecting an appropriate traffic signal phase at fixed action intervals, leading to inflexible and less adaptable phase durations. To address such limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage TSC framework named DynamicLight. This framework initiates with a phase control strategy responsible for determining the optimal traffic phase, followed by a duration control strategy tasked with determining the corresponding phase duration. Experimental results show that DynamicLight outperforms state-of-the-art TSC models and exhibits exceptional model generalization capabilities. Additionally, the robustness and potential for real-world implementation of DynamicLight are further demonstrated and validated through various DynamicLight variants.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuer Pan, Brian Okorn, Harry Zhang, Ben Eisner, David Held</p>
<p>Abstract: How do we imbue robots with the ability to efficiently manipulate unseen objects and transfer relevant skills based on demonstrations? End-to-end learning methods often fail to generalize to novel objects or unseen configurations. Instead, we focus on the task-specific pose relationship between relevant parts of interacting objects. We conjecture that this relationship is a generalizable notion of a manipulation task that can transfer to new objects in the same category; examples include the relationship between the pose of a pan relative to an oven or the pose of a mug relative to a mug rack. We call this task-specific pose relationship "cross-pose" and provide a mathematical definition of this concept. We propose a vision-based system that learns to estimate the cross-pose between two objects for a given manipulation task using learned cross-object correspondences. The estimated cross-pose is then used to guide a downstream motion planner to manipulate the objects into the desired pose relationship (placing a pan into the oven or the mug onto the mug rack). We demonstrate our method's capability to generalize to unseen objects, in some cases after training on only 10 demonstrations in the real world. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world experiments across a number of tasks.

<p>Abstract: Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) aims to learn a model capable of identifying and disentangling the underlying factors hidden in the observable data in representation form. The process of separating underlying factors of variation into variables with semantic meaning benefits in learning explainable representations of data, which imitates the meaningful understanding process of humans when observing an object or relation. As a general learning strategy, DRL has demonstrated its power in improving the model explainability, controlability, robustness, as well as generalization capacity in a wide range of scenarios such as computer vision, natural language processing, and data mining. In this article, we comprehensively investigate DRL from various aspects including motivations, definitions, methodologies, evaluations, applications, and model designs. We first present two well-recognized definitions, i.e., Intuitive Definition and Group Theory Definition for disentangled representation learning. We further categorize the methodologies for DRL into four groups from the following perspectives, the model type, representation structure, supervision signal, and independence assumption. We also analyze principles to design different DRL models that may benefit different tasks in practical applications. Finally, we point out challenges in DRL as well as potential research directions deserving future investigations. We believe this work may provide insights for promoting the DRL research in the community.</p>

We begin by deriving information-theoretic quantities for deterministic networks as an alternative to unrealistic stochastic network assumptions. We then relate the optimization of the VICReg objective to mutual information optimization, highlighting underlying assumptions and facilitating a constructive comparison with other SSL algorithms and derive a generalization bound for VICReg, revealing its inherent advantages for downstream tasks. Building on these results, we introduce a family of SSL methods derived from information-theoretic principles that outperform existing SSL techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing traffic signal control (TSC) challenges. While most RL-based TSC systems typically employ an online approach, facilitating frequent active interaction with the environment, learning such strategies in the real world is impractical due to safety and risk concerns. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces an innovative offline data-driven approach, called DataLight. DataLight employs effective state representations and reward function by capturing vehicular speed information within the environment. It then segments roads to capture spatial information and further enhances the spatially segmented state representations with sequential modeling. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DataLight, showcasing superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art online and offline TSC methods. Additionally, DataLight exhibits robust learning capabilities concerning real-world deployment issues. The code is available at https://github.com/LiangZhang1996/DataLight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Seale Smith, Yen-Chang Hsu, Lingyu Zhang, Ting Hua, Zsolt Kira, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works demonstrate a remarkable ability to customize text-to-image diffusion models while only providing a few example images. What happens if you try to customize such models using multiple, fine-grained concepts in a sequential (i.e., continual) manner? In our work, we show that recent state-of-the-art customization of text-to-image models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when new concepts arrive sequentially. Specifically, when adding a new concept, the ability to generate high quality images of past, similar concepts degrade. To circumvent this forgetting, we propose a new method, C-LoRA, composed of a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation in cross attention layers of the popular Stable Diffusion model. Furthermore, we use customization prompts which do not include the word of the customized object (i.e., "person" for a human face dataset) and are initialized as completely random embeddings. Importantly, our method induces only marginal additional parameter costs and requires no storage of user data for replay. We show that C-LoRA not only outperforms several baselines for our proposed setting of text-to-image continual customization, which we refer to as Continual Diffusion, but that we achieve a new state-of-the-art in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting for image classification. The high achieving performance of C-LoRA in two separate domains positions it as a compelling solution for a wide range of applications, and we believe it has significant potential for practical impact.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pinzhen Chen, Zhicheng Guo, Barry Haddow, Kenneth Heafield</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose iteratively prompting a large language model to self-correct a translation, with inspiration from their strong language understanding and translation capability as well as a human-like translation approach. Interestingly, multi-turn querying reduces the output's string-based metric scores, but neural metrics suggest comparable or improved quality. Human evaluations indicate better fluency and naturalness compared to initial translations and even human references, all while maintaining quality. Ablation studies underscore the importance of anchoring the refinement to the source and a reasonable seed translation for quality considerations. We also discuss the challenges in evaluation and relation to human performance and translationese.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilong Wang, Lan Zhang, Chen Cao, Nanqing Luo, Peng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs can be used on code analysis tasks like code review, vulnerabilities analysis and etc. However, the strengths and limitations of adopting these LLMs to the code analysis are still unclear. In this paper, we delve into LLMs' capabilities in security-oriented program analysis, considering perspectives from both attackers and security analysts. We focus on two representative LLMs, ChatGPT and CodeBert, and evaluate their performance in solving typical analytic tasks with varying levels of difficulty. Our study demonstrates the LLM's efficiency in learning high-level semantics from code, positioning ChatGPT as a potential asset in security-oriented contexts. However, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations, such as the heavy reliance on well-defined variable and function names, making them unable to learn from anonymized code. For example, the performance of these LLMs heavily relies on the well-defined variable and function names, therefore, will not be able to learn anonymized code. We believe that the concerns raised in this case study deserve in-depth investigation in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansi Phute, Alec Helbling, Matthew Hull, ShengYun Peng, Sebastian Szyller, Cory Cornelius, Duen Horng Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are popular for high-quality text generation but can produce harmful content, even when aligned with human values through reinforcement learning. Adversarial prompts can bypass their safety measures. We propose LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks by having an LLM screen the induced responses. Our method does not require any fine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we incorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another instance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. We test LLM Self Defense on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2, two of the current most prominent LLMs against various types of attacks, such as forcefully inducing affirmative responses to prompts and prompt engineering attacks. Notably, LLM Self Defense succeeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 using both GPT 3.5 and Llama 2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupu Yao, Shangqi Deng, Zihan Cao, Harry Zhang, Liang-Jian Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have exhibited promising progress in video generation. However, they often struggle to retain consistent details within local regions across frames. One underlying cause is that traditional diffusion models approximate Gaussian noise distribution by utilizing predictive noise, without fully accounting for the impact of inherent information within the input itself. Additionally, these models emphasize the distinction between predictions and references, neglecting information intrinsic to the videos. To address this limitation, inspired by the self-attention mechanism, we propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation network structure based on diffusion models, dubbed Additional Perturbation for Latent noise with Adversarial training (APLA). Our approach only necessitates a single video as input and builds upon pre-trained stable diffusion networks. Notably, we introduce an additional compact network, known as the Video Generation Transformer (VGT). This auxiliary component is designed to extract perturbations from the inherent information contained within the input, thereby refining inconsistent pixels during temporal predictions. We leverage a hybrid architecture of transformers and convolutions to compensate for temporal intricacies, enhancing consistency between different frames within the video. Experiments demonstrate a noticeable improvement in the consistency of the generated videos both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Thomas, Seth Spielman, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.
  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality ``gold'' labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Clinical Prediction with Large Language Models (CPLLM), a method that involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for clinical disease and readmission prediction. We utilized quantization and fine-tuned the LLM using prompts. For diagnosis prediction, we predict whether patients will be diagnosed with a target disease during their next visit or in the subsequent diagnosis, leveraging their historical diagnosis records. We compared our results to various baselines, including RETAIN, and Med-BERT, the current state-of-the-art model for disease prediction using temporal structured EHR data. In addition, We also evaluated CPLLM for patient hospital readmission prediction and compared our method's performance with benchmark baselines. Our experiments have shown that our proposed method, CPLLM, surpasses all the tested models in terms of PR-AUC and ROC-AUC metrics, showing state-of-the-art results for diagnosis prediction and patient hospital readmission prediction. Such a method can be easily implemented and integrated into the clinical process to help care providers estimate the next steps of patients</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Ranaldi, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (It-LLMs) have been exhibiting outstanding abilities to reason around cognitive states, intentions, and reactions of all people involved, letting humans guide and comprehend day-to-day social interactions effectively. In fact, several multiple-choice questions (MCQ) benchmarks have been proposed to construct solid assessments of the models' abilities. However, earlier works are demonstrating the presence of inherent "order bias" in It-LLMs, posing challenges to the appropriate evaluation. In this paper, we investigate It-LLMs' resilience abilities towards a series of probing tests using four MCQ benchmarks. Introducing adversarial examples, we show a significant performance gap, mainly when varying the order of the choices, which reveals a selection bias and brings into discussion reasoning abilities. Following a correlation between first positions and model choices due to positional bias, we hypothesized the presence of structural heuristics in the decision-making process of the It-LLMs, strengthened by including significant examples in few-shot scenarios. Finally, by using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique, we elicit the model to reason and mitigate the bias by obtaining more robust models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flavio Figueiredo, Jos\'e Geraldo Fernandes, Jackson Silva, Renato M. Assun\c{c}\~ao</p>
<p>Abstract: Copulas are powerful statistical tools for capturing dependencies across multiple data dimensions. Applying Copulas involves estimating independent marginals, a straightforward task, followed by the much more challenging task of determining a single copulating function, $C$, that links these marginals. For bivariate data, a copula takes the form of a two-increasing function $C: (u,v)\in \mathbb{I}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{I}$, where $\mathbb{I} = [0, 1]$. In this paper, we propose 2-Cats, a Neural Network (NN) model that learns two-dimensional Copulas while preserving their key properties, without relying on specific Copula families (e.g., Archimedean). Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy inspired by the literature on Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Sobolev Training. Our proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art across various datasets while maintaining the fundamental mathematical properties of a Copula.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert J\"ochl, Andreas Uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of temporal image forensics, it is not evident that a neural network, trained on images from different time-slots (classes), exploits solely image age related features. Usually, images taken in close temporal proximity (e.g., belonging to the same age class) share some common content properties. Such content bias can be exploited by a neural network. In this work, a novel approach is proposed that evaluates the influence of image content. This approach is verified using synthetic images (where content bias can be ruled out) with an age signal embedded. Based on the proposed approach, it is shown that a deep learning approach proposed in the context of age classification is most likely highly dependent on the image content. As a possible countermeasure, two different models from the field of image steganalysis, along with three different preprocessing techniques to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (age signal to image content), are evaluated using the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Khodak, Edmond Chow, Maria-Florina Balcan, Ameet Talwalkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving a linear system $Ax=b$ is a fundamental scientific computing primitive for which numerous solvers and preconditioners have been developed. These come with parameters whose optimal values depend on the system being solved and are often impossible or too expensive to identify; thus in practice sub-optimal heuristics are used. We consider the common setting in which many related linear systems need to be solved, e.g. during a single numerical simulation. In this scenario, can we sequentially choose parameters that attain a near-optimal overall number of iterations, without extra matrix computations? We answer in the affirmative for Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), a standard solver whose parameter $\omega$ has a strong impact on its runtime. For this method, we prove that a bandit online learning algorithm--using only the number of iterations as feedback--can select parameters for a sequence of instances such that the overall cost approaches that of the best fixed $\omega$ as the sequence length increases. Furthermore, when given additional structural information, we show that a contextual bandit method asymptotically achieves the performance of the instance-optimal policy, which selects the best $\omega$ for each instance. Our work provides the first learning-theoretic treatment of high-precision linear system solvers and the first end-to-end guarantees for data-driven scientific computing, demonstrating theoretically the potential to speed up numerical methods using well-understood learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Spadon, Jay Kumar, Derek Eden, Josh van Berkel, Tom Foster, Amilcar Soares, Ronan Fablet, Stan Matwin, Ronald Pelot</p>
<p>Abstract: Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creoles represent an under-explored and marginalized group of languages, with few available resources for NLP research.While the genealogical ties between Creoles and a number of highly-resourced languages imply a significant potential for transfer learning, this potential is hampered due to this lack of annotated data. In this work we present CreoleVal, a collection of benchmark datasets spanning 8 different NLP tasks, covering up to 28 Creole languages; it is an aggregate of novel development datasets for reading comprehension, relation classification, and machine translation for Creoles, in addition to a practical gateway to a handful of preexisting benchmarks. For each benchmark, we conduct baseline experiments in a zero-shot setting in order to further ascertain the capabilities and limitations of transfer learning for Creoles. Ultimately, we see CreoleVal as an opportunity to empower research on Creoles in NLP and computational linguistics, and in general, a step towards more equitable language technology around the globe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this ``curse of memory'' as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjie Duan, Zhiyu Pan, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to minutia-based fingerprint representations, fixed-length representations are attractive due to simple and efficient matching. However, fixed-length fingerprint representations are limited in accuracy when matching fingerprints with different visible areas, which can occur due to different finger poses or acquisition methods. To address this issue, we propose a localized deep representation of fingerprint, named LDRF. By focusing on the discriminative characteristics within local regions, LDRF provides a more robust and accurate fixed-length representation for fingerprints with variable visible areas. LDRF can be adapted to retain information within any valid area, making it highly flexible. The matching scores produced by LDRF also exhibit intuitive statistical characteristics, which led us to propose a matching score normalization technique to mitigate the uncertainty in the cases of very small overlapping area. With this new technique, we can maintain a high level of accuracy and reliability in our fingerprint matching, even as the size of the database grows rapidly. Our experimental results on 21 datasets containing over 140K fingerprints of various finger poses and impression types show that LDRF outperforms other fixed-length representations and is robust to sensing technologies and impression types. Besides, the proposed matching score normalization effectively reduces the false match rate (FMR) in large-scale identification experiments comprising over 5.11 million fingerprints. Specifically, this technique results in a reduction of two orders of magnitude compared to matching without matching score normalization and five orders of magnitude compared to prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghao Ni, Zinan Lin, Shuaiqi Wang, Giulia Fanti</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values of a time series given the past values. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on this problem is attained in some cases by linear-centric models, which primarily feature a linear mapping layer. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they are not able to adapt their prediction rules to periodic changes in time series patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts-style augmentation for linear-centric models and propose Mixture-of-Linear-Experts (MoLE). Instead of training a single model, MoLE trains multiple linear-centric models (i.e., experts) and a router model that weighs and mixes their outputs. While the entire framework is trained end-to-end, each expert learns to specialize in a specific temporal pattern, and the router model learns to compose the experts adaptively. Experiments show that MoLE reduces forecasting error of linear-centric models, including DLinear, RLinear, and RMLP, in over 78% of the datasets and settings we evaluated. By using MoLE existing linear-centric models can achieve SOTA LTSF results in 68% of the experiments that PatchTST reports and we compare to, whereas existing single-head linear-centric models achieve SOTA results in only 25% of cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the prevalence of pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm, how to efficiently adapt the pre-trained model to the downstream tasks has been an intriguing issue. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed for low-cost adaptation. Although PEFT has demonstrated effectiveness and been widely applied, the underlying principles are still unclear. In this paper, we adopt the PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound, viewing pre-training as a shift of prior distribution which leads to a tighter bound for generalization error. We validate this shift from the perspectives of oscillations in the loss landscape and the quasi-sparsity in gradient distribution. Based on this, we propose a gradient-based sparse fine-tuning algorithm, named Sparse Increment Fine-Tuning (SIFT), and validate its effectiveness on a range of tasks including the GLUE Benchmark and Instruction-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghan Lee, Taeyoung Park, Kibok Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a self-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. Specifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple patch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and training/inference time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, \textbf{Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC)}, that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Hong Cheng, Paul St\"ockel, Xingyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling and calibrating the fidelity of synthetic data is paramount in shaping the future of safe and reliable self-driving technology by offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative to real-world data collection. We focus on its role in safety-critical applications, introducing four types of instance-level fidelity that go beyond mere visual input characteristics. The aim is to ensure that applying testing on synthetic data can reveal real-world safety issues, and the absence of safety-critical issues when testing under synthetic data can provide a strong safety guarantee in real-world behavior. We suggest an optimization method to refine the synthetic data generator, reducing fidelity gaps identified by deep learning components. Experiments show this tuning enhances the correlation between safety-critical errors in synthetic and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e Artelt, Shubham Sharma, Freddy Lecu\'e, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide a popular method for analyzing the predictions of black-box systems, and they can offer the opportunity for computational recourse by suggesting actionable changes on how to change the input to obtain a different (i.e. more favorable) system output. However, recent work highlighted their vulnerability to different types of manipulations. This work studies the vulnerability of counterfactual explanations to data poisoning. We formalize data poisoning in the context of counterfactual explanations for increasing the cost of recourse on three different levels: locally for a single instance, or a sub-group of instances, or globally for all instances. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods \& toolboxes are vulnerable to such data poisoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li, Zhiyu Zoey Chen, Mike Ross, Patrick Huber, Seungwhan Moon, Zhaojiang Lin, Xin Luna Dong, Adithya Sagar, Xifeng Yan, Paul A. Crook</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities. We have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/FnCTOD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evan Gerritz, Luciano Dyballa, Steven W. Zucker</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization to unseen data is a key desideratum for deep networks, but its relation to classification accuracy is unclear. Using a minimalist vision dataset and a measure of generalizability, we show that popular networks, from deep convolutional networks (CNNs) to transformers, vary in their power to extrapolate to unseen classes both across layers and across architectures. Accuracy is not a good predictor of generalizability, and generalization varies non-monotonically with layer depth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqi Chen, Eugene Lim, Kelvin Lin, Yiyang Chen, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning empowers artificial agents to mimic behavior by learning from demonstrations. Recently, diffusion models, which have the ability to model high-dimensional and multimodal distributions, have shown impressive performance on imitation learning tasks. These models learn to shape a policy by diffusing actions (or states) from standard Gaussian noise. However, the target policy to be learned is often significantly different from Gaussian and this mismatch can result in poor performance when using a small number of diffusion steps (to improve inference speed) and under limited data. The key idea in this work is that initiating from a more informative source than Gaussian enables diffusion methods to mitigate the above limitations. We contribute both theoretical results, a new method, and empirical findings that show the benefits of using an informative source policy. Our method, which we call BRIDGER, leverages the stochastic interpolants framework to bridge arbitrary policies, thus enabling a flexible approach towards imitation learning. It generalizes prior work in that standard Gaussians can still be applied, but other source policies can be used if available. In experiments on challenging simulation benchmarks and on real robots, BRIDGER outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies. We provide further analysis on design considerations when applying BRIDGER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Grand, Valerio Pepe, Jacob Andreas, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Questions combine our mastery of language with our remarkable facility for reasoning about uncertainty. How do people navigate vast hypothesis spaces to pose informative questions given limited cognitive resources? We study these tradeoffs in a classic grounded question-asking task based on the board game Battleship. Our language-informed program sampling (LIPS) model uses large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language questions, translate them into symbolic programs, and evaluate their expected information gain. We find that with a surprisingly modest resource budget, this simple Monte Carlo optimization strategy yields informative questions that mirror human performance across varied Battleship board scenarios. In contrast, LLM-only baselines struggle to ground questions in the board state; notably, GPT-4V provides no improvement over non-visual baselines. Our results illustrate how Bayesian models of question-asking can leverage the statistics of language to capture human priors, while highlighting some shortcomings of pure LLMs as grounded reasoners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaojian Chen, Qiben Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving stable diffusion framework leveraging homomorphic encryption, called HE-Diffusion, which primarily focuses on protecting the denoising phase of the diffusion process. HE-Diffusion is a tailored encryption framework specifically designed to align with the unique architecture of stable diffusion, ensuring both privacy and functionality. To address the inherent computational challenges, we propose a novel min-distortion method that enables efficient partial image encryption, significantly reducing the overhead without compromising the model's output quality. Furthermore, we adopt a sparse tensor representation to expedite computational operations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the privacy-preserving diffusion process. We successfully implement HE-based privacy-preserving stable diffusion inference. The experimental results show that HE-Diffusion achieves 500 times speedup compared with the baseline method, and reduces time cost of the homomorphically encrypted inference to the minute level. Both the performance and accuracy of the HE-Diffusion are on par with the plaintext counterpart. Our approach marks a significant step towards integrating advanced cryptographic techniques with state-of-the-art generative models, paving the way for privacy-preserving and efficient image generation in critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kira Wursthorn, Markus Hillemann, Markus Ulrich</p>
<p>Abstract: The estimation of 6D object poses is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.</p>

Maddix, Hao Wang, Michael W. Mahoney, Kari Torkkola, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Michael Bohlke-Schneider, Yuyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Chronos, a simple yet effective framework for pretrained probabilistic time series models. Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Shaer, Soodeh Nikan, Abdallah Shami</p>
<p>Abstract: The hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) process is imperative for finding the best-performing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The automation process of HPO is characterized by its sizable computational footprint and its lack of transparency; both important factors in a resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environment. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a novel approach that combines transformer architecture and actor-critic Reinforcement Learning (RL) model, TRL-HPO, equipped with multi-headed attention that enables parallelization and progressive generation of layers. These assumptions are founded empirically by evaluating TRL-HPO on the MNIST dataset and comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches that build CNN models from scratch. The results show that TRL-HPO outperforms the classification results of these approaches by 6.8% within the same time frame, demonstrating the efficiency of TRL-HPO for the HPO process. The analysis of the results identifies the main culprit for performance degradation attributed to stacking fully connected layers. This paper identifies new avenues for improving RL-based HPO processes in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Expert-Token-Routing, a unified generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration of multiple expert LLMs. Our framework represents expert LLMs as special expert tokens within the vocabulary of a meta LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of generative AI models has revolutionized digital content creation, yet it introduces challenges in maintaining copyright integrity due to generative parroting, where models mimic their training data too closely. Our research presents a novel approach to tackle this issue by employing an overfitted Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to detect such parroted samples effectively.

Preliminary evaluations demonstrate promising results, suggesting our method's potential to ensure ethical use and enhance the legal compliance of generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu Luo, Xi Lin, Zhenkun Wang, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The end-to-end neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) method shows promising performance in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems without the need for expert design. However, existing methods struggle with large-scale problems, hindering their practical applicability. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel Self-Improved Learning (SIL) method for better scalability of neural combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we develop an efficient self-improved mechanism that enables direct model training on large-scale problem instances without any labeled data. Powered by an innovative local reconstruction approach, this method can iteratively generate better solutions by itself as pseudo-labels to guide efficient model training. In addition, we design a linear complexity attention mechanism for the model to efficiently handle large-scale combinatorial problem instances with low computation overhead. Comprehensive experiments on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with up to 100K nodes in both uniform and real-world distributions demonstrate the superior scalability of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangjian Li, Tao Zhu, Furong Duan, Liming Chen, Huansheng Ning, Christopher Nugent, Yaping Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a critical research domain in activity perception. However, achieving high efficiency and long sequence recognition remains a challenge. Despite the extensive investigation of temporal deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, their extensive parameters often pose significant computational and memory constraints, rendering them less suitable for resource-constrained mobile health applications. This study introduces HARMamba, an innovative light-weight and versatile HAR architecture that combines selective bidirectional SSM and hardware-aware design. To optimize real-time resource consumption in practical scenarios, HARMamba employs linear recursive mechanisms and parameter discretization, allowing it to selectively focus on relevant input sequences while efficiently fusing scan and recompute operations. To address potential issues with invalid sensor data, the system processes the data stream through independent channels, dividing each channel into "patches" and appending classification token to the end of the sequence. Position embeddings are incorporated to represent the sequence order, and the activity categories are output through a classification header. The HARMamba Block serves as the fundamental component of the HARMamba architecture, enabling the effective capture of more discriminative activity sequence features. HARMamba outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks, delivering comparable or better accuracy with significantly reducing computational and memory demands. It's effectiveness has been extensively validated on public datasets like PAMAP2, WISDM, UNIMIB SHAR and UCI, showcasing impressive results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Wan, Arjun Subramonian, Anaelia Ovalle, Zongyu Lin, Ashima Suvarna, Christina Chance, Hritik Bansal, Rebecca Pattichis, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancement of large and powerful models with Text-to-Image (T2I) generation abilities -- such as OpenAI's DALLE-3 and Google's Gemini -- enables users to generate high-quality images from textual prompts. However, it has become increasingly evident that even simple prompts could cause T2I models to exhibit conspicuous social bias in generated images. Such bias might lead to both allocational and representational harms in society, further marginalizing minority groups. Noting this problem, a large body of recent works has been dedicated to investigating different dimensions of bias in T2I systems. However, an extensive review of these studies is lacking, hindering a systematic understanding of current progress and research gaps. We present the first extensive survey on bias in T2I generative models. In this survey, we review prior studies on dimensions of bias: Gender, Skintone, and Geo-Culture. Specifically, we discuss how these works define, evaluate, and mitigate different aspects of bias. We found that: (1) while gender and skintone biases are widely studied, geo-cultural bias remains under-explored; (2) most works on gender and skintone bias investigated occupational association, while other aspects are less frequently studied; (3) almost all gender bias works overlook non-binary identities in their studies; (4) evaluation datasets and metrics are scattered, with no unified framework for measuring biases; and (5) current mitigation methods fail to resolve biases comprehensively. Based on current limitations, we point out future research directions that contribute to human-centric definitions, evaluations, and mitigation of biases. We hope to highlight the importance of studying biases in T2I systems, as well as encourage future efforts to holistically understand and tackle biases, building fair and trustworthy T2I technologies for everyone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Antipov, Benjamin Doerr, Alexandra Ivanova</p>
<p>Abstract: Experience shows that typical evolutionary algorithms can cope well with stochastic disturbances such as noisy function evaluations.
  In this first mathematical runtime analysis of the $(1+\lambda)$ and $(1,\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithms in the presence of prior bit-wise noise, we show that both algorithms can tolerate constant noise probabilities without increasing the asymptotic runtime on the OneMax benchmark. For this, a population size $\lambda$ suffices that is at least logarithmic in the problem size $n$. The only previous result in this direction regarded the less realistic one-bit noise model, required a population size super-linear in the problem size, and proved a runtime guarantee roughly cubic in the noiseless runtime for the OneMax benchmark. Our significantly stronger results are based on the novel proof argument that the noiseless offspring can be seen as a biased uniform crossover between the parent and the noisy offspring. We are optimistic that the technical lemmas resulting from this insight will find applications also in future mathematical runtime analyses of evolutionary algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nooshin Yousefzadeh, Rahul Sengupta, Yashaswi Karnati, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic congestion has significant economic, environmental, and social ramifications. Intersection traffic flow dynamics are influenced by numerous factors. While microscopic traffic simulators are valuable tools, they are computationally intensive and challenging to calibrate. Moreover, existing machine-learning approaches struggle to provide lane-specific waveforms or adapt to intersection topology and traffic patterns. In this study, we propose two efficient and accurate "Digital Twin" models for intersections, leveraging Graph Attention Neural Networks (GAT). These attentional graph auto-encoder digital twins capture temporal, spatial, and contextual aspects of traffic within intersections, incorporating various influential factors such as high-resolution loop detector waveforms, signal state records, driving behaviors, and turning-movement counts. Trained on diverse counterfactual scenarios across multiple intersections, our models generalize well, enabling the estimation of detailed traffic waveforms for any intersection approach and exit lanes. Multi-scale error metrics demonstrate that our models perform comparably to microsimulations. The primary application of our study lies in traffic signal optimization, a pivotal area in transportation systems research. These lightweight digital twins can seamlessly integrate into corridor and network signal timing optimization frameworks. Furthermore, our study's applications extend to lane reconfiguration, driving behavior analysis, and facilitating informed decisions regarding intersection safety and efficiency enhancements. A promising avenue for future research involves extending this approach to urban freeway corridors and integrating it with measures of effectiveness metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fergal Stapleton, Edgar Galv\'an</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) play a crucial role in the architectural configuration and training of Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a process known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart. This efficiency advantage adds to the overall appeal of our proposed NeuroLGP-SM in optimising the configuration of large DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hantian Ding, Zijian Wang, Giovanni Paolini, Varun Kumar, Anoop Deoras, Dan Roth, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: In large language model training, input documents are typically concatenated together and then split into sequences of equal length to avoid padding tokens. Despite its efficiency, the concatenation approach compromises data integrity -- it inevitably breaks many documents into incomplete pieces, leading to excessive truncations that hinder the model from learning to compose logically coherent and factually consistent content that is grounded on the complete context. To address the issue, we propose Best-fit Packing, a scalable and efficient method that packs documents into training sequences through length-aware combinatorial optimization. Our method completely eliminates unnecessary truncations while retaining the same training efficiency as concatenation. Empirical results from both text and code pre-training show that our method achieves superior performance (e.g., relatively +4.7% on reading comprehension; +16.8% in context following; and +9.2% on program synthesis), and reduces closed-domain hallucination effectively by up to 58.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Xue, Yongxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples for diffusion models are widely used as solutions for safety concerns. By adding adversarial perturbations to personal images, attackers can not edit or imitate them easily. However, it is essential to note that all these protections target the latent diffusion model (LDMs), the adversarial examples for diffusion models in the pixel space (PDMs) are largely overlooked. This may mislead us to think that the diffusion models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like most deep models. In this paper, we show novel findings that: even though gradient-based white-box attacks can be used to attack the LDMs, they fail to attack PDMs. This finding is supported by extensive experiments of almost a wide range of attacking methods on various PDMs and LDMs with different model structures, which means diffusion models are indeed much more robust against adversarial attacks. We also find that PDMs can be used as an off-the-shelf purifier to effectively remove the adversarial patterns that were generated on LDMs to protect the images, which means that most protection methods nowadays, to some extent, cannot protect our images from malicious attacks. We hope that our insights will inspire the community to rethink the adversarial samples for diffusion models as protection methods and move forward to more effective protection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingqing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing temporal point process models are characterized by conditional intensity function. These models often require numerical approximation methods for likelihood evaluation, which potentially hurts their performance. By directly modelling the integral of the intensity function, i.e., the cumulative hazard function (CHF), the likelihood can be evaluated accurately, making it a promising approach. However, existing CHF-based methods are not well-defined, i.e., the mathematical constraints of CHF are not completely satisfied, leading to untrustworthy results. For multivariate temporal point process, most existing methods model intensity (or density, etc.) functions for each variate, limiting the scalability. In this paper, we explore using neural networks to model a flexible but well-defined CHF and learning the multivariate temporal point process with low parameter complexity. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on data fitting and event prediction tasks while having significantly fewer parameters and memory usage than the strong competitors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwesha Das (Saarland University, Germany), Zekun Wu (Saarland University, Germany), Iza \v{S}krjanec (Saarland University, Germany), Anna Maria Feit (Saarland University, Germany)</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual highlighting can guide user attention in complex interfaces. However, its effectiveness under limited attentional capacities is underexplored. This paper examines the joint impact of visual highlighting (permanent and dynamic) and dual-task-induced cognitive load on gaze behaviour. Our analysis, using eye-movement data from 27 participants viewing 150 unique webpages reveals that while participants' ability to attend to UI elements decreases with increasing cognitive load, dynamic adaptations (i.e., highlighting) remain attention-grabbing. The presence of these factors significantly alters what people attend to and thus what is salient. Accordingly, we show that state-of-the-art saliency models increase their performance when accounting for different cognitive loads. Our empirical insights, along with our openly available dataset, enhance our understanding of attentional processes in UIs under varying cognitive (and perceptual) loads and open the door for new models that can predict user attention while multitasking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Hossein Sekhavat, Qingqing Cao, Maxwell Horton, Yanzi Jin, Chenfan Sun, Iman Mirzadeh, Mahyar Najibi, Dmitry Belenko, Peter Zatloukal, Mohammad Rastegari</p>
<p>Abstract: The reproducibility and transparency of large language models are crucial for advancing open research, ensuring the trustworthiness of results, and enabling investigations into data and model biases, as well as potential risks. To this end, we release OpenELM, a state-of-the-art open language model. OpenELM uses a layer-wise scaling strategy to efficiently allocate parameters within each layer of the transformer model, leading to enhanced accuracy. For example, with a parameter budget of approximately one billion parameters, OpenELM exhibits a 2.36% improvement in accuracy compared to OLMo while requiring $2\times$ fewer pre-training tokens.
  Diverging from prior practices that only provide model weights and inference code, and pre-train on private datasets, our release includes the complete framework for training and evaluation of the language model on publicly available datasets, including training logs, multiple checkpoints, and pre-training configurations. We also release code to convert models to MLX library for inference and fine-tuning on Apple devices. This comprehensive release aims to empower and strengthen the open research community, paving the way for future open research endeavors.
  Our source code along with pre-trained model weights and training recipes is available at \url{https://github.com/apple/corenet}. Additionally, \model models can be found on HuggingFace at: \url{https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM}.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19048">A Framework for Real-time Safeguarding the Text Generation of Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Dong, Dayi Lin, Shaowei Wang, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also pose ethical and societal risks due to their propensity to generate harmful content. To address this, various approaches have been developed to safeguard LLMs from producing unsafe content. However, existing methods have limitations, including the need for training specific control models and proactive intervention during text generation, that lead to quality degradation and increased computational overhead. To mitigate those limitations, we propose LLMSafeGuard, a lightweight framework to safeguard LLM text generation in real-time. LLMSafeGuard integrates an external validator into the beam search algorithm during decoding, rejecting candidates that violate safety constraints while allowing valid ones to proceed. We introduce a similarity based validation approach, simplifying constraint introduction and eliminating the need for control model training. Additionally, LLMSafeGuard employs a context-wise timing selection strategy, intervening LLMs only when necessary. We evaluate LLMSafeGuard on two tasks, detoxification and copyright safeguarding, and demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA baselines. For instance, LLMSafeGuard reduces the average toxic score of. LLM output by 29.7% compared to the best baseline meanwhile preserving similar linguistic quality as natural output in detoxification task. Similarly, in the copyright task, LLMSafeGuard decreases the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) by 56.2% compared to baselines. Moreover, our context-wise timing selection strategy reduces inference time by at least 24% meanwhile maintaining comparable effectiveness as validating each time step. LLMSafeGuard also offers tunable parameters to balance its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19232">GRAMMAR: Grounded and Modular Methodology for Assessment of Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhe Li, Ming Liu, Shang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been actively studied and deployed across various industries to query on domain-specific knowledge base. However, evaluating these systems presents unique challenges due to the scarcity of domain-specific queries and corresponding ground truths, as well as a lack of systematic approaches to diagnosing the cause of failure cases -- whether they stem from knowledge deficits or issues related to system robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce GRAMMAR (GRounded And Modular Methodology for Assessment of RAG), an evaluation framework comprising two key elements: 1) a data generation process that leverages relational databases and LLMs to efficiently produce scalable query-answer pairs. This method facilitates the separation of query logic from linguistic variations for enhanced debugging capabilities; and 2) an evaluation framework that differentiates knowledge gaps from robustness and enables the identification of defective modules. Our empirical results underscore the limitations of current reference-free evaluation approaches and the reliability of GRAMMAR to accurately identify model vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model pre-training has become increasingly expensive, with most practitioners relying on scaling laws to allocate compute budgets for model size and training tokens, commonly referred to as Compute-Optimal or Chinchilla Optimal. In this paper, we hypothesize a new scaling law that suggests model performance depends mostly on the amount of compute spent for transformer-based models, independent of the specific allocation to model size and dataset size. Using this unified scaling law, we predict that (a) for inference efficiency, training should prioritize smaller model sizes and larger training datasets, and (b) assuming the exhaustion of available web datasets, scaling the model size might be the only way to further improve model performance.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756">KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Liu, Yixuan Wang, Sachin Vaidya, Fabian Ruehle, James Halverson, Marin Solja\v{c}i\'c, Thomas Y. Hou, Max Tegmark</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenning Yang, Ryan Krawec, Liang-Yuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: As the deployment of NLP systems in critical applications grows, ensuring the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks becomes increasingly important. Large language models excel in various NLP tasks but remain vulnerable to low-cost adversarial attacks. Focusing on the domain of conversation entailment, where multi-turn dialogues serve as premises to verify hypotheses, we fine-tune a transformer model to accurately discern the truthfulness of these hypotheses. Adversaries manipulate hypotheses through synonym swapping, aiming to deceive the model into making incorrect predictions. To counteract these attacks, we implemented innovative fine-tuning techniques and introduced an embedding perturbation loss method to significantly bolster the model's robustness. Our findings not only emphasize the importance of defending against adversarial attacks in NLP but also highlight the real-world implications, suggesting that enhancing model robustness is critical for reliable NLP applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugh Zhang, Jeff Da, Dean Lee, Vaughn Robinson, Catherine Wu, Will Song, Tiffany Zhao, Pranav Raja, Dylan Slack, Qin Lyu, Sean Hendryx, Russell Kaplan, Michele Lunati, Summer Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.</p>
