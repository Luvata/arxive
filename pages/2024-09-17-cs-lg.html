<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Huang, Tao Wu, Wang Lin, Shengyu Zhang, Jingyuan Chen, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, there has been a growing interest in their capabilities in mathematical reasoning. However, existing research has primarily focused on text-based algebra problems, neglecting the study of geometry due to the lack of high-quality geometric datasets. To address this gap, this paper introduces AutoGeo, a novel approach for automatically generating mathematical geometric images to fulfill the demand for large-scale and diverse geometric datasets. AutoGeo facilitates the creation of AutoGeo-100k, an extensive repository comprising 100k high-quality geometry image-text pairs. By leveraging precisely defined geometric clauses, AutoGeo-100k contains a wide variety of geometric shapes, including lines, polygons, circles, and complex spatial relationships, etc. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of AutoGeo-100k in enhancing the performance of multimodal large language models through fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in the model's ability in handling geometric images, as evidenced by enhanced accuracy in tasks such as geometric captioning and mathematical reasoning. This research not only fills a critical gap in the availability of geometric datasets but also paves the way for the advancement of sophisticated AI-driven tools in education and research.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09056">Identifying Factors to Help Improve Existing Decomposition-Based PMI Estimation Methods</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna-Maria Nau, Phillip Ditto, Dawnie Wolfe Steadman, Audris Mockus</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately assessing the postmortem interval (PMI) is an important task in forensic science. Some of the existing techniques use regression models that use a decomposition score to predict the PMI or accumulated degree days (ADD), however, the provided formulas are based on very small samples and the accuracy is low. With the advent of Big Data, much larger samples can be used to improve PMI estimation methods. We, therefore, aim to investigate ways to improve PMI prediction accuracy by (a) using a much larger sample size, (b) employing more advanced linear models, and (c) enhancing models with factors known to affect the human decay process. Specifically, this study involved the curation of a sample of 249 human subjects from a large-scale decomposition dataset, followed by evaluating pre-existing PMI/ADD formulas and fitting increasingly sophisticated models to estimate the PMI/ADD. Results showed that including the total decomposition score (TDS), demographic factors (age, biological sex, and BMI), and weather-related factors (season of discovery, temperature history, and humidity history) increased the accuracy of the PMI/ADD models. Furthermore, the best performing PMI estimation model using the TDS, demographic, and weather-related features as predictors resulted in an adjusted R-squared of 0.34 and an RMSE of 0.95. It had a 7% lower RMSE than a model using only the TDS to predict the PMI and a 48% lower RMSE than the pre-existing PMI formula. The best ADD estimation model, also using the TDS, demographic, and weather-related features as predictors, resulted in an adjusted R-squared of 0.52 and an RMSE of 0.89. It had an 11% lower RMSE than the model using only the TDS to predict the ADD and a 52% lower RMSE than the pre-existing ADD formula. This work demonstrates the need (and way) to incorporate demographic and environmental factors into PMI/ADD estimation models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09085">HESSO: Towards Automatic Efficient and User Friendly Any Neural Network Training and Pruning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Chen, Xiaoyi Qu, David Aponte, Colby Banbury, Jongwoo Ko, Tianyu Ding, Yong Ma, Vladimir Lyapunov, Ilya Zharkov, Luming Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the most popular approaches to effectively compress the heavy deep neural networks (DNNs) into compact sub-networks while retaining performance. The existing methods suffer from multi-stage procedures along with significant engineering efforts and human expertise. The Only-Train-Once (OTO) series has been recently proposed to resolve the many pain points by streamlining the workflow by automatically conducting (i) search space generation, (ii) structured sparse optimization, and (iii) sub-network construction. However, the built-in sparse optimizers in the OTO series, i.e., the Half-Space Projected Gradient (HSPG) family, have limitations that require hyper-parameter tuning and the implicit controls of the sparsity exploration, consequently requires intervening by human expertise. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Efficient Structured Sparse Optimizer (HESSO). HESSO could automatically and efficiently train a DNN to produce a high-performing subnetwork. Meanwhile, it is almost tuning-free and enjoys user-friendly integration for generic training applications. To address another common issue of irreversible performance collapse observed in pruning DNNs, we further propose a Corrective Redundant Identification Cycle (CRIC) for reliably identifying indispensable structures. We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of HESSO and its enhanced version HESSO-CRIC on a variety of applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, including large language model. The numerical results showcase that HESSO can achieve competitive even superior performance to varying state-of-the-arts and support most DNN architectures. Meanwhile, CRIC can effectively prevent the irreversible performance collapse and further enhance the performance of HESSO on certain applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Ning, Jieru Zhao, Qihao Jin, Wenchao Ding, Minyi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are distinguished by their multimodal comprehensive ability and widely used in many real-world applications including GPT-4o, autonomous driving and robotics. Despite their impressive performance, the multimodal inputs always incur long context. The inference under long context requires caching massive Key and Value states (KV cache) of previous tokens, which introduces high latency and excessive memory consumption. Due to this reason, it is challenging to deploy streaming inference of MLLMs on edge devices, which largely constrains the power and usage of MLLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Inf-MLLM, an efficient inference framework for MLLMs, which enable streaming inference of MLLM on a single GPU with infinite context. Inf-MLLM is based on our key observation of the attention pattern in both LLMs and MLLMs called "attention saddles". Thanks to the newly discovered attention pattern, Inf-MLLM maintains a size-constrained KV cache by dynamically caching recent tokens and relevant tokens. Furthermore, Inf-MLLM proposes attention bias, a novel approach to enable MLLMs to capture long-term dependency. We show that Inf-MLLM enables multiple LLMs and MLLMs to achieve stable performance over 4M-token long texts and multi-round conversations with 1-hour-long videos on a single GPU. In addition, Inf-MLLM exhibits superior streaming reasoning quality than existing methods such as StreamingLLM and 2x speedup than H2O.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efthymios Georgiou, Georgios Paraskevopoulos, Alexandros Potamianos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Y-Drop, a regularization method that biases the dropout algorithm towards dropping more important neurons with higher probability. The backbone of our approach is neuron conductance, an interpretable measure of neuron importance that calculates the contribution of each neuron towards the end-to-end mapping of the network. We investigate the impact of the uniform dropout selection criterion on performance by assigning higher dropout probability to the more important units. We show that forcing the network to solve the task at hand in the absence of its important units yields a strong regularization effect. Further analysis indicates that Y-Drop yields solutions where more neurons are important, i.e have high conductance, and yields robust networks. In our experiments we show that the regularization effect of Y-Drop scales better than vanilla dropout w.r.t. the architecture size and consistently yields superior performance over multiple datasets and architecture combinations, with little tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuezhou Hu, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is costly. Fortunately, Nvidia Ampere and Hopper GPUs can accelerate matrix multiplications twice as fast as a dense equivalent by implementing 2:4 sparsity. However, previous STE-based 2:4 pre-training methods (e.g. STE with hard-thresholding, SR-STE) suffer from optimization difficulties because of discontinuous pruning function. In this study, we comprehensively analyse the bottleneck of traditional N:M sparse training and recognize three drawbacks with discontinuity: incorrect descending direction, inability to predict the amount of descent and sparse mask oscillation. In the light of this statement, we propose S-STE, a simple yet powerful 2:4 training method that contains two parts: to continuously project weights to be 2:4 sparse, and to rescale sparse weights with a per-tensor fixed scaling factor. Besides, we adopt minimum-variance unbiased estimation for activation gradient and FP8 quantization for whole process. Results show that our method surpass previous 2:4 pre-training recipes and is comparable even with full parameter models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09106">Recent Trends in Modelling the Continuous Time Series using Deep Learning: A Survey</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mansura Habiba, Barak A. Pearlmutter, Mehrdad Maleki</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous-time series is essential for different modern application areas, e.g. healthcare, automobile, energy, finance, Internet of things (IoT) and other related areas. Different application needs to process as well as analyse a massive amount of data in time series structure in order to determine the data-driven result, for example, financial trend prediction, potential probability of the occurrence of a particular event occurrence identification, patient health record processing and so many more. However, modeling real-time data using a continuous-time series is challenging since the dynamical systems behind the data could be a differential equation. Several research works have tried to solve the challenges of modelling the continuous-time series using different neural network models and approaches for data processing and learning. The existing deep learning models are not free from challenges and limitations due to diversity among different attributes, behaviour, duration of steps, energy, and data sampling rate. This paper has described the general problem domain of time series and reviewed the challenges of modelling the continuous time series. We have presented a comparative analysis of recent developments in deep learning models and their contribution to solving different difficulties of modelling the continuous time series. We have also identified the limitations of the existing neural network model and open issues. The main goal of this review is to understand the recent trend of neural network models used in a different real-world application with continuous-time data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09108">Trimming the Risk: Towards Reliable Continuous Training for Deep Learning Inspection Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Altaf Allah Abbassi, Houssem Ben Braiek, Foutse Khomh, Thomas Reid</p>
<p>Abstract: The industry increasingly relies on deep learning (DL) technology for manufacturing inspections, which are challenging to automate with rule-based machine vision algorithms. DL-powered inspection systems derive defect patterns from labeled images, combining human-like agility with the consistency of a computerized system. However, finite labeled datasets often fail to encompass all natural variations necessitating Continuous Training (CT) to regularly adjust their models with recent data. Effective CT requires fresh labeled samples from the original distribution; otherwise, selfgenerated labels can lead to silent performance degradation. To mitigate this risk, we develop a robust CT-based maintenance approach that updates DL models using reliable data selections through a two-stage filtering process. The initial stage filters out low-confidence predictions, as the model inherently discredits them. The second stage uses variational auto-encoders and histograms to generate image embeddings that capture latent and pixel characteristics, then rejects the inputs of substantially shifted embeddings as drifted data with erroneous overconfidence. Then, a fine-tuning of the original DL model is executed on the filtered inputs while validating on a mixture of recent production and original datasets. This strategy mitigates catastrophic forgetting and ensures the model adapts effectively to new operational conditions. Evaluations on industrial inspection systems for popsicle stick prints and glass bottles using critical real-world datasets showed less than 9% of erroneous self-labeled data are retained after filtering and used for fine-tuning, improving model performance on production data by up to 14% without compromising its results on original validation data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09111">Neural Message Passing Induced by Energy-Constrained Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Wu, David Wipf, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model as a principled interpretable framework for understanding the mechanism of MPNNs and navigating novel architectural designs. The model, inspired by physical systems, combines the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. As shown by our analysis, the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operated on observed or latent structures. On top of these findings, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed as diffusion-inspired Transformers, whose global attention layers are induced by the principled energy-constrained diffusion. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images and physical particles, we show that the new model can yield promising performance for cases where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed or completely unobserved.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust policies enable reinforcement learning agents to effectively adapt to and operate in unpredictable, dynamic, and ever-changing real-world environments. Factored representations, which break down complex state and action spaces into distinct components, can improve generalization and sample efficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we explore how the curriculum of an agent using a factored state representation affects the robustness of the learned policy. We experimentally demonstrate three simple curricula, such as varying only the variable of highest regret between episodes, that can significantly enhance policy robustness, offering practical insights for reinforcement learning in complex environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dannong Wang, Jintai Chen, Zhiding Liang, Tianfan Fu, Xiao-Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizable molecular design (also known as synthesizable molecular optimization) is a fundamental problem in drug discovery, and involves designing novel molecular structures to improve their properties according to drug-relevant oracle functions (i.e., objective) while ensuring synthetic feasibility. However, existing methods are mostly based on random search. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach using the reinforcement learning method with quantum-inspired simulated annealing policy neural network to navigate the vast discrete space of chemical structures intelligently. Specifically, we employ a deterministic REINFORCE algorithm using policy neural networks to output transitional probability to guide state transitions and local search using genetic algorithm to refine solutions to a local optimum within each iteration. Our methods are evaluated with the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark framework with a 10K query budget. We further showcase the competitive performance of our method by comparing it against the state-of-the-art genetic algorithms-based method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in plan generation. Yet, existing datasets often lack the complexity needed for advanced tool use scenarios - such as handling paraphrased query statements, supporting multiple languages, and managing actions that can be done in parallel. These scenarios are crucial for evaluating the evolving capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. Moreover, current datasets don't enable the study of LLMs from a process perspective, particularly in scenarios where understanding typical behaviors and challenges in executing the same process under different conditions or formulations is crucial. To address these gaps, we present the ProcessTBench dataset, an extension of the TaskBench dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLMs within a process mining framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Lopez, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition is relevant in various domains, ranging from healthcare to human-computer interaction. Physiological signals, being beyond voluntary control, offer reliable information for this purpose, unlike speech and facial expressions which can be controlled at will. They reflect genuine emotional responses, devoid of conscious manipulation, thereby enhancing the credibility of emotion recognition systems. Nonetheless, multimodal emotion recognition with deep learning models remains a relatively unexplored field. In this paper, we introduce a fully hypercomplex network with a hierarchical learning structure to fully capture correlations. Specifically, at the encoder level, the model learns intra-modal relations among the different channels of each input signal. Then, a hypercomplex fusion module learns inter-modal relations among the embeddings of the different modalities. The main novelty is in exploiting intra-modal relations by endowing the encoders with parameterized hypercomplex convolutions (PHCs) that thanks to hypercomplex algebra can capture inter-channel interactions within single modalities. Instead, the fusion module comprises parameterized hypercomplex multiplications (PHMs) that can model inter-modal correlations. The proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art models on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset for emotion recognition, specifically in classifying valence and arousal from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and peripheral physiological signals.

By leveraging hypernetworks and finite basis functions, FB-HyDON effectively mitigates the training limitations associated with existing physics-informed operator learning methods. We validated our approach on the high-frequency harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation at different viscosity levels, and Allen-Cahn equation demonstrating substantial improvements over other operator learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Li, Fulu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a cross-entropy optimization method for hyperparameter optimization in stochastic gradient-based approaches to train deep neural networks. The value of a hyperparameter of a learning algorithm often has great impact on the performance of a model such as the convergence speed, the generalization performance metrics, etc. While in some cases the hyperparameters of a learning algorithm can be part of learning parameters, in other scenarios the hyperparameters of a stochastic optimization algorithm such as Adam [5] and its variants are either fixed as a constant or are kept changing in a monotonic way over time. We give an in-depth analysis of the presented method in the framework of expectation maximization (EM). The presented algorithm of cross-entropy optimization for hyperparameter optimization of a learning algorithm (CEHPO) can be equally applicable to other areas of optimization problems in deep learning. We hope that the presented methods can provide different perspectives and offer some insights for optimization problems in different areas of machine learning and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuesheng Xu, Arielle Carr</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning models and the demand for processing vast amounts of data make the utilization of large-scale distributed systems for efficient training essential. These systems, however, face significant challenges such as communication overhead, hardware limitations, and node failure. This paper investigates various optimization techniques in distributed deep learning, including Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD) and the second-order method AdaHessian. We propose a dynamic weighting strategy to mitigate the problem of straggler nodes due to failure, enhancing the performance and efficiency of the overall training process. We conduct experiments with different numbers of workers and communication periods to demonstrate improved convergence rates and test performance using our strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxi Ye, Grace Chu, Yanfeng Liu, Yichi Zhang, Lukasz Lew, Andrew Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce obstacles to backpropagation. This is particularly challenging when training deep neural networks in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. We propose a novel, robust, and universal solution: a denoising affine transform that stabilizes training under these challenging conditions. By formulating quantization and sparsification as perturbations during training, we derive a perturbation-resilient approach based on ridge regression. Our solution employs a piecewise constant backbone model to ensure a performance lower bound and features an inherent noise reduction mechanism to mitigate perturbation-induced corruption. This formulation allows existing models to be trained at arbitrarily low precision and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes. Furthermore, our method provides a novel perspective on training temporal binary neural networks, contributing to ongoing efforts to narrow the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afshar Shamsi, Rejisa Becirovic, Ahmadreza Argha, Ehsan Abbasnejad, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Arash Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Test time adaptation (TTA) equips deep learning models to handle unseen test data that deviates from the training distribution, even when source data is inaccessible. While traditional TTA methods often rely on entropy as a confidence metric, its effectiveness can be limited, particularly in biased scenarios. Extending existing approaches like the Pseudo Label Probability Difference (PLPD), we introduce ETAGE, a refined TTA method that integrates entropy minimization with gradient norms and PLPD, to enhance sample selection and adaptation. Our method prioritizes samples that are less likely to cause instability by combining high entropy with high gradient norms out of adaptation, thus avoiding the overfitting to noise often observed in previous methods. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing TTA techniques, particularly in challenging and biased scenarios, leading to more robust and consistent model performance across diverse test scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Thuy, Ekaterina Loginova, Dries F. Benoit</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in research on Question Difficulty Estimation (QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Transformer-based neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance, primarily through supervised methods but with an isolated study in unsupervised learning. While supervised methods focus on predictive performance, they require abundant labeled data. On the other hand, unsupervised methods do not require labeled data but rely on a different evaluation metric that is also computationally expensive in practice. This work bridges the research gap by exploring active learning for QDE, a supervised human-in-the-loop approach striving to minimize the labeling efforts while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models. The active learning process iteratively trains on a labeled subset, acquiring labels from human experts only for the most informative unlabeled data points. Furthermore, we propose a novel acquisition function PowerVariance to add the most informative samples to the labeled set, a regression extension to the PowerBALD function popular in classification. We employ DistilBERT for QDE and identify informative samples by applying Monte Carlo dropout to capture epistemic uncertainty in unlabeled samples. The experiments demonstrate that active learning with PowerVariance acquisition achieves a performance close to fully supervised models after labeling only 10% of the training data. The proposed methodology promotes the responsible use of educational resources, makes QDE tools more accessible to course instructors, and is promising for other applications such as personalized support systems and question-answering tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfe Jiao, Xinxun Zhang, Mengzhou Gao, Tianpeng Li, Zhidong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative self-supervised learning (SSL), especially masked autoencoders (MAE), has greatly succeeded and garnered substantial research interest in graph machine learning. However, the research of MAE in dynamic graphs is still scant. This gap is primarily due to the dynamic graph not only possessing topological structure information but also encapsulating temporal evolution dependency. Applying a random masking strategy which most MAE methods adopt to dynamic graphs will remove the crucial subgraph that guides the evolution of dynamic graphs, resulting in the loss of crucial spatio-temporal information in node representations. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Informative Subgraphs Aware Masked Auto-Encoder in Dynamic Graph, namely DyGIS. Specifically, we introduce a constrained probabilistic generative model to generate informative subgraphs that guide the evolution of dynamic graphs, successfully alleviating the issue of missing dynamic evolution subgraphs. The informative subgraph identified by DyGIS will serve as the input of dynamic graph masked autoencoder (DGMAE), effectively ensuring the integrity of the evolutionary spatio-temporal information within dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on eleven datasets demonstrate that DyGIS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Suri, Praneet Dutta, Flora Xue, Ines Azevedo, Ravi Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Zhang, Da Liu, Shengqiang Liu, Anna Wang, Jie Gao, Yali Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has become one of the most impressive approaches for multi-modal representation learning. However, previous multi-modal works mainly focused on cross-modal understanding, ignoring in-modal contrastive learning, which limits the representation of each modality. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning strategy, called $Turbo$, to promote multi-modal understanding by joint in-modal and cross-modal contrastive learning. Specifically, multi-modal data pairs are sent through the forward pass twice with different hidden dropout masks to get two different representations for each modality. With these representations, we obtain multiple in-modal and cross-modal contrastive objectives for training. Finally, we combine the self-supervised Turbo with the supervised multi-modal classification and demonstrate its effectiveness on two audio-text classification tasks, where the state-of-the-art performance is achieved on a speech emotion recognition benchmark dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Matrix Profile (MP), a versatile tool for time series data mining, has been shown effective in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper delves into the problem of anomaly detection in multidimensional time series, a common occurrence in real-world applications. For instance, in a manufacturing factory, multiple sensors installed across the site collect time-varying data for analysis. The Matrix Profile, named for its role in profiling the matrix storing pairwise distance between subsequences of univariate time series, becomes complex in multidimensional scenarios. If the input univariate time series has n subsequences, the pairwise distance matrix is a n x n matrix. In a multidimensional time series with d dimensions, the pairwise distance information must be stored in a n x n x d tensor. In this paper, we first analyze different strategies for condensing this tensor into a profile vector. We then investigate the potential of extending the MP to efficiently find k-nearest neighbors for anomaly detection. Finally, we benchmark the multidimensional MP against 19 baseline methods on 119 multidimensional TSAD datasets. The experiments covers three learning setups: unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised. MP is the only method that consistently delivers high performance across all setups.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09304">Consistent Spectral Clustering in Hyperbolic Spaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagar Ghosh, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering, as an unsupervised technique, plays a pivotal role in various data analysis applications. Among clustering algorithms, Spectral Clustering on Euclidean Spaces has been extensively studied. However, with the rapid evolution of data complexity, Euclidean Space is proving to be inefficient for representing and learning algorithms. Although Deep Neural Networks on hyperbolic spaces have gained recent traction, clustering algorithms or non-deep machine learning models on non-Euclidean Spaces remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a spectral clustering algorithm on Hyperbolic Spaces to address this gap. Hyperbolic Spaces offer advantages in representing complex data structures like hierarchical and tree-like structures, which cannot be embedded efficiently in Euclidean Spaces. Our proposed algorithm replaces the Euclidean Similarity Matrix with an appropriate Hyperbolic Similarity Matrix, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to clustering in Euclidean Spaces. Our contributions include the development of the spectral clustering algorithm on Hyperbolic Spaces and the proof of its weak consistency. We show that our algorithm converges at least as fast as Spectral Clustering on Euclidean Spaces. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we present experimental results on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, highlighting the superior performance of Hyperbolic Spectral Clustering over its Euclidean counterpart. This work opens up avenues for utilizing non-Euclidean Spaces in clustering algorithms, offering new perspectives for handling complex data structures and improving clustering efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin De Bortoli, Iryna Korshunova, Andriy Mnih, Arnaud Doucet</p>
<p>Abstract: Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However, these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for high-dimensional data-rich problems, such as DDM-based Rectified Flow and Schr\"odinger Bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schr\"odinger Bridge, a dynamic entropy-regularised version of OT, that eliminates the need to train multiple DDM-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretisation of a flow of path measures, which we call the Schr\"odinger Bridge Flow, whose only stationary point is the Schr\"odinger Bridge. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Grayeli, Atharva Sehgal, Omar Costilla-Reyes, Miles Cranmer, Swarat Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghwan Kim, Seungkyu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational autoencoder (VAE) is an established generative model but is notorious for its blurriness. In this work, we investigate the blurry output problem of VAE and resolve it, exploiting the variance of Gaussian decoder and $\beta$ of beta-VAE. Specifically, we reveal that the indistinguishability of decoder variance and $\beta$ hinders appropriate analysis of the model by random likelihood value, and limits performance improvement by omitting the gain from $\beta$. To address the problem, we propose Beta-Sigma VAE (BS-VAE) that explicitly separates $\beta$ and decoder variance $\sigma^2_x$ in the model. Our method demonstrates not only superior performance in natural image synthesis but also controllable parameters and predictable analysis compared to conventional VAE. In our experimental evaluation, we employ the analysis of rate-distortion curve and proxy metrics on computer vision datasets. The code is available on https://github.com/overnap/BS-VAE</p>

<p>Abstract: We participated in the KDD CUP 2024 paper source tracing competition and achieved the 3rd place. This competition tasked participants with identifying the reference sources (i.e., ref-sources, as referred to by the organizers of the competition) of given academic papers. Unlike most teams that addressed this challenge by fine-tuning pre-trained neural language models such as BERT or ChatGLM, our primary approach utilized closed-source large language models (LLMs). With recent advancements in LLM technology, closed-source LLMs have demonstrated the capability to tackle complex reasoning tasks in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. Consequently, in the absence of GPUs, we employed closed-source LLMs to directly generate predicted reference sources from the provided papers. We further refined these predictions through ensemble learning. Notably, our method was the only one among the award-winning approaches that did not require the use of GPUs for model training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangyu Li, Yang Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: As global climate change intensifies, accurate weather forecasting is increasingly crucial for sectors such as agriculture, energy management, and environmental protection. Traditional methods, which rely on physical and statistical models, often struggle with complex, nonlinear, and time-varying data, underscoring the need for more advanced techniques. This study explores a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to enhance temperature forecasting accuracy for the Delhi region, using historical meteorological data from 1996 to 2017. We employed both direct and indirect methods, including comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, to construct and train our model. The CNN component effectively extracts spatial features, while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods in terms of both accuracy and stability, with a mean square error (MSE) of 3.26217 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.80615. The hybrid model demonstrates its potential as a robust tool for temperature prediction, offering valuable insights for meteorological forecasting and related fields. Future research should focus on optimizing model architecture, exploring additional feature extraction techniques, and addressing challenges such as overfitting and computational complexity. This approach not only advances temperature forecasting but also provides a foundation for applying deep learning to other time series forecasting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Yang Xu, Lei Gong, Ye Zhu, Kai Ming Ting</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for clustering in a distributed network called Distributed Clustering based on Distributional Kernel (K) or KDC that produces the final clusters based on the similarity with respect to the distributions of initial clusters, as measured by K. It is the only framework that satisfies all three of the following properties. First, KDC guarantees that the combined clustering outcome from all sites is equivalent to the clustering outcome of its centralized counterpart from the combined dataset from all sites. Second, the maximum runtime cost of any site in distributed mode is smaller than the runtime cost in centralized mode. Third, it is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed clustering framework that employs a distributional kernel. The distribution-based clustering leads directly to significantly better clustering outcomes than existing methods of distributed clustering. In addition, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Kernel Bounded Cluster Cores, which is the best clustering algorithm applied to KDC among existing clustering algorithms. We also show that KDC is a generic framework that enables a quadratic time clustering algorithm to deal with large datasets that would otherwise be impossible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Huang, Sofoklis Kitharidis, Thomas B\"ack, Niki van Stein</p>
<p>Abstract: In time-series classification, understanding model decisions is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.</p>

Moreover, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that uses the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Clinton, Robert Lieck</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning approaches to offline reinforcement learning, particularly those utilizing the Decision Transformer, have shown effectiveness in continuous environments and for sparse rewards. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to the high compounding error of auto-regressive models. To overcome this limitation, we go beyond next-token prediction and introduce Planning Tokens, which contain high-level, long time-scale information about the agent's future. Predicting dual time-scale tokens at regular intervals enables our model to use these long-horizon Planning Tokens as a form of implicit planning to guide its low-level policy and reduce compounding error. This architectural modification significantly enhances performance on long-horizon tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art in complex D4RL environments. Additionally, we demonstrate that Planning Tokens improve the interpretability of the model's policy through the interpretable plan visualisations and attention map.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Yuan Wu, Frank E. Curtis, Daniel P. Robinson</p>
<p>Abstract: To address unfairness issues in federated learning (FL), contemporary approaches typically use frequent model parameter updates and transmissions between the clients and server. In such a process, client-specific information (e.g., local dataset size or data-related fairness metrics) must be sent to the server to compute, e.g., aggregation weights. All of this results in high transmission costs and the potential leakage of client information. As an alternative, we propose a strategy that promotes fair predictions across clients without the need to pass information between the clients and server iteratively and prevents client data leakage. For each client, we first use their local dataset to obtain a synthetic dataset by solving a bilevel optimization problem that addresses unfairness concerns during the learning process. We then pass each client's synthetic dataset to the server, the collection of which is used to train the server model using conventional machine learning techniques (that do not take fairness metrics into account). Thus, we eliminate the need to handle fairness-specific aggregation weights while preserving client privacy. Our approach requires only a single communication between the clients and the server, thus making it computationally cost-effective, able to maintain privacy, and able to ensuring fairness. We present empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The results illustrate that our method effectively uses synthetic data as a means to mitigate unfairness and preserve client privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabi Prezja</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) research and application often involve time-consuming steps such as model architecture prototyping, feature selection, and dataset preparation. To support these tasks, we introduce the Deep Fast Machine Learning Utils (DFMLU) library, which provides tools designed to automate and enhance aspects of these processes. Compatible with frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn, DFMLU offers functionalities that support model development and data handling. The library includes methods for dense neural network search, advanced feature selection, and utilities for data management and visualization of training outcomes. This manuscript presents an overview of DFMLU's functionalities, providing Python examples for each tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Hao Li, Niraj K. Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable medical sensors (WMSs) are revolutionizing smart healthcare by enabling continuous, real-time monitoring of user physiological signals, especially in the field of consumer healthcare. The integration of WMSs and modern machine learning (ML) enables unprecedented solutions to efficient early-stage disease detection. Despite the success of Transformers in various fields, their application to sensitive domains, such as smart healthcare, remains underexplored due to limited data accessibility and privacy concerns. To bridge the gap between Transformer-based foundation models and WMS-based disease detection, we propose COMFORT, a continual fine-tuning framework for foundation models targeted at consumer healthcare. COMFORT introduces a novel approach for pre-training a Transformer-based foundation model on a large dataset of physiological signals exclusively collected from healthy individuals with commercially available WMSs. We adopt a masked data modeling (MDM) objective to pre-train this health foundation model. We then fine-tune the model using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to adapt it to various downstream disease detection tasks that rely on WMS data. In addition, COMFORT continually stores the low-rank decomposition matrices obtained from the PEFT algorithms to construct a library for multi-disease detection. The COMFORT library enables scalable and memory-efficient disease detection on edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that COMFORT achieves highly competitive performance while reducing memory overhead by up to 52% relative to conventional methods. Thus, COMFORT paves the way for personalized and proactive solutions to efficient and effective early-stage disease detection for consumer healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ka Nam Canaan Law, Mingshuo Yu, Lianglei Zhang, Yiyi Zhang, Peng Xu, Jerry Gao, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality control of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is paramount in advancing electronic device technology. While numerous machine learning methodologies have been utilized to augment defect detection efficiency and accuracy, previous studies have predominantly focused on optimizing individual models for specific defect types, often overlooking the potential synergies between different approaches. This paper introduces a comprehensive inspection framework leveraging an ensemble learning strategy to address this gap. Initially, we utilize four distinct PCB defect detection models utilizing state-of-the-art methods: EfficientDet, MobileNet SSDv2, Faster RCNN, and YOLOv5. Each method is capable of identifying PCB defects independently. Subsequently, we integrate these models into an ensemble learning framework to enhance detection performance. A comparative analysis reveals that our ensemble learning framework significantly outperforms individual methods, achieving a 95% accuracy in detecting diverse PCB defects. These findings underscore the efficacy of our proposed ensemble learning framework in enhancing PCB quality control processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Kuchlous, Marvin Li, Jeffrey G. Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing adoption of Text-to-Image (TTI) systems, the social biases of these models have come under increased scrutiny. Herein we conduct a systematic investigation of one such source of bias for diffusion models: embedding spaces. First, because traditional classifier-based fairness definitions require true labels not present in generative modeling, we propose statistical group fairness criteria based on a model's internal representation of the world. Using these definitions, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that an unbiased text embedding space for input prompts is a necessary condition for representationally balanced diffusion models, meaning the distribution of generated images satisfy diversity requirements with respect to protected attributes. Next, we investigate the impact of biased embeddings on evaluating the alignment between generated images and prompts, a process which is commonly used to assess diffusion models. We find that biased multimodal embeddings like CLIP can result in lower alignment scores for representationally balanced TTI models, thus rewarding unfair behavior. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework through which biases in alignment evaluation can be studied and propose bias mitigation methods. By specifically adapting the perspective of embedding spaces, we establish new fairness conditions for diffusion model development and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houcheng Su, Mengzhu Wang, Jiao Li, Bingli Wang, Daixian Liu, Zeheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional test-time training (TTT) methods, while addressing domain shifts, often assume a consistent class set, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios characterized by infinite variety. Open-World Test-Time Training (OWTTT) addresses the challenge of generalizing deep learning models to unknown target domain distributions, especially in the presence of strong Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Existing TTT methods often struggle to maintain performance when confronted with strong OOD data. In OWTTT, the focus has predominantly been on distinguishing between overall strong and weak OOD data. However, during the early stages of TTT, initial feature extraction is hampered by interference from strong OOD and corruptions, resulting in diminished contrast and premature classification of certain classes as strong OOD. To address this, we introduce Open World Dynamic Contrastive Learning (OWDCL), an innovative approach that utilizes contrastive learning to augment positive sample pairs. This strategy not only bolsters contrast in the early stages but also significantly enhances model robustness in subsequent stages. In comparison datasets, our OWDCL model has produced the most advanced performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingwei Meng, Zongren Zou, J\'er\^ome Darbon, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The interplay between stochastic processes and optimal control has been extensively explored in the literature. With the recent surge in the use of diffusion models, stochastic processes have increasingly been applied to sample generation. This paper builds on the log transform, known as the Cole-Hopf transform in Brownian motion contexts, and extends it within a more abstract framework that includes a linear operator. Within this framework, we found that the well-known relationship between the Cole-Hopf transform and optimal transport is a particular instance where the linear operator acts as the infinitesimal generator of a stochastic process. We also introduce a novel scenario where the linear operator is the adjoint of the generator, linking to Bayesian inference under specific initial and terminal conditions. Leveraging this theoretical foundation, we develop a new algorithm, named the HJ-sampler, for Bayesian inference for the inverse problem of a stochastic differential equation with given terminal observations. The HJ-sampler involves two stages: (1) solving the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations, and (2) sampling from the associated stochastic optimal control problem. Our proposed algorithm naturally allows for flexibility in selecting the numerical solver for viscous HJ PDEs. We introduce two variants of the solver: the Riccati-HJ-sampler, based on the Riccati method, and the SGM-HJ-sampler, which utilizes diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods by applying them to solve Bayesian inverse problems involving various stochastic processes and prior distributions, including applications that address model misspecifications and quantifying model uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Ren, Danica J. Sutherland</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining compositional mappings is important for the model to generalize well compositionally. To better understand when and how to encourage the model to learn such mappings, we study their uniqueness through different perspectives. Specifically, we first show that the compositional mappings are the simplest bijections through the lens of coding length (i.e., an upper bound of their Kolmogorov complexity). This property explains why models having such mappings can generalize well. We further show that the simplicity bias is usually an intrinsic property of neural network training via gradient descent. That partially explains why some models spontaneously generalize well when they are trained appropriately.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus Barreda, Ashley Gomez, Ruben Puga, Kaixiong Zhou, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series classification is an important task with widespread domains of applications. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series classification. However, they often require large expert-labeled training datasets which can be infeasible in practice. In few-shot settings, i.e. only a limited number of samples per class are available in training data, DNNs show a significant drop in testing accuracy and poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose to address these problems from an optimization and a loss function perspective. Specifically, we propose a new learning framework named COSCO consisting of a sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization and a Prototypical loss function to improve the generalization ability of DNN for multivariate time series classification problems under few-shot setting. Our experiments demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/JRB9/COSCO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haihong Guo, Fengxin Li, Jiao Li, Hongyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is an emerging neural network architecture in machine learning. It has greatly interested the research community about whether KAN can be a promising alternative of the commonly used Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLP). Experiments in various fields demonstrated that KAN-based machine learning can achieve comparable if not better performance than MLP-based methods, but with much smaller parameter scales and are more explainable. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of KAN into the actor and critic networks for offline reinforcement learning (RL). We evaluated the performance, parameter scales, and training efficiency of various KAN and MLP based conservative Q-learning (CQL) on the the classical D4RL benchmark for offline RL. Our study demonstrates that KAN can achieve performance close to the commonly used MLP with significantly fewer parameters. This provides us an option to choose the base networks according to the requirements of the offline RL tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Hajiani, Babak Seyfe</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to select the best model of the data. Based on the exclusive properties of the nested models, we find the most parsimonious model containing the risk minimizer predictor. We prove the existence of probable approximately correct (PAC) bounds on the difference of the minimum empirical risk of two successive nested models, called successive empirical excess risk (SEER). Based on these bounds, we propose a model order selection method called nested empirical risk (NER). By the sorted NER (S-NER) method to sort the models intelligently, the minimum risk decreases. We construct a test that predicts whether expanding the model decreases the minimum risk or not. With a high probability, the NER and S-NER choose the true model order and the most parsimonious model containing the risk minimizer predictor, respectively. We use S-NER model selection in the linear regression and show that, the S-NER method without any prior information can outperform the accuracy of feature sorting algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that aided with prior knowledge of the true model order. Also, in the UCR data set, the NER method reduces the complexity of the classification of UCR datasets dramatically, with a negligible loss of accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Fill, Michael Eichelbeck, Michael Ebner</p>
<p>Abstract: Building-specific knowledge such as building type and function information is important for numerous energy applications. However, comprehensive datasets containing this information for individual households are missing in many regions of Europe. For the first time, we investigate whether it is feasible to predict building types and functional classes at a European scale based on only open GIS datasets available across countries. We train a graph neural network (GNN) classifier on a large-scale graph dataset consisting of OpenStreetMap (OSM) buildings across the EU, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK. To efficiently perform training using the large-scale graph, we utilize localized subgraphs. A graph transformer model achieves a high Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.754 when classifying buildings into 9 classes, and a very high Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.844 when classifying buildings into the residential and non-residential classes. The experimental results imply three core novel contributions to literature. Firstly, we show that building classification across multiple countries is possible using a multi-source dataset consisting of information about 2D building shape, land use, degree of urbanization, and countries as input, and OSM tags as ground truth. Secondly, our results indicate that GNN models that consider contextual information about building neighborhoods improve predictive performance compared to models that only consider individual buildings and ignore the neighborhood. Thirdly, we show that training with GNNs on localized subgraphs instead of standard GNNs improves performance for the task of building classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Pandey, Gopeshh Subbaraj, Emmanuel Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), a class of generative models have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from unnormalized reward distributions. Previous works in this direction often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using offline drug-like molecule datasets, which conditions A-GFNs on inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further our method by implementing a goal-conditioned fine-tuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on the ZINC15 offline dataset and employ robust evaluation metrics to show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods in drug design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Sam, Devin Willmott, Joao D. Semedo, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP are trained via contrastive learning between text and image pairs, resulting in aligned image and text embeddings that are useful for many downstream tasks. A notable drawback of CLIP, however, is that the resulting embedding space seems to lack some of the structure of their purely text-based alternatives. For instance, while text embeddings have been long noted to satisfy \emph{analogies} in embedding space using vector arithmetic, CLIP has no such property. In this paper, we propose an approach to natively train CLIP in a contrastive manner to reason about differences in embedding space. We finetune CLIP so that the differences in image embedding space correspond to \emph{text descriptions of the image differences}, which we synthetically generate with large language models on image-caption paired datasets. We first demonstrate that our approach yields significantly improved capabilities in ranking images by a certain attribute (e.g., elephants are larger than cats), which is useful in retrieval or constructing attribute-based classifiers, and improved zeroshot classification performance on many downstream image classification tasks. In addition, our approach enables a new mechanism for inference that we refer to as comparative prompting, where we leverage prior knowledge of text descriptions of differences between classes of interest, achieving even larger performance gains in classification. Finally, we illustrate that the resulting embeddings obey a larger degree of geometric properties in embedding space, such as in text-to-image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning holds great potential for enabling large-scale healthcare research and collaboration across multiple centres while ensuring data privacy and security are not compromised. Although numerous recent studies suggest or utilize federated learning based methods in healthcare, it remains unclear which ones have potential clinical utility. This review paper considers and analyzes the most recent studies up to May 2024 that describe federated learning based methods in healthcare. After a thorough review, we find that the vast majority are not appropriate for clinical use due to their methodological flaws and/or underlying biases which include but are not limited to privacy concerns, generalization issues, and communication costs. As a result, the effectiveness of federated learning in healthcare is significantly compromised. To overcome these challenges, we provide recommendations and promising opportunities that might be implemented to resolve these problems and improve the quality of model development in federated learning with healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous and occur naturally in a variety of applications -- from data recorded by sensors in manufacturing processes, over financial data streams to climate data. Different tasks arise, such as regression, classification or segmentation of the time series. However, to reliably solve these challenges, it is important to filter out abnormal observations that deviate from the usual behavior of the time series. While many anomaly detection methods exist for independent data and stationary time series, these methods are not applicable to non-stationary time series. To allow for non-stationarity in the data, while simultaneously detecting anomalies, we propose OML-AD, a novel approach for anomaly detection (AD) based on online machine learning (OML). We provide an implementation of OML-AD within the Python library River and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haihan Zhang, Yuanshi Liu, Qianwen Chen, Cong Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a widely used algorithm in machine learning, particularly for neural network training. Recent studies on SGD for canonical quadratic optimization or linear regression show it attains well generalization under suitable high-dimensional settings. However, a fundamental question -- for what kinds of high-dimensional learning problems SGD and its accelerated variants can achieve optimality has yet to be well studied. This paper investigates SGD with two essential components in practice: exponentially decaying step size schedule and momentum. We establish the convergence upper bound for momentum accelerated SGD (ASGD) and propose concrete classes of learning problems under which SGD or ASGD achieves min-max optimal convergence rates. The characterization of the target function is based on standard power-law decays in (functional) linear regression. Our results unveil new insights for understanding the learning bias of SGD: (i) SGD is efficient in learning ``dense'' features where the corresponding weights are subject to an infinity norm constraint; (ii) SGD is efficient for easy problem without suffering from the saturation effect; (iii) momentum can accelerate the convergence rate by order when the learning problem is relatively hard. To our knowledge, this is the first work to clearly identify the optimal boundary of SGD versus ASGD for the problem under mild settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lecheng Zheng, John R. Birge, Yifang Zhang, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection on graphs plays an important role in many real-world applications. Usually, these data are composed of multiple types (e.g., user information and transaction records for financial data), thus exhibiting view heterogeneity. Therefore, it can be challenging to leverage such multi-view information and learn the graph's contextual information to identify rare anomalies. To tackle this problem, many deep learning-based methods utilize contrastive learning loss as a regularization term to learn good representations. However, many existing contrastive-based methods show that traditional contrastive learning losses fail to consider the semantic information (e.g., class membership information). In addition, we theoretically show that clustering-based contrastive learning also easily leads to a sub-optimal solution. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an autoencoder-based clustering framework regularized by a similarity-guided contrastive loss to detect anomalous nodes. Specifically, we build a similarity map to help the model learn robust representations without imposing a hard margin constraint between the positive and negative pairs. Theoretically, we show that the proposed similarity-guided loss is a variant of contrastive learning loss, and how it alleviates the issue of unreliable pseudo-labels with the connection to graph spectral clustering. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqiao Mu, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to efficiently remove data from a model without retraining it from scratch, in order to enforce data privacy, remove corrupted or outdated data, or respect a user's ``right to be forgotten." Certified machine unlearning is a strong theoretical guarantee that quantifies the extent to which data is erased from the model weights. Most prior works in certified unlearning focus on models trained on convex or strongly convex loss functions, which benefit from convenient convergence guarantees and the existence of global minima. For nonconvex objectives, existing algorithms rely on limiting assumptions and expensive computations that hinder practical implementations. In this work, we propose a simple first-order algorithm for unlearning on general nonconvex loss functions which unlearns by ``rewinding" to an earlier step during the learning process and then performs gradient descent on the loss function of the retained data points. Our algorithm is black-box, in that it can be directly applied to models pretrained with vanilla gradient descent with no prior consideration of unlearning. We prove $(\epsilon, \delta)$ certified unlearning and performance guarantees that establish the privacy-utility-complexity tradeoff of our algorithm, with special consideration for nonconvex functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality.</p>

The proposed approach is compared with the popular HyperOpt technique used extensively for hyperparameter optimization and the recently developed bandit-based algorithm BLiE. The results for multiple neural network architectures indicate that our method finds a better learning rate using a) fewer evaluations and b) lesser number of epochs per evaluation, when compared to both HyperOpt and BLiE. Thus, the proposed approach enables more efficient training of neural networks, leading to lower training time and lesser computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> RuiKang OuYang, Bo Qiang, Jos\'e Miguel Hern\'andez-Lobato</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, ENERGY-BASED DENOISING ENERGY MATCHING, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to EnDEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate EnDEM and BEnDEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-welling potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BEnDEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Sun, Zixuan Qin, Shun Zhang, Yuexian Wang, Li Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the financial risk domain, particularly in credit default prediction and fraud detection, accurate identification of high-risk class instances is paramount, as their occurrence can have significant economic implications. Although machine learning models have gained widespread adoption for risk prediction, their performance is often hindered by the scarcity and diversity of high-quality data. This limitation stems from factors in datasets such as small risk sample sizes, high labeling costs, and severe class imbalance, which impede the models' ability to learn effectively and accurately forecast critical events. This study investigates data pre-processing techniques to enhance existing financial risk datasets by introducing TriEnhance, a straightforward technique that entails: (1) generating synthetic samples specifically tailored to the minority class, (2) filtering using binary feedback to refine samples, and (3) self-learning with pseudo-labels. Our experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal the efficacy of TriEnhance, with a notable focus on improving minority class calibration, a key factor for developing more robust financial risk prediction systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liu, Jingmin Sun, Xinjie He, Griffin Pinney, Zecheng Zhang, Hayden Schaeffer</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose PROSE-FD, a zero-shot multimodal PDE foundational model for simultaneous prediction of heterogeneous two-dimensional physical systems related to distinct fluid dynamics settings. These systems include shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes equations with incompressible and compressible flow, regular and complex geometries, and different buoyancy settings. This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories. Our model outperforms popular operator learning, computer vision, and multi-physics models, in benchmark forward prediction tasks. We test our architecture choices with ablation studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Chang Bakker, Shashank Gupta, Harrie Oosterhuis</p>
<p>Abstract: Variance regularized counterfactual risk minimization (VRCRM) has been proposed as an alternative off-policy learning (OPL) method. VRCRM method uses a lower-bound on the $f$-divergence between the logging policy and the target policy as regularization during learning and was shown to improve performance over existing OPL alternatives on multi-label classification tasks. In this work, we revisit the original experimental setting of VRCRM and propose to minimize the $f$-divergence directly, instead of optimizing for the lower bound using a $f$-GAN approach. Surprisingly, we were unable to reproduce the results reported in the original setting. In response, we propose a novel simpler alternative to f-divergence optimization by minimizing a direct approximation of f-divergence directly, instead of a $f$-GAN based lower bound. Experiments showed that minimizing the divergence using $f$-GANs did not work as expected, whereas our proposed novel simpler alternative works better empirically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Huang, Yukang Yang, Kaidi Fu, Yanyi Chu, Le Cong, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and optimizing discrete RNA sequences. RNA is a particularly dynamic and versatile molecule in biological processes. RNA sequences exhibit high variability and diversity, characterized by their variable lengths, flexible three-dimensional structures, and diverse functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to encode raw RNAs into token-level biologically meaningful representations. A Q-Former is employed to compress these representations into a fixed-length set of latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we train reward networks to estimate functional properties of RNA from the latent variables. We employ gradient-based guidance during the backward diffusion process, aiming to generate RNA sequences that are optimized for higher rewards. Empirical experiments confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with natural distributions across various biological indicators. We fine-tuned the diffusion model on untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA and optimize sample sequences for protein translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model effectively generates diverse UTR sequences with high Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), surpassing baselines. These results hold promise for studies on RNA sequence-function relationships, protein synthesis, and enhancing therapeutic RNA design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph machine learning (GML) has been successfully applied across a wide range of tasks. Nonetheless, GML faces significant challenges in generalizing over out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which raises concerns about its wider applicability. Recent advancements have underscored the crucial role of causality-driven approaches in overcoming these generalization challenges. Distinct from traditional GML methods that primarily rely on statistical dependencies, causality-focused strategies delve into the underlying causal mechanisms of data generation and model prediction, thus significantly improving the generalization of GML across different environments. This paper offers a thorough review of recent progress in causality-involved GML generalization. We elucidate the fundamental concepts of employing causality to enhance graph model generalization and categorize the various approaches, providing detailed descriptions of their methodologies and the connections among them. Furthermore, we explore the incorporation of causality in other related important areas of trustworthy GML, such as explanation, fairness, and robustness. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions, this review seeks to articulate the continuing development and future potential of causality in enhancing the trustworthiness of graph machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address three key challenges in learning continuous kernel representations: computational efficiency, parameter efficiency, and spectral bias. Continuous kernels have shown significant potential, but their practical adoption is often limited by high computational and memory demands. Additionally, these methods are prone to spectral bias, which impedes their ability to capture high-frequency details. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages sparse learning in the Fourier domain. Our method enables the efficient scaling of continuous kernels, drastically reduces computational and memory requirements, and mitigates spectral bias by exploiting the Gibbs phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Gupta, Harrie Oosterhuis, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) can be risky and, in various circumstances, can produce sub-optimal models that hurt performance when deployed. Safe CLTR was introduced to mitigate these risks when using inverse propensity scoring to correct for position bias. However, the existing safety measure for CLTR is not applicable to state-of-the-art CLTR methods, cannot handle trust bias, and relies on specific assumptions about user behavior. We propose a novel approach, proximal ranking policy optimization (PRPO), that provides safety in deployment without assumptions about user behavior. PRPO removes incentives for learning ranking behavior that is too dissimilar to a safe ranking model. Thereby, PRPO imposes a limit on how much learned models can degrade performance metrics, without relying on any specific user assumptions. Our experiments show that PRPO provides higher performance than the existing safe inverse propensity scoring approach. PRPO always maintains safety, even in maximally adversarial situations. By avoiding assumptions, PRPO is the first method with unconditional safety in deployment that translates to robust safety for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhe Bai, Camelia Constantin, Hubert Naacke</p>
<p>Abstract: In the area of large-scale training of graph embeddings, effective training frameworks and partitioning methods are critical for handling large networks. However, they face two major challenges: 1) existing synchronized distributed frameworks require continuous communication to access information from other machines, and 2) the inability of current partitioning methods to ensure that subgraphs remain connected components without isolated nodes, which is essential for effective training of GNNs since training relies on information aggregation from neighboring nodes. To address these issues, we introduce a novel partitioning method, named Leiden-Fusion, designed for large-scale training of graphs with minimal communication. Our method extends the Leiden community detection algorithm with a greedy algorithm that merges the smallest communities with highly connected neighboring communities. Our method guarantees that, for an initially connected graph, each partition is a densely connected subgraph with no isolated nodes. After obtaining the partitions, we train a GNN for each partition independently, and finally integrate all embeddings for node classification tasks, which significantly reduces the need for network communication and enhances the efficiency of distributed graph training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets, achieving high efficiency while preserving the quality of the graph embeddings for node classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qincheng Lu, Jiaqi Zhu, Sitao Luan, Xiao-Wen Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture long-range and global topology information is limited by the scope of conventional graph Laplacian, leading to unsatisfactory performance on some datasets, particularly on heterophilic graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a new class of parameterized Laplacian matrices, which provably offers more flexibility in controlling the diffusion distance between nodes than the conventional graph Laplacian, allowing long-range information to be adaptively captured through diffusion on graph. Specifically, we first prove that the diffusion distance and spectral distance on graph have an order-preserving relationship. With this result, we demonstrate that the parameterized Laplacian can accelerate the diffusion of long-range information, and the parameters in the Laplacian enable flexibility of the diffusion scopes. Based on the theoretical results, we propose topology-guided rewiring mechanism to capture helpful long-range neighborhood information for heterophilic graphs. With this mechanism and the new Laplacian, we propose two GNNs with flexible diffusion scopes: namely the Parameterized Diffusion based Graph Convolutional Networks (PD-GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (PD-GAT). Synthetic experiments reveal the high correlations between the parameters of the new Laplacian and the performance of parameterized GNNs under various graph homophily levels, which verifies that our new proposed GNNs indeed have the ability to adjust the parameters to adaptively capture the global information for different levels of heterophilic graphs. They also outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on 6 out of 7 real-world benchmark datasets, which further confirms their superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Dong, Jianhua Yao, Jiajing Wang, Yingbin Liang, Shuhan Liao, Minheng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial fraud refers to the act of obtaining financial benefits through dishonest means. Such behavior not only disrupts the order of the financial market but also harms economic and social development and breeds other illegal and criminal activities. With the popularization of the internet and online payment methods, many fraudulent activities and money laundering behaviors in life have shifted from offline to online, posing a great challenge to regulatory authorities. How to efficiently detect these financial fraud activities has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Graph neural networks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive relationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the field of fraud detection. However, there are still some issues. First, fraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction transfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud detection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which can have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition, existing research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor information and central node information. For example, when the central node has too many neighbors, the features of the central node itself are often neglected. Finally, fraud activities and patterns are constantly changing over time, so considering the dynamic evolution of graph edge relationships is also very important.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894">Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyon Vafa, Susan Athey, David M. Blei</p>
<p>Abstract: One thread of empirical work in social science focuses on decomposing group differences in outcomes into unexplained components and components explained by observable factors. In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which require estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple summaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot take advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting decompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates that are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model. Here we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that employs powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the predictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from complex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model, designed to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender wage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still lead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this issue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple models and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel set of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a fine-tuned foundation model is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory, we then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing OVB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungang Chen, Eduardo Gildin, John Killough</p>
<p>Abstract: Reduced-order models, also known as proxy model or surrogate model, are approximate models that are less computational expensive as opposed to fully descriptive models. With the integration of machine learning, these models have garnered increasing research interests recently. However, many existing reduced-order modeling methods, such as embed to control (E2C) and embed to control and observe (E2CO), fall short in long-term predictions due to the accumulation of prediction errors over time. This issue arises partly from the one-step prediction framework inherent in E2C and E2CO architectures. This paper introduces a deep learning-based surrogate model, referred as multi-step embed-to-control model, for the construction of proxy models with improved long-term prediction performance. Unlike E2C and E2CO, the proposed network considers multiple forward transitions in the latent space at a time using Koopman operator, allowing the model to incorporate a sequence of state snapshots during training phrases. Additionally, the loss function of this novel approach has been redesigned to accommodate these multiple transitions and to respect the underlying physical principles. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, the developed framework was implemented within two-phase (oil and water) reservoir model under a waterflooding scheme. Comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional E2C model in long-term simulation scenarios. Notably, there was a substantial reduction in temporal errors in the prediction of saturation profiles and a decent improvement in pressure forecasting accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kohei Obata, Koki Kawabata, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series data suffer from the problem of missing values, which hinders the application of many analytical methods. To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) promise to offer a computationally efficient alternative to ab initio simulations for complex molecular systems. However, ensuring their generalizability beyond training data is crucial for their wide application in studying solid materials. This work investigates the ability of a graph neural network (GNN)-based MLFF, trained on Lennard-Jones Argon, to describe solid-state phenomena not explicitly included during training. We assess the MLFF's performance in predicting phonon density of states (PDOS) for a perfect face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at both zero and finite temperatures. Additionally, we evaluate vacancy migration rates and energy barriers in an imperfect crystal using direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the string method. Notably, vacancy configurations were absent from the training data. Our results demonstrate the MLFF's capability to capture essential solid-state properties with good agreement to reference data, even for unseen configurations. We further discuss data engineering strategies to enhance the generalizability of MLFFs. The proposed set of benchmark tests and workflow for evaluating MLFF performance in describing perfect and imperfect crystals pave the way for reliable application of MLFFs in studying complex solid-state materials.</p>

<p>Abstract: Induction motors are one of the most crucial electrical equipment and are extensively used in industries in a wide range of applications. This paper presents a machine learning model for the fault detection and classification of induction motor faults by using three phase voltages and currents as inputs. The aim of this work is to protect vital electrical components and to prevent abnormal event progression through early detection and diagnosis. This work presents a fast forward artificial neural network model to detect some of the commonly occurring electrical faults like overvoltage, under voltage, single phasing, unbalanced voltage, overload, ground fault. A separate model free monitoring system wherein the motor itself acts like a sensor is presented and the only monitored signals are the input given to the motor. Limits for current and voltage values are set for the faulty and healthy conditions, which is done by a classifier. Real time data from a 0.33 HP induction motor is used to train and test the neural network. The model so developed analyses the voltage and current values given at a particular instant and classifies the data into no fault or the specific fault. The model is then interfaced with a real motor to accurately detect and classify the faults so that further necessary action can be taken.</p>

We propose a new method, optimal ablation (OA), and show that OA-based component importance has theoretical and empirical advantages over measuring importance via other ablation methods.

<p>Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify unusual graph instances (nodes, edges, subgraphs, or graphs), has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its significance in a wide range of applications. Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open problems to inspire more future high-quality research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Lin, Zongkai Liu, Danying Mo, Chao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) research, which aims to balance multiple objectives by incorporating preferences for each objective. In most existing studies, specific preferences must be provided during deployment to indicate the desired policies explicitly. However, designing these preferences depends heavily on human prior knowledge, which is typically obtained through extensive observation of high-performing demonstrations with expected behaviors. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective offline adaptation framework for multi-objective RL problems without assuming handcrafted target preferences, but only given several demonstrations to implicitly indicate the preferences of expected policies. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework can naturally be extended to meet constraints on safety-critical objectives by utilizing safe demonstrations, even when the safety thresholds are unknown. Empirical results on offline multi-objective and safe tasks demonstrate the capability of our framework to infer policies that align with real preferences while meeting the constraints implied by the provided demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salloni Kapoor, Simeon Sayer</p>
<p>Abstract: Hunger crises are critical global issues affecting millions, particularly in low-income and developing countries. This research investigates how machine learning can be utilized to predict and inform decisions regarding famine and hunger crises. By leveraging a diverse set of variables (natural, economic, and conflict-related), three machine learning models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, and RandomForestRegressor) were employed to predict food consumption scores, a key indicator of household nutrition. The RandomForestRegressor emerged as the most accurate model, with an average prediction error of 10.6%, though accuracy varied significantly across countries, ranging from 2% to over 30%. Notably, economic indicators were consistently the most significant predictors of average household nutrition, while no single feature dominated across all regions, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive data collection and tailored, country-specific models. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning, particularly Random Forests, to enhance famine prediction, suggesting that continued research and improved data gathering are essential for more effective global hunger forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hinata Harada, Hideaki Iiduka</p>
<p>Abstract: The sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm and its variants, including gap guided SAM (GSAM), have been successful at improving the generalization capability of deep neural network models by finding flat local minima of the empirical loss in training. Meanwhile, it has been shown theoretically and practically that increasing the batch size or decaying the learning rate avoids sharp local minima of the empirical loss. In this paper, we consider the GSAM algorithm with increasing batch sizes or decaying learning rates, such as cosine annealing or linear learning rate, and theoretically show its convergence. Moreover, we numerically compare SAM (GSAM) with and without an increasing batch size and conclude that using an increasing batch size or decaying learning rate finds flatter local minima than using a constant batch size and learning rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amogh Joshi, Adarsh Kumar Kosta, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.</p>

Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charbel Bou Chaaya, Abanoub M. Girgis, Mehdi Bennis</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel data-driven machine learning (ML) technique to model and predict the dynamics of the wireless propagation environment in latent space. Leveraging the idea of channel charting, which learns compressed representations of high-dimensional channel state information (CSI), we incorporate a predictive component to capture the dynamics of the wireless system. Hence, we jointly learn a channel encoder that maps the estimated CSI to an appropriate latent space, and a predictor that models the relationships between such representations. Accordingly, our problem boils down to training a joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) that simulates the latent dynamics of a wireless network from CSI. We present numerical evaluations on measured data and show that the proposed JEPA displays a two-fold increase in accuracy over benchmarks, for longer look-ahead prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Assaf Shmuel, Teddy Lazebnik, Oren Glickman, Eyal Heifetz, Colin Price</p>
<p>Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant natural disaster risk to populations and contribute to accelerated climate change. As wildfires are also affected by climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities, lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation. Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and lightning-ignited wildfires. Moreover, we demonstrate that, even over a short time span of less than a decade, climate changes have steadily increased the global risk of lightning-ignited wildfires. This distinction underscores the imperative need for dedicated predictive models and fire weather indices tailored specifically to each type of wildfire.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Cavallo, Mohammad Sabbaqi, Elvin Isufi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling spatiotemporal interactions in multivariate time series is key to their effective processing, but challenging because of their irregular and often unknown structure. Statistical properties of the data provide useful biases to model interdependencies and are leveraged by correlation and covariance-based networks as well as by processing pipelines relying on principal component analysis (PCA). However, PCA and its temporal extensions suffer instabilities in the covariance eigenvectors when the corresponding eigenvalues are close to each other, making their application to dynamic and streaming data settings challenging. To address these issues, we exploit the analogy between PCA and graph convolutional filters to introduce the SpatioTemporal coVariance Neural Network (STVNN), a relational learning model that operates on the sample covariance matrix of the time series and leverages joint spatiotemporal convolutions to model the data. To account for the streaming and non-stationary setting, we consider an online update of the parameters and sample covariance matrix. We prove the STVNN is stable to the uncertainties introduced by these online estimations, thus improving over temporal PCA-based methods. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that STVNN is competitive for multivariate time series processing, it adapts to changes in the data distribution, and it is orders of magnitude more stable than online temporal PCA.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10069">Enhancing Anomaly Detection via Generating Diversified and Hard-to-distinguish Synthetic Anomalies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyuntae Kim, Changhee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a daunting task, as it relies solely on normality patterns from the training data to identify unseen anomalies during testing. Recent approaches have focused on leveraging domain-specific transformations or perturbations to generate synthetic anomalies from normal samples. The objective here is to acquire insights into normality patterns by learning to differentiate between normal samples and these crafted anomalies. However, these approaches often encounter limitations when domain-specific transformations are not well-specified such as in tabular data, or when it becomes trivial to distinguish between them. To address these issues, we introduce a novel domain-agnostic method that employs a set of conditional perturbators and a discriminator. The perturbators are trained to generate input-dependent perturbations, which are subsequently utilized to construct synthetic anomalies, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish normal samples from them. We ensure that the generated anomalies are both diverse and hard to distinguish through two key strategies: i) directing perturbations to be orthogonal to each other and ii) constraining perturbations to remain in proximity to normal samples. Throughout experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art benchmarks, which is evident not only in image data but also in tabular data, where domain-specific transformation is not readily accessible. Additionally, we empirically confirm the adaptability of our method to semi-supervised settings, demonstrating its capacity to incorporate supervised signals to enhance anomaly detection performance even further.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, leverages multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations within the latent space. Subsequently, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which implements a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the Steinmetz neural network's latent space. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Utilizing an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the upper bound on the generalization error posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by our proposed networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Jawanpuria, Dai Shi, Bamdev Mishra, Junbin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) theory has attracted much attention in machine learning and signal processing applications. OT defines a notion of distance between probability distributions of source and target data points. A crucial factor that influences OT-based distances is the ground metric of the embedding space in which the source and target data points lie. In this work, we propose to learn a suitable latent ground metric parameterized by a symmetric positive definite matrix. We use the rich Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices to jointly learn the OT distance along with the ground metric. Empirical results illustrate the efficacy of the learned metric in OT-based domain adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Coache, Sebastian Jaimungal</p>
<p>Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10111">Evaluating the Efficacy of Instance Incremental vs. Batch Learning in Delayed Label Environments: An Empirical Study on Tabular Data Streaming for Fraud Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kodjo Mawuena Amekoe, Mustapha Lebbah, Gregoire Jaffre, Hanene Azzag, Zaineb Chelly Dagdia</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world tabular learning production scenarios typically involve evolving data streams, where data arrives continuously and its distribution may change over time. In such a setting, most studies in the literature regarding supervised learning favor the use of instance incremental algorithms due to their ability to adapt to changes in the data distribution. Another significant reason for choosing these algorithms is \textit{avoid storing observations in memory} as commonly done in batch incremental settings. However, the design of instance incremental algorithms often assumes immediate availability of labels, which is an optimistic assumption. In many real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection or credit scoring, labels may be delayed. Consequently, batch incremental algorithms are widely used in many real-world tasks. This raises an important question: "In delayed settings, is instance incremental learning the best option regarding predictive performance and computational efficiency?" Unfortunately, this question has not been studied in depth, probably due to the scarcity of real datasets containing delayed information. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis of this question using a real-world fraud detection problem and commonly used generated datasets. Our findings indicate that instance incremental learning is not the superior option, considering on one side state-of-the-art models such as Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) and other side batch learning models such as XGBoost. Additionally, when considering the interpretability of the learning systems, batch incremental solutions tend to be favored. Code: \url{https://github.com/anselmeamekoe/DelayedLabelStream}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Jakobs, Thomas Liebig</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works for time-series forecasting more and more leverage the high predictive power of Deep Learning models. With this increase in model complexity, however, comes a lack in understanding of the underlying model decision process, which is problematic for high-stakes decision making. At the same time, simple, interpretable forecasting methods such as Linear Models can still perform very well, sometimes on-par, with Deep Learning approaches. We argue that simple models are good enough most of the time, and forecasting performance can be improved by choosing a Deep Learning method only for certain predictions, increasing the overall interpretability of the forecasting process. In this context, we propose a novel online model selection framework which uses meta-learning to identify these predictions and only rarely uses a non-interpretable, large model. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets shows that our selection methodology outperforms state-of-the-art online model selections methods in most cases. We find that almost always choosing a simple Linear Model for forecasting results in competitive performance, suggesting that the need for opaque black-box models in time-series forecasting is smaller than recent works would suggest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolai Dorka</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Liu, Jiacheng Gu, Xiyuan Huang, Junjie Shi, Tongtong Feng, Ning He</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate sports prediction is a crucial skill for professional coaches, which can assist in developing effective training strategies and scientific competition tactics. Traditional methods often use complex mathematical statistical techniques to boost predictability, but this often is limited by dataset scale and has difficulty handling long-term predictions with variable distributions, notably underperforming when predicting point-set-game multi-level matches. To deal with this challenge, this paper proposes TM2, a TCDformer-based Momentum Transfer Model for long-term sports prediction, which encompasses a momentum encoding module and a prediction module based on momentum transfer. TM2 initially encodes momentum in large-scale unstructured time series using the local linear scaling approximation (LLSA) module. Then it decomposes the reconstructed time series with momentum transfer into trend and seasonal components. The final prediction results are derived from the additive combination of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for predicting trend components and wavelet attention mechanisms for seasonal components. Comprehensive experimental results show that on the 2023 Wimbledon men's tournament datasets, TM2 significantly surpasses existing sports prediction models in terms of performance, reducing MSE by 61.64% and MAE by 63.64%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Handling haphazard streaming data, such as data from edge devices, presents a challenging problem. Over time, the incoming data becomes inconsistent, with missing, faulty, or new inputs reappearing. Therefore, it requires models that are reliable. Recent methods to solve this problem depend on a hedging-based solution and require specialized elements like auxiliary dropouts, forked architectures, and intricate network design. We observed that hedging can be reduced to a special case of weighted residual connection; this motivated us to approximate it with plain self-attention. In this work, we propose HapNet, a simple baseline that is scalable, does not require online backpropagation, and is adaptable to varying input types. All present methods are restricted to scaling with a fixed window; however, we introduce a more complex problem of scaling with a variable window where the data becomes positionally uncorrelated, and cannot be addressed by present methods. We demonstrate that a variant of the proposed approach can work even for this complex scenario. We extensively evaluated the proposed approach on five benchmarks and found competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrad Soltani, Luis Rueda</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs tackle the limitations of traditional graphs by introducing {\em hyperedges}. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges. Also, the underlying message-passing mechanisms in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are in the form of vertex-hyperedge-vertex, which let HGNNs capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). More recently, the idea of overlapping subgraphs has emerged. These subgraphs can capture more information about subgroups of vertices without limiting one vertex belonging to just one group, allowing vertices to belong to multiple groups or subgraphs. In addition, one of the most important problems in graph clustering is to find densest overlapping subgraphs (DOS). In this paper, we propose a solution to the DOS problem via Agglomerative Greedy Enumeration (DOSAGE) algorithm as a novel approach to enhance the process of generating the densest overlapping subgraphs and, hence, a robust construction of the hypergraphs. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the DOSAGE algorithm significantly outperforms the HGNNs and six other methods on the node classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi-Zhi Niu, Jun Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural, physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them. Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results demonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical derivatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S\"uleyman Y{\i}ld{\i}z, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an energy-preserving machine learning method for inferring reduced-order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi-symplectic form of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of energy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to construct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers, these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete operators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of the multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation and preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the linear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models by testing them far outside the training time interval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning, known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative, utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network edges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns about their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and experimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from medicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred. For example, in a three-class classification problem within additive manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of activation function selection in neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Ming Wang, Nan Xue, Ling Lei, Rebecka J\"ornsten, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distribution matching (DM), which is a fundamental machine learning problem seeking to robustly align two probability distributions. Our approach is established on a relaxed formulation, called partial distribution matching (PDM), which seeks to match a fraction of the distributions instead of matching them completely. We theoretically derive the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality for the partial Wasserstain-1 (PW) discrepancy, and develop a partial Wasserstein adversarial network (PWAN) that efficiently approximates the PW discrepancy based on this dual form. Partial matching can then be achieved by optimizing the network using gradient descent. Two practical tasks, point set registration and partial domain adaptation are investigated, where the goals are to partially match distributions in 3D space and high-dimensional feature space respectively. The experiment results confirm that the proposed PWAN effectively produces highly robust matching results, performing better or on par with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516">RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity. RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention, and addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of long-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panfeng Li, Youzuo Lin, Emily Schultz-Fellenz</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation for aerial imagery is a challenging and important problem in remotely sensed imagery analysis. In recent years, with the success of deep learning, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have been developed. However, due to the varying sizes of the objects and imbalanced class labels, it can be challenging to obtain accurate pixel-wise semantic segmentation results. To address those challenges, we develop a novel semantic segmentation method and call it Contextual Hourglass Network. In our method, in order to improve the robustness of the prediction, we design a new contextual hourglass module which incorporates attention mechanism on processed low-resolution featuremaps to exploit the contextual semantics. We further exploit the stacked encoder-decoder structure by connecting multiple contextual hourglass modules from end to end. This architecture can effectively extract rich multi-scale features and add more feedback loops for better learning contextual semantics through intermediate supervision. To demonstrate the efficacy of our semantic segmentation method, we test it on Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets. Through the comparisons to other baseline methods, our method yields the best results on overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time object tracking necessitates a delicate balance between speed and accuracy, a challenge exacerbated by the computational demands of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Triggered Detection (CTD), an innovative approach that strategically bypasses object detection for frames closely resembling intermediate states, leveraging tracker confidence scores. CTD not only enhances tracking speed but also preserves accuracy, surpassing existing tracking algorithms. Through extensive evaluation across various tracker confidence thresholds, we identify an optimal trade-off between tracking speed and accuracy, providing crucial insights for parameter fine-tuning and enhancing CTD's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our experiments across diverse detection models underscore the robustness and versatility of the CTD framework, demonstrating its potential to enable real-time tracking in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amon Lahr, Andrea Zanelli, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger</p>
<p>Abstract: By enabling constraint-aware online model adaptation, model predictive control using Gaussian process (GP) regression has exhibited impressive performance in real-world applications and received considerable attention in the learning-based control community. Yet, solving the resulting optimal control problem in real-time generally remains a major challenge, due to i) the increased number of augmented states in the optimization problem, as well as ii) computationally expensive evaluations of the posterior mean and covariance and their respective derivatives. To tackle these challenges, we employ i) a tailored Jacobian approximation in a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach, and combine it with ii) a parallelizable GP inference and automatic differentiation framework. Reducing the numerical complexity with respect to the state dimension $n_x$ for each SQP iteration from $\mathcal{O}(n_x^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3)$, and accelerating GP evaluations on a graphical processing unit, the proposed algorithm computes suboptimal, yet feasible solutions at drastically reduced computation times and exhibits favorable local convergence properties. Numerical experiments verify the scaling properties and investigate the runtime distribution across different parts of the algorithm.</p>

Secondly, autoencoder-based techniques focus on learning optimal embeddings for questions and images, achieving comparable results with GAN due to better ability on complex questions.

<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel contribution to the field of regional style transfer. Existing methods often suffer from the drawback of applying style homogeneously across the entire image, leading to stylistic inconsistencies or foreground object twisted when applied to image with foreground elements such as person figures. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach that leverages a segmentation network to precisely isolate foreground objects within the input image. Subsequently, style transfer is applied exclusively to the background region. The isolated foreground objects are then carefully reintegrated into the style-transferred background. To enhance the visual coherence between foreground and background, a color transfer step is employed on the foreground elements prior to their rein-corporation. Finally, we utilize feathering techniques to achieve a seamless amalgamation of foreground and background, resulting in a visually unified and aesthetically pleasing final composition. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach yields significantly more natural stylistic transformations compared to conventional methods.</p>

Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying Deep Learning (DL) on embedded end devices is a scorching trend in pervasive computing. Since most Microcontrollers on embedded devices have limited computing power, it is necessary to add a DL accelerator. Embedded Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are suitable for deploying DL accelerators for embedded devices, but developing an energy-efficient DL accelerator on an FPGA is not easy. Therefore, we propose the ElasticAI-Workflow that aims to help DL developers to create and deploy DL models as hardware accelerators on embedded FPGAs. This workflow consists of two key components: the ElasticAI-Creator and the Elastic Node. The former is a toolchain for automatically generating DL accelerators on FPGAs. The latter is a hardware platform for verifying the performance of the generated accelerators. With this combination, the performance of the accelerator can be sufficiently guaranteed. We will demonstrate the potential of our approach through a case study.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation and question-answering, their effectiveness in AI legal and policy is limited by outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and inadequate reasoning in complex contexts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems improve response accuracy by integrating external knowledge but struggle with retrieval errors, poor context integration, and high costs, particularly in interpreting qualitative and quantitative AI legal texts. This paper introduces a Hybrid Parameter-Adaptive RAG (HyPA-RAG) system tailored for AI legal and policy, exemplified by NYC Local Law 144 (LL144). HyPA-RAG uses a query complexity classifier for adaptive parameter tuning, a hybrid retrieval strategy combining dense, sparse, and knowledge graph methods, and an evaluation framework with specific question types and metrics. By dynamically adjusting parameters, HyPA-RAG significantly improves retrieval accuracy and response fidelity. Testing on LL144 shows enhanced correctness, faithfulness, and contextual precision, addressing the need for adaptable NLP systems in complex, high-stakes AI legal and policy applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Lehmann, Philipp B. Cornelius, Fabian J. Sting</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study how generative AI and specifically large language models (LLMs) impact learning in coding classes. We show across three studies that LLM usage can have positive and negative effects on learning outcomes. Using observational data from university-level programming courses, we establish such effects in the field. We replicate these findings in subsequent experimental studies, which closely resemble typical learning scenarios, to show causality. We find evidence for two contrasting mechanisms that determine the overall effect of LLM usage on learning. Students who use LLMs as personal tutors by conversing about the topic and asking for explanations benefit from usage. However, learning is impaired for students who excessively rely on LLMs to solve practice exercises for them and thus do not invest sufficient own mental effort. Those who never used LLMs before are particularly prone to such adverse behavior. Students without prior domain knowledge gain more from having access to LLMs. Finally, we show that the self-perceived benefits of using LLMs for learning exceed the actual benefits, potentially resulting in an overestimation of one's own abilities. Overall, our findings show promising potential of LLMs as learning support, however also that students have to be very cautious of possible pitfalls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumari Nishu, Minsik Cho, Devang Naik</p>
<p>Abstract: User-defined keyword spotting on a resource-constrained edge device is challenging. However, keywords are often bounded by a maximum keyword length, which has been largely under-leveraged in prior works. Our analysis of keyword-length distribution shows that user-defined keyword spotting can be treated as a length-constrained problem, eliminating the need for aggregation over variable text length. This leads to our proposed method for efficient keyword spotting, SLiCK (exploiting Subsequences for Length-Constrained Keyword spotting). We further introduce a subsequence-level matching scheme to learn audio-text relations at a finer granularity, thus distinguishing similar-sounding keywords more effectively through enhanced context. In SLiCK, the model is trained with a multi-task learning approach using two modules: Matcher (utterance-level matching task, novel subsequence-level matching task) and Encoder (phoneme recognition task). The proposed method improves the baseline results on Libriphrase hard dataset, increasing AUC from $88.52$ to $94.9$ and reducing EER from $18.82$ to $11.1$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangwei Gao, Peng Yang, Yuxin Kong, Feng Lyu, Ning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) services can efficiently satisfy user-specified content creation demands, but the high computational requirements pose various challenges to supporting mobile users at scale. In this paper, we present our design of an edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning system to properly assign computing tasks of generative models to edge servers, thereby improving overall user experience and reducing content generation latency. Specifically, once the edge server receives user requested task prompts, it dynamically assigns appropriate models and allocates computing resources based on features of each category of prompts. The generated contents are then delivered to users. The key to this system is a proposed probabilistic model assignment approach, which estimates the quality score of generated contents for each prompt based on category labels. Next, we introduce a heuristic algorithm that enables adaptive configuration of both generation steps and resource allocation, according to the various task requests received by each generative model on the edge.Simulation results demonstrate that the designed system can effectively enhance the quality of generated content by up to 4.7% while reducing response delay by up to 39.1% compared to benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maurizio Vassallo, Amina Benzerga, Alireza Bahmanyar, Damien Ernst</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of distributed energy resources, particularly photovoltaic (PV) panels, has presented new and complex challenges for power network control. With the significant energy production from PV panels, voltage issues in the network have become a problem. Currently, PV smart inverters (SIs) are used to mitigate the voltage problems by controlling their active power generation and reactive power injection or absorption. However, reducing the active power output of PV panels can be perceived as unfair to some customers, discouraging future installations. To solve this issue, in this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is proposed to address voltage issues in a distribution network, while considering fairness in active power curtailment among customers. The feasibility of the proposed approach is explored through experiments, demonstrating its ability to effectively control voltage in a fair and efficient manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Menden, Yahya Saleh, Armin Iske</p>
<p>Abstract: We establish empirical risk minimization principles for active learning by deriving a family of upper bounds on the generalization error. Aligning with empirical observations, the bounds suggest that superior query algorithms can be obtained by combining both informativeness and representativeness query strategies, where the latter is assessed using integral probability metrics. To facilitate the use of these bounds in application, we systematically link diverse active learning scenarios, characterized by their loss functions and hypothesis classes to their corresponding upper bounds. Our results show that regularization techniques used to constraint the complexity of various hypothesis classes are sufficient conditions to ensure the validity of the bounds. The present work enables principled construction and empirical quality-evaluation of query algorithms in active learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) models on streaming graphs entail algorithmic challenges to continuously capture its dynamic state, as well as systems challenges to optimize latency, memory, and throughput during both inference and training. We present D3-GNN, the first distributed, hybrid-parallel, streaming GNN system designed to handle real-time graph updates under online query setting. Our system addresses data management, algorithmic, and systems challenges, enabling continuous capturing of the dynamic state of the graph and updating node representations with fault-tolerance and optimal latency, load-balance, and throughput. D3-GNN utilizes streaming GNN aggregators and an unrolled, distributed computation graph architecture to handle cascading graph updates. To counteract data skew and neighborhood explosion issues, we introduce inter-layer and intra-layer windowed forward pass solutions. Experiments on large-scale graph streams demonstrate that D3-GNN achieves high efficiency and scalability. Compared to DGL, D3-GNN achieves a significant throughput improvement of about 76x for streaming workloads. The windowed enhancement further reduces running times by around 10x and message volumes by up to 15x at higher parallelism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Rama, Madison Threadgill, Andreas Gerstlauer</p>
<p>Abstract: The training of deep and/or convolutional neural networks (DNNs/CNNs) is traditionally done on servers with powerful CPUs and GPUs. Recent efforts have emerged to localize machine learning tasks fully on the edge. This brings advantages in reduced latency and increased privacy, but necessitates working with resource-constrained devices. Approaches for inference and training in mobile and edge devices based on pruning, quantization or incremental and transfer learning require trading off accuracy. Several works have explored distributing inference operations on mobile and edge clusters instead. However, there is limited literature on distributed training on the edge. Existing approaches all require a central, potentially powerful edge or cloud server for coordination or offloading. In this paper, we describe an approach for distributed CNN training exclusively on mobile and edge devices. Our approach is beneficial for the initial CNN layers that are feature map dominated. It is based on partitioning forward inference and back-propagation operations among devices through tiling and fusing to maximize locality and expose communication and memory-aware parallelism. We also introduce the concept of layer grouping to further fine-tune performance based on computation and communication trade-off. Results show that for a cluster of 2-6 quad-core Raspberry Pi3 devices, training of an object-detection CNN provides a 2x-15x speedup with respect to a single core and up to 8x reduction in memory usage per device, all without sacrificing accuracy. Grouping offers up to 1.5x speedup depending on the reference profile and batch size.</p>

The network is trained by penalizing violations of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, ensuring that its predictions adhere to these optimality criteria. Additionally, since the bounds of the parameter space are known, training batches can be randomly generated without requiring external data.

<p>Abstract: Understanding of how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters, complicating interpretability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialuo Chen, Jingyi Wang, Xiyue Zhang, Youcheng Sun, Marta Kwiatkowska, Jiming Chen, Peng Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the vast testing space, the increasing demand for effective and efficient testing of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to the development of various DNN test case prioritization techniques. However, the fact that DNNs can deliver high-confidence predictions for incorrectly predicted examples, known as the over-confidence problem, causes these methods to fail to reveal high-confidence errors. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose FAST, a method that boosts existing prioritization methods through guided FeAture SelecTion. FAST is based on the insight that certain features may introduce noise that affects the model's output confidence, thereby contributing to high-confidence errors. It quantifies the importance of each feature for the model's correct predictions, and then dynamically prunes the information from the noisy features during inference to derive a new probability vector for the uncertainty estimation. With the help of FAST, the high-confidence errors and correctly classified examples become more distinguishable, resulting in higher APFD (Average Percentage of Fault Detection) values for test prioritization, and higher generalization ability for model enhancement. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate FAST across a diverse set of model structures on multiple benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of FAST compared to the state-of-the-art prioritization techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, wearable computing devices (``smart glasses'') have undergone remarkable advancements in sensor technology, design, and processing power, ushering in a new era of opportunity for high-density human behavior data. Equipped with wearable cameras, these glasses offer a unique opportunity to analyze non-verbal behavior in natural settings as individuals interact. Our focus lies in predicting engagement in dyadic interactions by scrutinizing verbal and non-verbal cues, aiming to detect signs of disinterest or confusion. Leveraging such analyses may revolutionize our understanding of human communication, foster more effective collaboration in professional environments, provide better mental health support through empathetic virtual interactions, and enhance accessibility for those with communication barriers.
  In this work, we collect a dataset featuring 34 participants engaged in casual dyadic conversations, each providing self-reported engagement ratings at the end of each conversation. We introduce a novel fusion strategy using Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multiple behavior modalities into a ``multimodal transcript'' that can be processed by an LLM for behavioral reasoning tasks. Remarkably, this method achieves performance comparable to established fusion techniques even in its preliminary implementation, indicating strong potential for further research and optimization. This fusion method is one of the first to approach ``reasoning'' about real-world human behavior through a language model. Smart glasses provide us the ability to unobtrusively gather high-density multimodal data on human behavior, paving the way for new approaches to understanding and improving human communication with the potential for important societal benefits. The features and data collected during the studies will be made publicly available to promote further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim Radouane, Sylvie Ranwez, Julien Lagarde, Andon Tchechmedjiev</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address a challenging task, synchronous motion captioning, that aim to generate a language description synchronized with human motion sequences. This task pertains to numerous applications, such as aligned sign language transcription, unsupervised action segmentation and temporal grounding. Our method introduces mechanisms to control self- and cross-attention distributions of the Transformer, allowing interpretability and time-aligned text generation. We achieve this through masking strategies and structuring losses that push the model to maximize attention only on the most important frames contributing to the generation of a motion word. These constraints aim to prevent undesired mixing of information in attention maps and to provide a monotonic attention distribution across tokens. Thus, the cross attentions of tokens are used for progressive text generation in synchronization with human motion sequences. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through evaluation on the two available benchmark datasets, KIT-ML and HumanML3D. As visual evaluation is essential for this task, we provide a comprehensive set of animated visual illustrations in the code repository: https://github.com/rd20karim/Synch-Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bach Do, Sina Jafari Ghalekohneh, Taiwo Adebiyi, Bo Zhao, Ruda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermal emitters that break Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation promise exciting applications for thermal and energy applications. The design of the bandwidth and angular range of the nonreciprocal effect, which directly affects the performance of nonreciprocal emitters, typically relies on physical intuition. In this study, we present a general numerical approach to maximize the nonreciprocal effect. We choose doped magneto-optic materials and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials as model materials and focus on pattern-free multilayer structures. The optimization randomly starts from a less effective structure and incrementally improves the broadband nonreciprocity through the combination of Bayesian optimization and reparameterization. Optimization results show that the proposed approach can discover structures that can achieve broadband nonreciprocal emission at wavelengths from 5 to 40 micrometers using only a fewer layers, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art designs based on intuition in terms of both performance and simplicity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Xiao, Boqian Wu, Lu Yin, Christopher Neil Gadzinski, Tianjin Huang, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Decebal Constantin Mocanu</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has demonstrated impressive progress, it remains a daunting challenge to learn from hard samples as these samples are usually noisy and intricate. These hard samples play a crucial role in the optimal performance of deep neural networks. Most research on Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) has focused on standard training data, leaving gaps in understanding their effectiveness on complex and challenging data. This paper's extensive investigation across scenarios reveals that most SNNs trained on challenging samples can often match or surpass dense models in accuracy at certain sparsity levels, especially with limited data. We observe that layer-wise density ratios tend to play an important role in SNN performance, particularly for methods that train from scratch without pre-trained initialization. These insights enhance our understanding of SNNs' behavior and potential for efficient learning approaches in data-centric AI.

<p>Abstract: Process mining on business process execution data has focused primarily on orchestration-type processes performed in a single organization (intra-organizational). Collaborative (inter-organizational) processes, unlike those of orchestration type, expand several organizations (for example, in e-Government), adding complexity and various challenges both for their implementation and for their discovery, prediction, and analysis of their execution. Predictive process monitoring is based on exploiting execution data from past instances to predict the execution of current cases. It is possible to make predictions on the next activity and remaining time, among others, to anticipate possible deviations, violations, and delays in the processes to take preventive measures (e.g., re-allocation of resources). In this work, we propose an extension for collaborative processes of traditional process prediction, considering particularities of this type of process, which add information of interest in this context, for example, the next activity of which participant or the following message to be exchanged between two participants.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conventional WENO3 methods are known to be highly dissipative at lower resolutions, introducing significant errors in the pre-asymptotic regime. In this paper, we employ a rational neural network to accurately estimate the local smoothness of the solution, dynamically adapting the stencil weights based on local solution features. As rational neural networks can represent fast transitions between smooth and sharp regimes, this approach achieves a granular reconstruction with significantly reduced dissipation, improving the accuracy of the simulation. The network is trained offline on a carefully chosen dataset of analytical functions, bypassing the need for differentiable solvers. We also propose a robust model selection criterion based on estimates of the interpolation's convergence order on a set of test functions, which correlates better with the model performance in downstream tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several one-, two-, and three-dimensional fluid flow problems: our scheme generalizes across grid resolutions while handling smooth and discontinuous solutions. In most cases, our rational network-based scheme achieves higher accuracy than conventional WENO3 with the same stencil size, and in a few of them, it achieves accuracy comparable to WENO5, which uses a larger stencil.</p>

<p>Abstract: Owing to the unprecedented capability in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, the pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown fantastic potential in developing the next-generation recommender systems (RSs). However, the static index paradigm adopted by current methods greatly restricts the utilization of LLMs capacity for recommendation, leading to not only the insufficient alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge, but also the neglect of high-order user-item interaction patterns. In this paper, we propose Twin-Tower Dynamic Semantic Recommender (TTDS), the first generative RS which adopts dynamic semantic index paradigm, targeting at resolving the above problems simultaneously. To be more specific, we for the first time contrive a dynamic knowledge fusion framework which integrates a twin-tower semantic token generator into the LLM-based recommender, hierarchically allocating meaningful semantic index for items and users, and accordingly predicting the semantic index of target item. Furthermore, a dual-modality variational auto-encoder is proposed to facilitate multi-grained alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge. Eventually, a series of novel tuning tasks specially customized for capturing high-order user-item interaction patterns are proposed to take advantages of user historical behavior. Extensive experiments across three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology in developing LLM-based generative RSs. The proposed TTDS recommender achieves an average improvement of 19.41% in Hit-Rate and 20.84% in NDCG metric, compared with the leading baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Yang, Yining Hong, Grace A. Lewis, Tongshuang Wu, Christian K\"astner</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models make mistakes, yet sometimes it is difficult to identify the systematic problems behind the mistakes. Practitioners engage in various activities, including error analysis, testing, auditing, and red-teaming, to form hypotheses of what can go (or has gone) wrong with their models. To validate these hypotheses, practitioners employ data slicing to identify relevant examples. However, traditional data slicing is limited by available features and programmatic slicing functions. In this work, we propose SemSlicer, a framework that supports semantic data slicing, which identifies a semantically coherent slice, without the need for existing features. SemSlicer uses Large Language Models to annotate datasets and generate slices from any user-defined slicing criteria. We show that SemSlicer generates accurate slices with low cost, allows flexible trade-offs between different design dimensions, reliably identifies under-performing data slices, and helps practitioners identify useful data slices that reflect systematic problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become a key use-case in several applications to aid user experience, particularly after Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieving good results in zero-shot inference. But evaluating different VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating VLMs tailored to VQA tasks in practical settings. We present a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, three key practical aspects on which tasks can vary. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that no single model excelling universally, making appropriate selection a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, though open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B demonstrate competitive strengths in specific contexts, while providing additional advantages. This study guides the selection of VLMs based on specific task requirements and resource constraints, and can also be extended to other vision-language tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have been combined with Federated Learning (FL) to improve training of downstream tasks while preserving privacy. However, deploying FMs over edge networks with resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices is under-explored. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely, Federated Distilling knowledge to Prompt (FedD2P), for leveraging the robust representation abilities of a vision-language FM without deploying it locally on edge devices. This framework distills the aggregated knowledge of IoT devices to a prompt generator to efficiently adapt the frozen FM for downstream tasks. To eliminate the dependency on a public dataset, our framework leverages perclass local knowledge from IoT devices and linguistic descriptions of classes to train the prompt generator. Our experiments on diverse image classification datasets CIFAR, OxfordPets, SVHN, EuroSAT, and DTD show that FedD2P outperforms the baselines in terms of model performance.</p>

This paper introduces ``LabellessFace'', a novel framework that improves demographic bias in face recognition without requiring demographic group labeling typically required for fairness considerations. We propose a novel fairness enhancement metric called the class favoritism level, which assesses the extent of favoritism towards specific classes across the dataset. Leveraging this metric, we introduce the fair class margin penalty, an extension of existing margin-based metric learning. This method dynamically adjusts learning parameters based on class favoritism levels, promoting fairness across all attributes. By treating each class as an individual in facial recognition systems, we facilitate learning that minimizes biases in authentication accuracy among individuals. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method is effective for enhancing fairness while maintaining authentication accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Lv, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaito Baba, Wataru Nakata, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari</p>
<p>Abstract: We present our system (denoted as T05) for the VoiceMOS Challenge (VMC) 2024. Our system was designed for the VMC 2024 Track 1, which focused on the accurate prediction of naturalness mean opinion score (MOS) for high-quality synthetic speech. In addition to a pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech feature extractor, our system incorporates a pretrained image feature extractor to capture the difference of synthetic speech observed in speech spectrograms. We first separately train two MOS predictors that use either of an SSL-based or spectrogram-based feature. Then, we fine-tune the two predictors for better MOS prediction using the fusion of two extracted features. In the VMC 2024 Track 1, our T05 system achieved first place in 7 out of 16 evaluation metrics and second place in the remaining 9 metrics, with a significant difference compared to those ranked third and below. We also report the results of our ablation study to investigate essential factors of our system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Alonso, Julius B. Kirkegaard, Robert G. Endres</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell organisms and various cell types use a range of motility modes when following a chemical gradient, but it is unclear which mode is best suited for different gradients. Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form \textit{de novo} pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, an approach to training and evaluating an adapter model for the popular language model "zephyr-7b-beta" is described. The adapter was developed to improve the performance of the base model in tasks related to programming and understanding the Russian language. Considering the high quality of the original model in tasks in the English language, the goal of the research was to expand its linguistic and technical spectrum. The proposed adapter was trained using a large and diverse dataset, including question-answer pairs related to programming, as well code-related texts in Russian language. The applied training methodology ensures an improvement in the model's quality of answers in understanding and generating Python code based on Russian instructions. We evaluated the performance of the base model with the installed adapter using various metrics, comparing it to the base model as well as other state-of-the-art models in this field. The obtained results showed significant improvement, both in tasks related to writing Python code and in processing the Russian language, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed adapter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixin Jin, Jonathan Weyn, Pengcheng Zhao, Siqi Xiang, Jiang Bian, Zuliang Fang, Haiyu Dong, Hongyu Sun, Kit Thambiratnam, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, AI-based weather forecasting models have matched or even outperformed numerical weather prediction systems. However, most of these models have been trained and evaluated on reanalysis datasets like ERA5. These datasets, being products of numerical models, often diverge substantially from actual observations in some crucial variables like near-surface temperature, wind, precipitation and clouds - parameters that hold significant public interest. To address this divergence, we introduce WeatherReal, a novel benchmark dataset for weather forecasting, derived from global near-surface in-situ observations. WeatherReal also features a publicly accessible quality control and evaluation framework. This paper details the sources and processing methodologies underlying the dataset, and further illustrates the advantage of in-situ observations in capturing hyper-local and extreme weather through comparative analyses and case studies. Using WeatherReal, we evaluated several data-driven models and compared them with leading numerical models. Our work aims to advance the AI-based weather forecasting research towards a more application-focused and operation-ready approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingxing Wei, Caixin Kang, Yinpeng Dong, Zhengyi Wang, Shouwei Ruan, Yubo Chen, Hang Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial patches present significant challenges to the robustness of deep learning models, making the development of effective defenses become critical for real-world applications. This paper introduces DIFFender, a novel DIFfusion-based DeFender framework that leverages the power of a text-guided diffusion model to counter adversarial patch attacks. At the core of our approach is the discovery of the Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP) phenomenon, which enables the diffusion model to accurately detect and locate adversarial patches by analyzing distributional anomalies. DIFFender seamlessly integrates the tasks of patch localization and restoration within a unified diffusion model framework, enhancing defense efficacy through their close interaction. Additionally, DIFFender employs an efficient few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm, facilitating the adaptation of the pre-trained diffusion model to defense tasks without the need for extensive retraining. Our comprehensive evaluation, covering image classification and face recognition tasks, as well as real-world scenarios, demonstrates DIFFender's robust performance against adversarial attacks. The framework's versatility and generalizability across various settings, classifiers, and attack methodologies mark a significant advancement in adversarial patch defense strategies. Except for the popular visible domain, we have identified another advantage of DIFFender: its capability to easily expand into the infrared domain. Consequently, we demonstrate the good flexibility of DIFFender, which can defend against both infrared and visible adversarial patch attacks alternatively using a universal defense framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Lingo, Martin Arroyo, Rajeev Chhajer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet improving their problem-solving capabilities, particularly for complex, reasoning-intensive tasks, remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces the REAP (Reflection, Explicit Problem Deconstruction, and Advanced Prompting) method, an innovative approach within the dynamic context generation framework. REAP guides LLMs through reflection on the query, deconstructing it into manageable components, and generating relevant context to enhance the solution process. We evaluated REAP using a dataset designed to expose LLM limitations, comparing zero-shot prompting with REAP-enhanced prompts across six state-of-the-art models: OpenAI's o1-preview, o1-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The results demonstrate notable performance gains, with o1-mini improving by 40.97%, GPT-4o by 66.26%, and GPT-4o-mini by 112.93%. Despite the already strong baseline performance of OpenAI's o1-preview, modest gains were observed. Beyond performance improvements, REAP offers a cost-effective solution; for example, GPT-4o-mini, which is approximately 100 times cheaper than o1-preview, delivered competitive results. REAP also improves the clarity of model outputs, making it easier for humans to understand the reasoning behind the results and simplifying the process of identifying and addressing any issues. These findings demonstrate REAP's potential to greatly improve the capabilities of LLMs, providing both better performance and increased cost-efficiency across a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Shirwatkar, Naman Saxena, Kishore Chandra, Shishir Kolathaya</p>
<p>Abstract: A core strength of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for quadrupedal locomotion has been its ability to enforce constraints and provide interpretability of the sequence of commands over the horizon. However, despite being able to plan, MPC struggles to scale with task complexity, often failing to achieve robust behavior on rapidly changing surfaces. On the other hand, model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have outperformed MPC on multiple terrains, showing emergent motions but inherently lack any ability to handle constraints or perform planning. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that integrates proprioceptive planning with RL, allowing for agile and safe locomotion behaviors through the horizon. Inspired by MPC, we incorporate an internal model that includes a velocity estimator and a Dreamer module. During training, the framework learns an expert policy and an internal model that are co-dependent, facilitating exploration for improved locomotion behaviors. During deployment, the Dreamer module solves an infinite-horizon MPC problem, adapting actions and velocity commands to respect the constraints. We validate the robustness of our training framework through ablation studies on internal model components and demonstrate improved robustness to training noise. Finally, we evaluate our approach across multi-terrain scenarios in both simulation and hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Chia Chang, Adam J. Stewart, Favyen Bastani, Piper Wolters, Shreya Kannan, George R. Huber, Jingtong Wang, Arindam Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. Recently, the Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed countries not transferring well to data-scarce developing countries -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select six crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, the benefits of pre-training on OOD data are the most significant when only 10--100 ID training samples are used. Transfer learning and pre-training with OOD and limited ID data show promising applications, as many developing regions have scarce crop type labels. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao He, Baxi Chong, Zhaochen Xu, Sehoon Ha, Daniel I. Goldman</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating rugged landscapes poses significant challenges for legged locomotion. Multi-legged robots (those with 6 and greater) offer a promising solution for such terrains, largely due to their inherent high static stability, resulting from a low center of mass and wide base of support. Such systems require minimal effort to maintain balance. Recent studies have shown that a linear controller, which modulates the vertical body undulation of a multi-legged robot in response to shifts in terrain roughness, can ensure reliable mobility on challenging terrains. However, the potential of a learning-based control framework that adjusts multiple parameters to address terrain heterogeneity remains underexplored. We posit that the development of an experimentally validated physics-based simulator for this robot can rapidly advance capabilities by allowing wide parameter space exploration. Here we develop a MuJoCo-based simulator tailored to this robotic platform and use the simulation to develop a reinforcement learning-based control framework that dynamically adjusts horizontal and vertical body undulation, and limb stepping in real-time. Our approach improves robot performance in simulation, laboratory experiments, and outdoor tests. Notably, our real-world experiments reveal that the learning-based controller achieves a 30\% to 50\% increase in speed compared to a linear controller, which only modulates vertical body waves. We hypothesize that the superior performance of the learning-based controller arises from its ability to adjust multiple parameters simultaneously, including limb stepping, horizontal body wave, and vertical body wave.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis and treatment of polyps during colonoscopy are essential for reducing the incidence and mortality of Colorectal Cancer (CRC). However, the variability in polyp characteristics and the presence of artifacts in colonoscopy images and videos pose significant challenges for accurate and efficient polyp detection and segmentation. This paper presents a novel approach to polyp segmentation by integrating the Segment Anything Model (SAM 2) with the YOLOv8 model. Our method leverages YOLOv8's bounding box predictions to autonomously generate input prompts for SAM 2, thereby reducing the need for manual annotations. We conducted exhaustive tests on five benchmark colonoscopy image datasets and two colonoscopy video datasets, demonstrating that our method exceeds state-of-the-art models in both image and video segmentation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves high segmentation accuracy using only bounding box annotations, significantly reducing annotation time and effort.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shraddha Rajpal, Zeeshan Ahmed, Tyrus Berry</p>
<p>Abstract: We evaluate the impact of inference model on uncertainties when using continuous wave Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) measurements to infer temperature. Our approach leverages a probabilistic feedforward inference model designed to maximize the likelihood of observed ODMR spectra through automatic differentiation. This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Shi, Muning Wen, Qi Zhang, Weinan Zhang, Cunjia Liu, Weiru Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has revolutionized decision-making processes in dynamic environments, yet it often struggles with autonomously detecting and achieving goals without clear feedback signals. For example, in a Source Term Estimation problem, the lack of precise environmental information makes it challenging to provide clear feedback signals and to define and evaluate how the source's location is determined. To address this challenge, the Autonomous Goal Detection and Cessation (AGDC) module was developed, enhancing various RL algorithms by incorporating a self-feedback mechanism for autonomous goal detection and cessation upon task completion. Our method effectively identifies and ceases undefined goals by approximating the agent's belief, significantly enhancing the capabilities of RL algorithms in environments with limited feedback. To validate effectiveness of our approach, we integrated AGDC with deep Q-Network, proximal policy optimization, and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms, and evaluated its performance on the Source Term Estimation problem. The experimental results showed that AGDC-enhanced RL algorithms significantly outperformed traditional statistical methods such as infotaxis, entrotaxis, and dual control for exploitation and exploration, as well as a non-statistical random action selection method. These improvements were evident in terms of success rate, mean traveled distance, and search time, highlighting AGDC's effectiveness and efficiency in complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful image transformations (i.e. rotation, thickness, blur) directly from examples can be a challenging task. Recently, the Manifold Autoencoder (MAE) proposed using a set of Lie group operators to learn image transformations directly from examples. However, this approach has limitations, as the learned operators are not guaranteed to be disentangled and the training routine is prohibitively expensive when scaling up the model. To address these limitations, we propose MANGO (transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators) for learning disentangled operators that describe image transformations in distinct latent subspaces. Moreover, our approach allows practitioners the ability to define which transformations they aim to model, thus improving the semantic meaning of the learned operators. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that MANGO enables composition of image transformations and introduces a one-phase training routine that leads to a 100x speedup over prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy is widely considered the formal privacy for privacy-preserving data analysis due to its robust and rigorous guarantees, with increasingly broad adoption in public services, academia, and industry. Despite originating in the cryptographic context, in this review paper we argue that, fundamentally, differential privacy can be considered a \textit{pure} statistical concept. By leveraging a theorem due to David Blackwell, our focus is to demonstrate that the definition of differential privacy can be formally motivated from a hypothesis testing perspective, thereby showing that hypothesis testing is not merely convenient but also the right language for reasoning about differential privacy. This insight leads to the definition of $f$-differential privacy, which extends other differential privacy definitions through a representation theorem. We review techniques that render $f$-differential privacy a unified framework for analyzing privacy bounds in data analysis and machine learning. Applications of this differential privacy definition to private deep learning, private convex optimization, shuffled mechanisms, and U.S.~Census data are discussed to highlight the benefits of analyzing privacy bounds under this framework compared to existing alternatives.</p>

Specifically, in image-to-text or image-to-image pipelines, opinion (sentiment) may be inadvertently learned by a model from human-generated image captions. Additionally, learning may be affected by the variety and diversity of the provided captions. While labelling large datasets has largely relied on crowd-sourcing or data-worker pools, evaluating the quality of such training data is crucial.
  This study proposes an evaluation method focused on sentiment and semantic richness. That method was applied to the COCO-MS dataset, comprising approximately 150K images with segmented objects and corresponding crowd-sourced captions. We employed pre-trained models (Twitter-RoBERTa-base and BERT-base) to extract sentiment scores and variability of semantic embeddings from captions. The relation of the sentiment score and semantic variability with object categories was examined using multiple linear regression. Results indicate that while most captions were neutral, about 6% of the captions exhibited strong sentiment influenced by specific object categories. Semantic variability of within-image captions remained low and uncorrelated with object categories. Model-generated captions showed less than 1.5% of strong sentiment which was not influenced by object categories and did not correlate with the sentiment of the respective human-generated captions. This research demonstrates an approach to assess the quality of crowd- or worker-sourced captions informed by image content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joe Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates have risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belong to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia DR3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an AUC of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyue Shi, Linming Zhou, Yuhui Huang, Yongjun Wu, Zijian Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the dynamic and rapidly advancing battery field, alloy anode materials are a focal point due to their superior electrochemical performance. Traditional screening methods are inefficient and time-consuming. Our research introduces a machine learning-assisted strategy to expedite the discovery and optimization of these materials. We compiled a vast dataset from the MP and AFLOW databases, encompassing tens of thousands of alloy compositions and properties. Utilizing a CGCNN, we accurately predicted the potential and specific capacity of alloy anodes, validated against experimental data. This approach identified approximately 120 low potential and high specific capacity alloy anodes suitable for various battery systems including Li, Na, K, Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al-based. Our method not only streamlines the screening of battery anode materials but also propels the advancement of battery material research and innovation in energy storage technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Judy Hanwen Shen, Archit Sharma, Jun Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p>

We propose a multimodal framework that improves domain generalization by integrating motion, audio, and appearance features. Key contributions include analyzing the resilience of audio and motion features to domain shifts, using audio narrations for enhanced audio-text alignment, and applying consistency ratings between audio and visual narrations to optimize the impact of audio in recognition during training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ARGO1M dataset, effectively generalizing across unseen scenarios and locations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recognizing texts from camera images is a known hard problem because of the difficulties in text detection from the varied and complicated background. In this paper we propose a novel and efficient method to detect text region from images with complex background using Wavelet Transforms. The framework uses Wavelet Transformation of the original image in its grayscale form followed by Sub-band filtering. Then Region clustering technique is applied using centroids of the regions, further Bounding box is fitted to each region thus identifying the text regions. This method is much sophisticated and efficient than the previous methods as it doesn't stick to a particular font size of the text thus, making it generalized. The sample set used for experimental purpose consists of 50 images with varying backgrounds. Images with edge prominence are considered. Furthermore, our method can be easily customized for applications with different scopes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong Yang, Zhan Liu, Wenyi Yu, Guangzhi Sun, Qiuqiang Kong, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable results in speech and vocal enhancement due to their ability to model complex speech data distributions. While these models generalize well to unseen acoustic environments, they may not achieve the same level of fidelity as the discriminative models specifically trained to enhance particular acoustic conditions. In this paper, we propose Ex-Diff, a novel score-based diffusion model that integrates the latent representations produced by a discriminative model to improve speech and vocal enhancement, which combines the strengths of both generative and discriminative models. Experimental results on the widely used MUSDB dataset show relative improvements of 3.7% in SI-SDR and 10.0% in SI-SIR compared to the baseline diffusion model for speech and vocal enhancement tasks, respectively. Additionally, case studies are provided to further illustrate and analyze the complementary nature of generative and discriminative models in this context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative diffusions are a powerful class of Monte Carlo samplers that leverage bridging Markov processes to approximate complex, high-dimensional distributions, such as those found in image processing and language models. Despite their success in these domains, an important open challenge remains: extending these techniques to sample from conditional distributions, as required in, for example, Bayesian inverse problems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing computational approaches to conditional sampling within generative diffusion models. Specifically, we highlight key methodologies that either utilise the joint distribution, or rely on (pre-trained) marginal distributions with explicit likelihoods, to construct conditional generative samplers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Israrul H. Hashmi,  Himanshu, Rahul Karmakar, Tarak K Patra</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models have been progressively used for predicting materials properties. These models can be built using pre-existing data and are useful for rapidly screening the physicochemical space of a material, which is astronomically large. However, ML models are inherently interpolative, and their efficacy for searching candidates outside a material's known range of property is unresolved. Moreover, the performance of an ML model is intricately connected to its learning strategy and the volume of training data. Here, we determine the relationship between the extrapolation ability of an ML model, the size and range of its training dataset, and its learning approach. We focus on a canonical problem of predicting the properties of a copolymer as a function of the sequence of its monomers. Tree search algorithms, which learn the similarity between polymer structures, are found to be inefficient for extrapolation. Conversely, the extrapolation capability of neural networks and XGBoost models, which attempt to learn the underlying functional correlation between the structure and property of polymers, show strong correlations with the volume and range of training data. These findings have important implications on ML-based new material development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhusudan Ghosh, Shrimon Mukherjee, Asmit Ganguly, Partha Basuchowdhuri, Sudip Kumar Naskar, Debasis Ganguly</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in the publication of clinical trial reports, making it challenging to conduct systematic reviews. Automatically extracting Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) from clinical trial studies can alleviate the traditionally time-consuming process of manually scrutinizing systematic reviews. Existing approaches of PICO frame extraction involves supervised approach that relies on the existence of manually annotated data points in the form of BIO label tagging. Recent approaches, such as In-Context Learning (ICL), which has been shown to be effective for a number of downstream NLP tasks, require the use of labeled examples. In this work, we adopt ICL strategy by employing the pretrained knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), gathered during the pretraining phase of an LLM, to automatically extract the PICO-related terminologies from clinical trial documents in unsupervised set up to bypass the availability of large number of annotated data instances. Additionally, to showcase the highest effectiveness of LLM in oracle scenario where large number of annotated samples are available, we adopt the instruction tuning strategy by employing Low Rank Adaptation (LORA) to conduct the training of gigantic model in low resource environment for the PICO frame extraction task. Our empirical results show that our proposed ICL-based framework produces comparable results on all the version of EBM-NLP datasets and the proposed instruction tuned version of our framework produces state-of-the-art results on all the different EBM-NLP datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning-Chi Huang, Chi-Chih Chang, Wei-Cheng Lin, Endri Taka, Diana Marculescu, Kai-Chiang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: $N{:}M$ sparsity is an emerging model compression method supported by more and more accelerators to speed up sparse matrix multiplication in deep neural networks. Most existing $N{:}M$ sparsity methods compress neural networks with a uniform setting for all layers in a network or heuristically determine the layer-wise configuration by considering the number of parameters in each layer. However, very few methods have been designed for obtaining a layer-wise customized $N{:}M$ sparse configuration for vision transformers (ViTs), which usually consist of transformer blocks involving the same number of parameters. In this work, to address the challenge of selecting suitable sparse configuration for ViTs on $N{:}M$ sparsity-supporting accelerators, we propose ELSA, Exploiting Layer-wise $N{:}M$ Sparsity for ViTs. Considering not only all $N{:}M$ sparsity levels supported by a given accelerator but also the expected throughput improvement, our methodology can reap the benefits of accelerators supporting mixed sparsity by trading off negligible accuracy loss with both memory usage and inference time reduction for ViT models. For instance, our approach achieves a noteworthy 2.9$\times$ reduction in FLOPs for both Swin-B and DeiT-B with only a marginal degradation of accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recency bias in a sequential recommendation system refers to the overly high emphasis placed on recent items within a user session. This bias can diminish the serendipity of recommendations and hinder the system's ability to capture users' long-term interests, leading to user disengagement. We propose a simple yet effective novel metric specifically designed to quantify recency bias. Our findings also demonstrate that high recency bias measured in our proposed metric adversely impacts recommendation performance too, and mitigating it results in improved recommendation performances across all models evaluated in our experiments, thus highlighting the importance of measuring recency bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating out-of-sample risk for models trained on large high-dimensional datasets is an expensive but essential part of the machine learning process, enabling practitioners to optimally tune hyperparameters. Cross-validation (CV) serves as the de facto standard for risk estimation but poorly trades off high bias ($K$-fold CV) for computational cost (leave-one-out CV). We propose a randomized approximate leave-one-out (RandALO) risk estimator that is not only a consistent estimator of risk in high dimensions but also less computationally expensive than $K$-fold CV. We support our claims with extensive simulations on synthetic and real data and provide a user-friendly Python package implementing RandALO available on PyPI as randalo and at https://github.com/cvxgrp/randalo.</p>

This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a Federated Learning (FL) testbed, focusing on its application in cybersecurity and evaluating its resilience against poisoning attacks. Federated Learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model while keeping their data decentralized, addressing critical needs for data privacy and security, particularly in sensitive fields like cybersecurity. Our testbed, built using the Flower framework, facilitates experimentation with various FL frameworks, assessing their performance, scalability, and ease of integration. Through a case study on federated intrusion detection systems, we demonstrate the testbed's capabilities in detecting anomalies and securing critical infrastructure without exposing sensitive network data. Comprehensive poisoning tests, targeting both model and data integrity, evaluate the system's robustness under adversarial conditions. Our results show that while federated learning enhances data privacy and distributed learning, it remains vulnerable to poisoning attacks, which must be mitigated to ensure its reliability in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a system that generates synthetic free-text medical records, such as discharge summaries, admission notes and doctor correspondences, using Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Our system is designed to preserve the critical information of the records while introducing significant diversity and minimizing re-identification risk. The system incorporates a de-identification component that uses Philter to mask Protected Health Information (PHI), followed by a Medical Entity Recognition (NER) model to retain key medical information. We explore various masking ratios and mask-filling techniques to balance the trade-off between diversity and fidelity in the synthetic outputs without affecting overall readability. Our results demonstrate that the system can produce high-quality synthetic data with significant diversity while achieving a HIPAA-compliant PHI recall rate of 0.96 and a low re-identification risk of 0.035. Furthermore, downstream evaluations using a NER task reveal that the synthetic data can be effectively used to train models with performance comparable to those trained on real data. The flexibility of the system allows it to be adapted for specific use cases, making it a valuable tool for privacy-preserving data generation in medical research and healthcare applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accessing and comprehending religious texts, particularly the Quran (the sacred scripture of Islam) and Ahadith (the corpus of the sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad), in today's digital era necessitates efficient and accurate Question-Answering (QA) systems. Yet, the scarcity of QA systems tailored specifically to the detailed nature of inquiries about the Quranic Tafsir (explanation, interpretation, context of Quran for clarity) and Ahadith poses significant challenges. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset meticulously crafted for QA purposes within the domain of Quranic Tafsir and Ahadith. This dataset comprises a robust collection of over 73,000 question-answer pairs, standing as the largest reported dataset in this specialized domain. Importantly, both questions and answers within the dataset are meticulously enriched with contextual information, serving as invaluable resources for training and evaluating tailored QA systems. However, while this paper highlights the dataset's contributions and establishes a benchmark for evaluating QA performance in the Quran and Ahadith domains, our subsequent human evaluation uncovered critical insights regarding the limitations of existing automatic evaluation techniques. The discrepancy between automatic evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE scores, and human assessments became apparent. The human evaluation indicated significant disparities: the model's verdict consistency with expert scholars ranged between 11% to 20%, while its contextual understanding spanned a broader spectrum of 50% to 90%. These findings underscore the necessity for evaluation techniques that capture the nuances and complexities inherent in understanding religious texts, surpassing the limitations of traditional automatic metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjong Ok, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Singing voice synthesis and conversion have emerged as significant subdomains of voice generation, leading to much demands on prompt-conditioned generation. Unlike common voice data, generating a singing voice requires an understanding of various associated vocal and musical characteristics, such as the vocal tone of the singer or emotional expressions. However, existing open-source audio-text datasets for voice generation tend to capture only a very limited range of attributes, often missing musical characteristics of the audio. To fill this gap, we introduce S2Cap, an audio-text pair dataset with a diverse set of attributes. S2Cap consists of pairs of textual prompts and music audio samples with a wide range of vocal and musical attributes, including pitch, volume, tempo, mood, singer's gender and age, and musical genre and emotional expression. Utilizing S2Cap, we suggest an effective novel baseline algorithm for singing style captioning. Singing style captioning is a relative task to voice generation that generates text descriptions of vocal characteristics, which we first suggested. First, to mitigate the misalignment between the audio encoder and the text decoder, we present a novel mechanism called CRESCENDO, which utilizes positive-pair similarity learning to synchronize the embedding spaces of a pretrained audio encoder to get similar embeddings with a text encoder. We additionally supervise the model using the singer's voice, which is demixed by the accompaniment. This supervision allows the model to more accurately capture vocal characteristics, leading to improved singing style captions that better reflect the style of the singer. The dataset and the codes are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/S2cap}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vitor Guizilini, Pavel Tokmakov, Achal Dave, Rares Ambrus</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction from a single image is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Learning-based methods address its inherent scale ambiguity by leveraging increasingly large labeled and unlabeled datasets, to produce geometric priors capable of generating accurate predictions across domains. As a result, state of the art approaches show impressive performance in zero-shot relative and metric depth estimation. Recently, diffusion models have exhibited remarkable scalability and generalizable properties in their learned representations. However, because these models repurpose tools originally designed for image generation, they can only operate on dense ground-truth, which is not available for most depth labels, especially in real-world settings. In this paper we present GRIN, an efficient diffusion model designed to ingest sparse unstructured training data. We use image features with 3D geometric positional encodings to condition the diffusion process both globally and locally, generating depth predictions at a pixel-level. With comprehensive experiments across eight indoor and outdoor datasets, we show that GRIN establishes a new state of the art in zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation even when trained from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Bing, Florentina Bunea, Jonathan Niles-Weed, Marten Wegkamp</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed multinomial logits are discrete mixtures introduced several decades ago to model the probability of choosing an attribute from $p$ possible candidates, in heterogeneous populations. The model has recently attracted attention in the AI literature, under the name softmax mixtures, where it is routinely used in the final layer of a neural network to map a large number $p$ of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^L$ to a probability vector. Despite its wide applicability and empirical success, statistically optimal estimators of the mixture parameters, obtained via algorithms whose running time scales polynomially in $L$, are not known. This paper provides a solution to this problem for contemporary applications, such as large language models, in which the mixture has a large number $p$ of support points, and the size $N$ of the sample observed from the mixture is also large. Our proposed estimator combines two classical estimators, obtained respectively via a method of moments (MoM) and the expectation-minimization (EM) algorithm. Although both estimator types have been studied, from a theoretical perspective, for Gaussian mixtures, no similar results exist for softmax mixtures for either procedure. We develop a new MoM parameter estimator based on latent moment estimation that is tailored to our model, and provide the first theoretical analysis for a MoM-based procedure in softmax mixtures. Although consistent, MoM for softmax mixtures can exhibit poor numerical performance, as observed other mixture models. Nevertheless, as MoM is provably in a neighborhood of the target, it can be used as warm start for any iterative algorithm. We study in detail the EM algorithm, and provide its first theoretical analysis for softmax mixtures. Our final proposal for parameter estimation is the EM algorithm with a MoM warm start.</p>

However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that the proposed methods achieve a sample complexity and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop methods with provable complexity guarantees for finding an approximate stochastic stationary point of such problems that nearly satisfies all constraints with certainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Chu, Daoud Burghal, Michael Neuman, Andreas F. Molisch</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving reliable multidimensional Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) channel state information (CSI) prediction is both challenging and crucial for optimizing downstream tasks that depend on instantaneous CSI. This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Chen, Jiangnan Zhu, Yujie Gu, Minoru Kuribayashi, Kouichi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in real-world applications. However, safeguarding their intellectual property (IP) remains extremely challenging. Existing DNN watermarking for IP protection often require modifying DNN models, which reduces model performance and limits their practicality.
  This paper introduces FreeMark, a novel DNN watermarking framework that leverages cryptographic principles without altering the original host DNN model, thereby avoiding any reduction in model performance. Unlike traditional DNN watermarking methods, FreeMark innovatively generates secret keys from a pre-generated watermark vector and the host model using gradient descent. These secret keys, used to extract watermark from the model's activation values, are securely stored with a trusted third party, enabling reliable watermark extraction from suspect models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeMark effectively resists various watermark removal attacks while maintaining high watermark capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satsuki Nishimura, Coh Miyao, Hajime Otsuka</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based search strategy to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The reinforcement learning, which is one of machine learning methods, is a powerful approach to find model parameters with phenomenological constraints. As a concrete example, we focus on a minimal axion model with a global $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Agents of the learning succeed in finding $U(1)$ charge assignments of quarks and leptons solving the flavor and cosmological puzzles in the Standard Model, and find more than 150 realistic solutions for the quark sector taking renormalization effects into account. For the solutions found by the reinforcement learning-based analysis, we discuss the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of an axion which is a Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken $U(1)$. We also examine how fast the reinforcement learning-based searching method finds the best discrete parameters in comparison with conventional optimization methods. In conclusion, the efficient parameter search based on the reinforcement learning-based strategy enables us to perform a statistical analysis of the vast parameter space associated with the axion model from flavor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Yang Yuan, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diagram of Thought (DoT), a framework that models iterative reasoning in large language models (LLMs) as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single model. Unlike traditional approaches that represent reasoning as linear chains or trees, DoT organizes propositions, critiques, refinements, and verifications into a cohesive DAG structure, allowing the model to explore complex reasoning pathways while maintaining logical consistency. Each node in the diagram corresponds to a proposition that has been proposed, critiqued, refined, or verified, enabling the LLM to iteratively improve its reasoning through natural language feedback. By leveraging auto-regressive next-token prediction with role-specific tokens, DoT facilitates seamless transitions between proposing ideas and critically evaluating them, providing richer feedback than binary signals. Furthermore, we formalize the DoT framework using Topos Theory, providing a mathematical foundation that ensures logical consistency and soundness in the reasoning process. This approach enhances both the training and inference processes within a single LLM, eliminating the need for multiple models or external control mechanisms. DoT offers a conceptual framework for designing next-generation reasoning-specialized models, emphasizing training efficiency, robust reasoning capabilities, and theoretical grounding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Fang, Qinghua Tao, Zuopeng Yang, Xiaolin Huang, Jie Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection determines whether the given samples are from the training distribution of the classifier-under-protection, i.e., the In-Distribution (InD), or from a different OoD. Latest researches introduce diffusion models pre-trained on InD data to advocate OoD detection by transferring an OoD image into a generated one that is close to InD, so that one could capture the distribution disparities between original and generated images to detect OoD data. Existing diffusion-based detectors adopt perceptual metrics on the two images to measure such disparities, but ignore a fundamental fact: Perceptual metrics are devised essentially for human-perceived similarities of low-level image patterns, e.g., textures and colors, and are not advisable in evaluating distribution disparities, since images with different low-level patterns could possibly come from the same distribution. To address this issue, we formulate a diffusion-based detection framework that considers the distribution similarity between a tested image and its generated counterpart via a novel proper similarity metric in the informative feature space and probability space learned by the classifier-under-protection. An anomaly-removal strategy is further presented to enlarge such distribution disparities by removing abnormal OoD information in the feature space to facilitate the detection. Extensive empirical results unveil the insufficiency of perceptual metrics and the effectiveness of our distribution similarity framework with new state-of-the-art detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Fraunholz, Dennis Rall, Tim K\"ohler, Alfons Schuster, Monika Mayer, Lars Larsen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of industrial manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing an increasing role, from automating existing processes to aiding in the development of new materials and techniques. However, a significant challenge arises in smaller, experimental processes characterized by limited training data availability, questioning the possibility to train AI models in such small data contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of Transfer Learning to address this challenge, specifically investigating the minimum amount of data required to develop a functional AI model. For this purpose, we consider the use case of quality control of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) tape laying in aerospace manufacturing using optical sensors. We investigate the behavior of different open-source computer vision models with a continuous reduction of the training data. Our results show that the amount of data required to successfully train an AI model can be drastically reduced, and the use of smaller models does not necessarily lead to a loss of performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedasri Nakka, Andreas Fischer, Rolf Ingold, Lars Vogtlin</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis investigates the effectiveness of SimCLR, a contrastive learning technique, in Greek letter recognition, focusing on the impact of various augmentation techniques. We pretrain the SimCLR backbone using the Alpub dataset (pretraining dataset) and fine-tune it on a smaller ICDAR dataset (finetuning dataset) to compare SimCLR's performance against traditional baseline models, which use cross-entropy and triplet loss functions. Additionally, we explore the role of different data augmentation strategies, essential for the SimCLR training process. Methodologically, we examine three primary approaches: (1) a baseline model using cross-entropy loss, (2) a triplet embedding model with a classification layer, and (3) a SimCLR pretrained model with a classification layer. Initially, we train the baseline, triplet, and SimCLR models using 93 augmentations on ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 networks with the ICDAR dataset. From these, the top four augmentations are selected using a statistical t-test. Pretraining of SimCLR is conducted on the Alpub dataset, followed by fine-tuning on the ICDAR dataset. The triplet loss model undergoes a similar process, being pretrained on the top four augmentations before fine-tuning on ICDAR. Our experiments show that SimCLR does not outperform the baselines in letter recognition tasks. The baseline model with cross-entropy loss demonstrates better performance than both SimCLR and the triplet loss model. This study provides a detailed evaluation of contrastive learning for letter recognition, highlighting SimCLR's limitations while emphasizing the strengths of traditional supervised learning models in this task. We believe SimCLR's cropping strategies may cause a semantic shift in the input image, reducing training effectiveness despite the large pretraining dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Squillace, Mirco Tribastone, Max Tschaikowski, Andrea Vandin</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural network embedding is a crucial step in enabling effective downstream tasks for complex systems that aims to project a network into a lower-dimensional space while preserving similarities among nodes. We introduce a simple and efficient embedding technique based on approximate variants of equitable partitions. The approximation consists in introducing a user-tunable tolerance parameter relaxing the otherwise strict condition for exact equitable partitions that can be hardly found in real-world networks. We exploit a relationship between equitable partitions and equivalence relations for Markov chains and ordinary differential equations to develop a partition refinement algorithm for computing an approximate equitable partition in polynomial time. We compare our method against state-of-the-art embedding techniques on benchmark networks. We report comparable -- when not superior -- performance for visualization, classification, and regression tasks at a cost between one and three orders of magnitude smaller using a prototype implementation, enabling the embedding of large-scale networks which could not be efficiently handled by most of the competing techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sim2Real transfer, particularly for manipulation policies relying on RGB images, remains a critical challenge in robotics due to the significant domain shift between synthetic and real-world visual data. In this paper, we propose SplatSim, a novel framework that leverages Gaussian Splatting as the primary rendering primitive to reduce the Sim2Real gap for RGB-based manipulation policies. By replacing traditional mesh representations with Gaussian Splats in simulators, SplatSim produces highly photorealistic synthetic data while maintaining the scalability and cost-efficiency of simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by training manipulation policies within SplatSim}and deploying them in the real world in a zero-shot manner, achieving an average success rate of 86.25%, compared to 97.5% for policies trained on real-world data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safe learning of control policies remains challenging, both in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this article, we consider safe learning of parametrized predictive controllers that operate with incomplete information about the underlying process. To this end, we employ Bayesian optimization for learning the best parameters from closed-loop data. Our method focuses on the system's overall long-term performance in closed-loop while keeping it safe and stable. Specifically, we parametrize the stage cost function of an MPC using a feedforward neural network. This allows for a high degree of flexibility, enabling the system to achieve a better closed-loop performance with respect to a superordinate measure. However, this flexibility also necessitates safety measures, especially with respect to closed-loop stability. To this end, we explicitly incorporated stability information in the Bayesian-optimization-based learning procedure, thereby achieving rigorous probabilistic safety guarantees. The proposed approach is illustrated using a numeric example.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in robotic learning in simulation have shown impressive results in accelerating learning complex manipulation skills. However, the sim-to-real gap, caused by discrepancies between simulation and reality, poses significant challenges for the effective deployment of autonomous surgical systems. We propose a novel approach utilizing image translation models to mitigate domain mismatches and facilitate efficient robot skill learning in a simulated environment. Our method involves the use of contrastive unpaired Image-to-image translation, allowing for the acquisition of embedded representations from these transformed images. Subsequently, these embeddings are used to improve the efficiency of training surgical manipulation models. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of our approach, demonstrating that it significantly enhances task success rates and reduces the steps required for task completion compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that our proposed system effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, providing a robust framework for advancing the autonomy of surgical robots in minimally invasive procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Xin Liu, Songming Zhu, Zhanwen Li, Lina Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology has facilitated the effective capture of traffic-induced seismic data. The traffic-induced seismic wave is a prominent contributor to urban vibrations and contain crucial information to advance urban exploration and governance. However, identifying vehicular movements within massive noisy data poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a real-time semi-supervised vehicle monitoring framework tailored to urban settings. It requires only a small fraction of manual labels for initial training and exploits unlabeled data for model improvement. Additionally, the framework can autonomously adapt to newly collected unlabeled data. Before DAS data undergo object detection as two-dimensional images to preserve spatial information, we leveraged comprehensive one-dimensional signal preprocessing to mitigate noise. Furthermore, we propose a novel prior loss that incorporates the shapes of vehicular traces to track a single vehicle with varying speeds. To evaluate our model, we conducted experiments with seismic data from the Stanford 2 DAS Array. The results showed that our model outperformed the baseline model Efficient Teacher and its supervised counterpart, YOLO (You Only Look Once), in both accuracy and robustness. With only 35 labeled images, our model surpassed YOLO's mAP 0.5:0.95 criterion by 18% and showed a 7% increase over Efficient Teacher. We conducted comparative experiments with multiple update strategies for self-updating and identified an optimal approach. This approach surpasses the performance of non-overfitting training conducted with all data in a single pass.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale semantic segmentation networks often achieve high performance, while their application can be challenging when faced with limited sample sizes and computational resources. In scenarios with restricted network size and computational complexity, models encounter significant challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and recovering detailed information in images. We propose a lightweight bilateral semantic segmentation network called bilateral attention fusion network (BAFNet) to efficiently segment high-resolution urban remote sensing images. The model consists of two paths, namely dependency path and remote-local path. The dependency path utilizes large kernel attention to acquire long-range dependencies in the image. Besides, multi-scale local attention and efficient remote attention are designed to construct remote-local path. Finally, a feature aggregation module is designed to effectively utilize the different features of the two paths. Our proposed method was tested on public high-resolution urban remote sensing datasets Vaihingen and Potsdam, with mIoU reaching 83.20% and 86.53%, respectively. As a lightweight semantic segmentation model, BAFNet not only outperforms advanced lightweight models in accuracy but also demonstrates comparable performance to non-lightweight state-of-the-art methods on two datasets, despite a tenfold variance in floating-point operations and a fifteenfold difference in network parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and robust medical image classification is a challenging task, especially in application domains where available annotated datasets are small and present high imbalance between target classes. Considering that data acquisition is not always feasible, especially for underrepresented classes, our approach introduces a novel synthetic augmentation strategy using class-specific Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and latent space interpolation to improve discrimination capabilities.
  By generating realistic, varied synthetic data that fills feature space gaps, we address issues of data scarcity and class imbalance. The method presented in this paper relies on the interpolation of latent representations within each class, thus enriching the training set and improving the model's generalizability and diagnostic accuracy. The proposed strategy was tested in a small dataset of 321 images created to train and validate an automatic method for assessing the quality of cleanliness of esophagogastroduodenoscopy images. By combining real and synthetic data, an increase of over 18\% in the accuracy of the most challenging underrepresented class was observed. The proposed strategy not only benefited the underrepresented class but also led to a general improvement in other metrics, including a 6\% increase in global accuracy and precision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Verification and validation of autonomous driving (AD) systems and components is of increasing importance, as such technology increases in real-world prevalence. Safety-critical scenario generation is a key approach to robustify AD policies through closed-loop training. However, existing approaches for scenario generation rely on simplistic objectives, resulting in overly-aggressive or non-reactive adversarial behaviors. To generate diverse adversarial yet realistic scenarios, we propose SEAL, a scenario perturbation approach which leverages learned scoring functions and adversarial, human-like skills. SEAL-perturbed scenarios are more realistic than SOTA baselines, leading to improved ego task success across real-world, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution scenarios, of more than 20%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Kornowski, Swati Padmanabhan, Ohad Shamir</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, with the algorithm assumed to have access only to local function information. It has been shown by Davis, Drusvyatskiy, and Jiang (2023) that for nonsmooth Lipschitz functions satisfying certain regularity and strictness conditions, perturbed gradient descent converges to local minimizers asymptotically. Motivated by this result and by other recent algorithmic advances in nonconvex nonsmooth optimization concerning Goldstein stationarity, we consider the question of obtaining a non-asymptotic rate of convergence to local minima for this problem class.
  We provide the following negative answer to this question: Local algorithms acting on regular Lipschitz functions cannot, in the worst case, provide meaningful local guarantees in terms of function value in sub-exponential time, even when all near-stationary points are global minima. This sharply contrasts with the smooth setting, for which it is well-known that standard gradient methods can do so in a dimension-independent rate. Our result complements the rich body of work in the theoretical computer science literature that provide hardness results conditional on conjectures such as $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ or cryptographic assumptions, in that ours holds unconditional of any such assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Mark Thomas, Sharu Theresa Jose</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid quantum generative model, the VAE-QWGAN, which combines the strengths of a classical Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with a hybrid Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (QWGAN). The VAE-QWGAN integrates the VAE decoder and QGAN generator into a single quantum model with shared parameters, utilizing the VAE's encoder for latent vector sampling during training. To generate new data from the trained model at inference, input latent vectors are sampled from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), learnt on the training latent vectors. This, in turn, enhances the diversity and quality of generated images. We evaluate the model's performance on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets, and demonstrate improved quality and diversity of generated images compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> T\'eo Guichoux, Laure Soulier, Nicolas Obin, Catherine Pelachaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-speech gestures are fundamental for communication. The advent of recent deep learning techniques has facilitated the creation of lifelike, synchronous co-speech gestures for Embodied Conversational Agents. "In-the-wild" datasets, aggregating video content from platforms like YouTube via human pose detection technologies, provide a feasible solution by offering 2D skeletal sequences aligned with speech. Concurrent developments in lifting models enable the conversion of these 2D sequences into 3D gesture databases. However, it is important to note that the 3D poses estimated from the 2D extracted poses are, in essence, approximations of the ground-truth, which remains in the 2D domain. This distinction raises questions about the impact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated motions - a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. Our study examines the effect of using either 2D or 3D joint coordinates as training data on the performance of speech-to-gesture deep generative models. We employ a lifting model for converting generated 2D pose sequences into 3D and assess how gestures created directly in 3D stack up against those initially generated in 2D and then converted to 3D. We perform an objective evaluation using widely used metrics in the gesture generation field as well as a user study to qualitatively evaluate the different approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp-force predictions and force control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article, we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual-CNN) architecture which incorporating a physics-based mechanics module for learning target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can be effectively applied in vision-based tactile sensors and enables gentle and stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments, and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour</p>
<p>Abstract: The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way, clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Bohne, David Rosenberg, Gary Kazantsev, Pawel Polak</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilevel optimization methods are increasingly relevant within machine learning, especially for tasks such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Compared to the offline setting, online bilevel optimization (OBO) offers a more dynamic framework by accommodating time-varying functions and sequentially arriving data. This study addresses the online nonconvex-strongly convex bilevel optimization problem. In deterministic settings, we introduce a novel online Bregman bilevel optimizer (OBBO) that utilizes adaptive Bregman divergences. We demonstrate that OBBO enhances the known sublinear rates for bilevel local regret through a novel hypergradient error decomposition that adapts to the underlying geometry of the problem. In stochastic contexts, we introduce the first stochastic online bilevel optimizer (SOBBO), which employs a window averaging method for updating outer-level variables using a weighted average of recent stochastic approximations of hypergradients. This approach not only achieves sublinear rates of bilevel local regret but also serves as an effective variance reduction strategy, obviating the need for additional stochastic gradient samples at each timestep. Experiments on online hyperparameter optimization and online meta-learning highlight the superior performance, efficiency, and adaptability of our Bregman-based algorithms compared to established online and offline bilevel benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuetong Wu, Mingming Gong, Jonathan H. Manton, Uwe Aickelin, Jingge Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly incorporating causality, have led to significant methodological improvements in these learning problems. However, a formal theory that explains the role of causality in the generalization performance of UDA/SSL is still lacking. In this paper, we consider the UDA/SSL scenarios where we access $m$ labelled source data and $n$ unlabelled target data as training instances under different causal settings with a parametric probabilistic model. We study the learning performance (e.g., excess risk) of prediction in the target domain from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we distinguish two scenarios: the learning problem is called causal learning if the feature is the cause and the label is the effect, and is called anti-causal learning otherwise. We show that in causal learning, the excess risk depends on the size of the source sample at a rate of $O(\frac{1}{m})$ only if the labelling distribution between the source and target domains remains unchanged. In anti-causal learning, we show that the unlabelled data dominate the performance at a rate of typically $O(\frac{1}{n})$. These results bring out the relationship between the data sample size and the hardness of the learning problem with different causal mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Kalinke, Marco Heyden, Georg Gntuni, Edouard Fouch\'e, Klemens B\"ohm</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting changes is of fundamental importance when analyzing data streams and has many applications, e.g., in predictive maintenance, fraud detection, or medicine. A principled approach to detect changes is to compare the distributions of observations within the stream to each other via hypothesis testing. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a (semi-)metric on the space of probability distributions, provides powerful non-parametric two-sample tests on kernel-enriched domains. In particular, MMD is able to detect any disparity between distributions under mild conditions. However, classical MMD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which renders their direct use for change detection in data streams impractical. In this article, we propose a new change detection algorithm, called Maximum Mean Discrepancy on Exponential Windows (MMDEW), that combines the benefits of MMD with an efficient computation based on exponential windows. We prove that MMDEW enjoys polylogarithmic runtime and logarithmic memory complexity and show empirically that it outperforms the state of the art on benchmark data streams.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Orlova, Haokun Liu, Raphael Rossellini, Benjamin A. Cash, Rebecca Willett</p>
<p>Abstract: Producing high-quality forecasts of key climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, on subseasonal time scales has long been a gap in operational forecasting. This study explores an application of machine learning (ML) models as post-processing tools for subseasonal forecasting. Lagged numerical ensemble forecasts (i.e., an ensemble where the members have different initialization dates) and observational data, including relative humidity, pressure at sea level, and geopotential height, are incorporated into various ML methods to predict monthly average precipitation and two-meter temperature two weeks in advance for the continental United States. For regression, quantile regression, and tercile classification tasks, we consider using linear models, random forests, convolutional neural networks, and stacked models (a multi-model approach based on the prediction of the individual ML models). Unlike previous ML approaches that often use ensemble mean alone, we leverage information embedded in the ensemble forecasts to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we investigate extreme event predictions that are crucial for planning and mitigation efforts. Considering ensemble members as a collection of spatial forecasts, we explore different approaches to using spatial information. Trade-offs between different approaches may be mitigated with model stacking. Our proposed models outperform standard baselines such as climatological forecasts and ensemble means. In addition, we investigate feature importance, trade-offs between using the full ensemble or only the ensemble mean, and different modes of accounting for spatial variability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hrushikesh Mhaskar</p>
<p>Abstract: For the past 30 years or so, machine learning has stimulated a great deal of research in the study of approximation capabilities (expressive power) of a multitude of processes, such as approximation by shallow or deep neural networks, radial basis function networks, and a variety of kernel based methods. Motivated by applications such as invariant learning, transfer learning, and synthetic aperture radar imaging, we initiate in this paper a general approach to study the approximation capabilities of kernel based networks using non-symmetric kernels. While singular value decomposition is a natural instinct to study such kernels, we consider a more general approach to include the use of a family of kernels, such as generalized translation networks (which include neural networks and translation invariant kernels as special cases) and rotated zonal function kernels. Naturally, unlike traditional kernel based approximation, we cannot require the kernels to be positive definite. In particular, we obtain estimates on the accuracy of uniform approximation of functions in a Sobolev class by ReLU$^r$ networks when $r$ is not necessarily an integer. Our general results apply to the approximation of functions with small smoothness compared to the dimension of the input space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fast and reliable state estimation and tracking are essential for real-time situation awareness in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) operating in tactical environments or complicated civilian environments. Traditional centralized solutions do not scale well whereas existing fully distributed solutions over large networks suffer slow convergence, and are vulnerable to a wide spectrum of communication failures. In this paper, we aim to speed up the convergence and enhance the resilience of state estimation and tracking for large-scale networks using a simple hierarchical system architecture.
  We propose two ``consensus + innovation'' algorithms, both of which rely on a novel hierarchical push-sum consensus component. We characterize their convergence rates under a linear local observation model and minimal technical assumptions. We numerically validate our algorithms through simulation studies of underwater acoustic networks and large-scale synthetic networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Determining the degree of confidence of deep learning model in its prediction is an open problem in the field of natural language processing. Most of the classical methods for uncertainty estimation are quite weak for text classification models. We set the task of obtaining an uncertainty estimate for neural networks based on the Transformer architecture. A key feature of such mo-dels is the attention mechanism, which supports the information flow between the hidden representations of tokens in the neural network. We explore the formed relationships between internal representations using Topological Data Analysis methods and utilize them to predict model's confidence. In this paper, we propose a method for uncertainty estimation based on the topological properties of the attention mechanism and compare it with classical methods. As a result, the proposed algorithm surpasses the existing methods in quality and opens up a new area of application of the attention mechanism, but requires the selection of topological features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Palmer, Chris Parry, Daniel J. B. Harrold, Chris Willis</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of cyber-attacks in recent years raises the need for principled methods for defending networks against malicious actors. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating these attacks. However, while DRL has shown much potential for cyber defence, numerous challenges must be overcome before DRL can be applied to autonomous cyber operations (ACO) at scale. Principled methods are required for environments that confront learners with very high-dimensional state spaces, large multi-discrete action spaces, and adversarial learning. Recent works have reported success in solving these problems individually. There have also been impressive engineering efforts towards solving all three for real-time strategy games. However, applying DRL to the full ACO problem remains an open challenge. Here, we survey the relevant DRL literature and conceptualize an idealised ACO-DRL agent. We provide: i.) A summary of the domain properties that define the ACO problem; ii.) A comprehensive comparison of current ACO environments used for benchmarking DRL approaches; iii.) An overview of state-of-the-art approaches for scaling DRL to domains that confront learners with the curse of dimensionality, and; iv.) A survey and critique of current methods for limiting the exploitability of agents within adversarial settings from the perspective of ACO. We conclude with open research questions that we hope will motivate future directions for researchers and practitioners working on ACO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runqi Lin, Chaojian Yu, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Overfitting negatively impacts the generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in both natural and adversarial training. Existing methods struggle to consistently address different types of overfitting, typically designing strategies that focus separately on either natural or adversarial patterns. In this work, we adopt a unified perspective by solely focusing on natural patterns to explore different types of overfitting. Specifically, we examine the memorization effect in DNNs and reveal a shared behaviour termed over-memorization, which impairs their generalization capacity. This behaviour manifests as DNNs suddenly becoming high-confidence in predicting certain training patterns and retaining a persistent memory for them. Furthermore, when DNNs over-memorize an adversarial pattern, they tend to simultaneously exhibit high-confidence prediction for the corresponding natural pattern. These findings motivate us to holistically mitigate different types of overfitting by hindering the DNNs from over-memorization training patterns. To this end, we propose a general framework, Distraction Over-Memorization (DOM), which explicitly prevents over-memorization by either removing or augmenting the high-confidence natural patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in mitigating overfitting across various training paradigms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is the task of identifying abnormal samples in large unlabeled datasets. While the advent of foundation models has produced powerful zero-shot anomaly detection methods, their deployment in practice is often hindered by the absence of labeled validation data -- without it, their detection performance cannot be evaluated reliably. In this work, we propose SWSA (Selection With Synthetic Anomalies): a general-purpose framework to select image-based anomaly detectors without labeled validation data. Instead of collecting labeled validation data, we generate synthetic anomalies without any training or fine-tuning, using only a small support set of normal images. Our synthetic anomalies are used to create detection tasks that compose a validation framework for model selection. In an empirical study, we evaluate SWSA with three types of synthetic anomalies and on two selection tasks: model selection of image-based anomaly detectors and prompt selection for CLIP-based anomaly detection. SWSA often selects models and prompts that match selections made with a ground-truth validation set, outperforming baseline selection strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustavo Silva, Paul Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic optimizers play a crucial role in the successful training of deep neural network models. To achieve optimal model performance, designers must carefully select both model and optimizer hyperparameters. However, this process is frequently demanding in terms of computational resources and processing time. While it is a well-established practice to tune the entire set of optimizer hyperparameters for peak performance, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the individual influence of hyperparameters mislabeled as "low priority", including the safeguard factor $\epsilon$ and decay rate $\beta$, in leading adaptive stochastic optimizers like the Adam optimizer. In this manuscript, we introduce a new framework based on the empirical probability density function of the loss' gradient magnitude, termed as the "gradient magnitude histogram", for a thorough analysis of adaptive stochastic optimizers and the safeguard hyperparameter $\epsilon$. This framework reveals and justifies valuable relationships and dependencies among hyperparameters in connection to optimal performance across diverse tasks, such as classification, language modeling and machine translation. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm using gradient magnitude histograms to automatically estimate a refined and accurate search space for the optimal safeguard hyperparameter $\epsilon$, surpassing the conventional trial-and-error methodology by establishing a worst-case search space that is two times narrower.</p>

Moreover, our bound holds for arbitrary data-generating distributions on bounded instance spaces, even those without a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure, and the upper bound does not suffer from exponential dependencies.

In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG leverages a decoder to transform latent variables from a simple distribution into samples approximating the target Boltzmann distribution, while the diffusion-based encoder provides an accurate estimate of the Kullback-Leibler divergence during training. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of complex distribution tasks, outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Guo, Kaizhu Huang, Xinping Yi, Zixian Su, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we establish a theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our proposed SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers for time series forecasting mainly model time series from limited or fixed scales, making it challenging to capture different characteristics spanning various scales. We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Rodionov, Liudmila Prokhorenkova</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to capture computations with neural networks via learning the models to imitate the execution of classic algorithms. While common architectures are expressive enough to contain the correct model in the weights space, current neural reasoners are struggling to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, classic computations are not affected by distributional shifts as they can be described as transitions between discrete computational states. In this work, we propose to force neural reasoners to maintain the execution trajectory as a combination of finite predefined states. To achieve that, we separate discrete and continuous data flows and describe the interaction between them. Trained with supervision on the algorithm's state transitions, such models are able to perfectly align with the original algorithm. To show this, we evaluate our approach on multiple algorithmic problems and get perfect test scores both in single-task and multitask setups. Moreover, the proposed architectural choice allows us to prove the correctness of the learned algorithms for any test~data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saram Abbas, Rishad Shafik, Naeem Soomro, Rakesh Heer, Kabita Adhikari</p>
<p>Abstract: Notorious for its 70-80% recurrence rate, Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) imposes a significant human burden and is one of the costliest cancers to manage. Current tools for predicting NMIBC recurrence rely on scoring systems that often overestimate risk and have poor accuracy. This is where Machine learning (ML)-based techniques have emerged as a promising approach for predicting NMIBC recurrence by leveraging molecular and clinical data. This comprehensive review paper critically analyses ML-based frameworks for predicting NMIBC recurrence, focusing on their statistical robustness and algorithmic efficacy. We meticulously examine the strengths and weaknesses of each study, by focusing on various prediction tasks, data modalities, and ML models, highlighting their remarkable performance alongside inherent limitations. A diverse array of ML algorithms that leverage multimodal data spanning radiomics, clinical, histopathological, and genomic data, exhibit significant promise in accurately predicting NMIBC recurrence. However, the path to widespread adoption faces challenges concerning the generalisability and interpretability of models, emphasising the need for collaborative efforts, robust datasets, and the incorporation of cost-effectiveness. Our detailed categorisation and in-depth analysis illuminate the nuances, complexities, and contexts that influence real-world advancement and adoption of these AI-based techniques. This rigorous analysis equips researchers with a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the ML algorithms employed. Researchers can use these insights to refine approaches, address limitations, and boost generalisability of their ML models, ultimately leading to reduced healthcare costs and improved patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohd Halim Mohd Noor, Ayokunle Olalekan Ige</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a data-driven method that uses multiple layers of interconnected units (neurons) to learn intricate patterns and representations directly from raw input data. Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures. Finally, challenges and future directions in deep learning research are discussed to offer a broader perspective for future researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runqi Lin, Chaojian Yu, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-step adversarial training (SSAT) has demonstrated the potential to achieve both efficiency and robustness. However, SSAT suffers from catastrophic overfitting (CO), a phenomenon that leads to a severely distorted classifier, making it vulnerable to multi-step adversarial attacks. In this work, we observe that some adversarial examples generated on the SSAT-trained network exhibit anomalous behaviour, that is, although these training samples are generated by the inner maximization process, their associated loss decreases instead, which we named abnormal adversarial examples (AAEs). Upon further analysis, we discover a close relationship between AAEs and classifier distortion, as both the number and outputs of AAEs undergo a significant variation with the onset of CO. Given this observation, we re-examine the SSAT process and uncover that before the occurrence of CO, the classifier already displayed a slight distortion, indicated by the presence of few AAEs. Furthermore, the classifier directly optimizing these AAEs will accelerate its distortion, and correspondingly, the variation of AAEs will sharply increase as a result. In such a vicious circle, the classifier rapidly becomes highly distorted and manifests as CO within a few iterations. These observations motivate us to eliminate CO by hindering the generation of AAEs. Specifically, we design a novel method, termed Abnormal Adversarial Examples Regularization (AAER), which explicitly regularizes the variation of AAEs to hinder the classifier from becoming distorted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively eliminate CO and further boost adversarial robustness with negligible additional computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jef Jonkers, Glenn Van Wallendael, Luc Duchateau, Sofie Van Hoecke</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal Predictive Systems (CPS) offer a versatile framework for constructing predictive distributions, allowing for calibrated inference and informative decision-making. However, their applicability has been limited to scenarios adhering to the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) model assumption. This paper extends CPS to accommodate scenarios characterized by covariate shifts. We therefore propose Weighted CPS (WCPS), akin to Weighted Conformal Prediction (WCP), leveraging likelihood ratios between training and testing covariate distributions. This extension enables the construction of nonparametric predictive distributions capable of handling covariate shifts. We present theoretical underpinnings and conjectures regarding the validity and efficacy of WCPS and demonstrate its utility through empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our simulation experiments indicate that WCPS are probabilistically calibrated under covariate shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berat Dogan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods are employed to decrease data dimensionality, either to enhance machine learning performance or to facilitate data visualization in two or three-dimensional spaces. These methods typically fall into two categories: feature selection and feature transformation. Feature selection retains significant features, while feature transformation projects data into a lower-dimensional space, with linear and nonlinear methods. While nonlinear methods excel in preserving local structures and capturing nonlinear relationships, they may struggle with interpreting global structures and can be computationally intensive. Recent algorithms, such as the t-SNE, UMAP, TriMap, and PaCMAP prioritize preserving local structures, often at the expense of accurately representing global structures, leading to clusters being spread out more in lower-dimensional spaces. Moreover, these methods heavily rely on hyperparameters, making their results sensitive to parameter settings. To address these limitations, this study introduces a clustering-based approach, namely CBMAP (Clustering-Based Manifold Approximation and Projection), for dimensionality reduction. CBMAP aims to preserve both global and local structures, ensuring that clusters in lower-dimensional spaces closely resemble those in high-dimensional spaces. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate CBMAP's efficacy, offering speed, scalability, and minimal reliance on hyperparameters. Importantly, CBMAP enables low-dimensional projection of test data, addressing a critical need in machine learning applications. CBMAP is made freely available at https://github.com/doganlab/cbmap and can be installed from the Python Package Directory (PyPI) software repository with the command pip install cbmap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wu, Ziyu Shen, Feng Xie, Zhongyao Wang, Chunchen Liu, Yan Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical researchers and decision-makers spanning various domains frequently seek profound insights into the long-term impacts of interventions. While the significance of long-term outcomes is undeniable, an overemphasis on them may inadvertently overshadow short-term gains. Motivated by this, this paper formalizes a new framework for learning the optimal policy that effectively balances both long-term and short-term rewards, where some long-term outcomes are allowed to be missing. In particular, we first present the identifiability of both rewards under mild assumptions. Next, we deduce the semiparametric efficiency bounds, along with the consistency and asymptotic normality of their estimators. We also reveal that short-term outcomes, if associated, contribute to improving the estimator of the long-term reward. Based on the proposed estimators, we develop a principled policy learning approach and further derive the convergence rates of regret and estimation errors associated with the learned policy. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its practical applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Jeunen, Aleksei Ustimenko</p>
<p>Abstract: The off-policy paradigm casts recommendation as a counterfactual decision-making task, allowing practitioners to unbiasedly estimate online metrics using offline data. This leads to effective evaluation metrics, as well as learning procedures that directly optimise online success. Nevertheless, the high variance that comes with unbiasedness is typically the crux that complicates practical applications. An important insight is that the difference between policy values can often be estimated with significantly reduced variance, if said policies have positive covariance. This allows us to formulate a pairwise off-policy estimation task: $\Delta\text{-}{\rm OPE}$.
  $\Delta\text{-}{\rm OPE}$ subsumes the common use-case of estimating improvements of a learnt policy over a production policy, using data collected by a stochastic logging policy. We introduce $\Delta\text{-}{\rm OPE}$ methods based on the widely used Inverse Propensity Scoring estimator and its extensions. Moreover, we characterise a variance-optimal additive control variate that further enhances efficiency. Simulated, offline, and online experiments show that our methods significantly improve performance for both evaluation and learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah M. Zyarah, Dhireesha Kudithipudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Pushing the frontiers of time-series information processing in the ever-growing domain of edge devices with stringent resources has been impeded by the systems' ability to process information and learn locally on the device. Local processing and learning of time-series information typically demand intensive computations and massive storage as the process involves retrieving information and tuning hundreds of parameters back in time. In this work, we developed a memristor-based echo state network accelerator that features efficient temporal data processing and in-situ online learning. The proposed design is benchmarked using various datasets involving real-world tasks, such as forecasting the load energy consumption and weather conditions. The experimental results illustrate that the hardware model experiences a marginal degradation in performance as compared to the software counterpart. This is mainly attributed to the limited precision and dynamic range of network parameters when emulated using memristor devices. The proposed system is evaluated for lifespan, robustness, and energy-delay product. It is observed that the system demonstrates reasonable robustness for device failure below 10%, which may occur due to stuck-at faults. Furthermore, 247X reduction in energy consumption is achieved when compared to a custom CMOS digital design implemented at the same technology node.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxian Chen, Hanyang Zhao, Henry Lam, David Yao, Wenpin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the Mallows-DPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with Mallows-DPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, Asef Shahriar, Md Al Amin</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our comparative benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16262">Layer-Aware Analysis of Catastrophic Overfitting: Revealing the Pseudo-Robust Shortcut Dependency</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Runqi Lin, Chaojian Yu, Bo Han, Hang Su, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic overfitting (CO) presents a significant challenge in single-step adversarial training (AT), manifesting as highly distorted deep neural networks (DNNs) that are vulnerable to multi-step adversarial attacks. However, the underlying factors that lead to the distortion of decision boundaries remain unclear. In this work, we delve into the specific changes within different DNN layers and discover that during CO, the former layers are more susceptible, experiencing earlier and greater distortion, while the latter layers show relative insensitivity. Our analysis further reveals that this increased sensitivity in former layers stems from the formation of pseudo-robust shortcuts, which alone can impeccably defend against single-step adversarial attacks but bypass genuine-robust learning, resulting in distorted decision boundaries. Eliminating these shortcuts can partially restore robustness in DNNs from the CO state, thereby verifying that dependence on them triggers the occurrence of CO. This understanding motivates us to implement adaptive weight perturbations across different layers to hinder the generation of pseudo-robust shortcuts, consequently mitigating CO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, Layer-Aware Adversarial Weight Perturbation (LAP), can effectively prevent CO and further enhance robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and deep learning has introduced increasingly complex optimization challenges that must be addressed. Indeed, training modern, advanced models has become difficult to implement without leveraging multiple computing nodes in a distributed environment. Distributed optimization is also fundamental to emerging fields such as federated learning. Specifically, there is a need to organize the training process to minimize the time lost due to communication. A widely used and extensively researched technique to mitigate the communication bottleneck involves performing local training before communication. This approach is the focus of our paper. Concurrently, adaptive methods that incorporate scaling, notably led by Adam, have gained significant popularity in recent years. Therefore, this paper aims to merge the local training technique with the adaptive approach to develop efficient distributed learning methods. We consider the classical Local SGD method and enhance it with a scaling feature. A crucial aspect is that the scaling is described generically, allowing us to analyze various approaches, including Adam, RMSProp, and OASIS, in a unified manner. In addition to theoretical analysis, we validate the performance of our methods in practice by training a neural network.</p>

<p>Abstract: FPGAs have distinct advantages as a technology for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) at the edge. Lookup Table (LUT) based networks, where neurons are directly modeled using LUTs, help maximize this promise of offering ultra-low latency and high area efficiency on FPGAs. Unfortunately, LUT resource usage scales exponentially with the number of inputs to the LUT, restricting PolyLUT to small LUT sizes. This work introduces PolyLUT-Add, a technique that enhances neuron connectivity by combining $A$ PolyLUT sub-neurons via addition to improve accuracy. Moreover, we describe a novel architecture to improve its scalability. We evaluated our implementation over the MNIST, Jet Substructure classification, and Network Intrusion Detection benchmark and found that for similar accuracy, PolyLUT-Add achieves a LUT reduction of $2.0-13.9\times$ with a $1.2-1.6\times$ decrease in latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Weltevrede, Felix Kaubek, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Wendelin B\"ohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the remaining challenges in reinforcement learning is to develop agents that can generalise to novel scenarios they might encounter once deployed. This challenge is often framed in a multi-task setting where agents train on a fixed set of tasks and have to generalise to new tasks. Recent work has shown that in this setting increased exploration during training can be leveraged to increase the generalisation performance of the agent. This makes sense when the states encountered during testing can actually be explored during training. In this paper, we provide intuition why exploration can also benefit generalisation to states that cannot be explicitly encountered during training. Additionally, we propose a novel method Explore-Go that exploits this intuition by increasing the number of states on which the agent trains. Explore-Go effectively increases the starting state distribution of the agent and as a result can be used in conjunction with most existing on-policy or off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. We show empirically that our method can increase generalisation performance in an illustrative environment and on the Procgen benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhrij Patel, Vishnu Sashank Dorbala, Amrit Singh Bedi, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an important problem, which involves an agent exploring the environment to answer user queries. In the existing literature, EQA has exclusively been studied in single-agent scenarios, where exploration can be time-consuming and costly. In this work, we consider EQA in a multi-agent framework involving multiple large language models (LLM) based agents independently answering queries about a household environment. To generate one answer for each query, we use the individual responses to train a Central Answer Model (CAM) that aggregates responses for a robust answer. While prior Question Answering (QA) work has used a central module based on answers from multiple LLM-based experts, we specifically look at applying this framework to embodied LLM-based agents that must physically explore the environment first to become experts on their given environment to answer questions. Our work is the first to utilize a central answer model framework with embodied agents that must rely on exploring an unknown environment. We set up a variation of EQA where instead of the agents exploring the environment after the question is asked, the agents first explore the environment for a set amount of time and then answer a set of queries. Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher EQA accuracy when compared against aggregation methods for ensemble LLM, such as voting schemes and debates. CAM does not require any form of agent communication, alleviating it from the associated costs. We ablate CAM with various nonlinear (neural network, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost) and linear (logistic regression classifier, SVM) algorithms. We experiment in various topological graph environments and examine the case where one of the agents is malicious and purposes contribute responses it believes to be wrong.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haifeng Wen, Hong Xing, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training models on spatio-temporal (ST) data poses an open problem due to the complicated and diverse nature of the data itself, and it is challenging to ensure the model's performance directly trained on the original ST data. While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p>

First, existing network anomaly detection and log analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis. Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data. The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vittorio Giammarino, James Queeney, Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose C-LAIfO, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for imitation learning from videos in the presence of visual mismatch between agent and expert domains. We analyze the problem of imitation from expert videos with visual discrepancies, and introduce a solution for robust latent space estimation using contrastive learning and data augmentation. Provided a visually robust latent space, our algorithm performs imitation entirely within this space using off-policy adversarial imitation learning. We conduct a thorough ablation study to justify our design and test C-LAIfO on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how C-LAIfO can be combined with other reward signals to facilitate learning on a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. Our experiments show improved performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness of C-LAIfO. To ensure reproducibility, we open source our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley Brown, Jordan Juravsky, Ryan Ehrlich, Ronald Clark, Quoc V. Le, Christopher R\'e, Azalia Mirhoseini</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of generated samples. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage - the fraction of problems solved by any attempt - scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43% which uses more capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing, amplifying the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is more cost-effective and solves more issues than paying a premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Finally, we find that identifying correct samples out of many generations remains an important direction for future research in domains without automatic verifiers. When solving math word problems from GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models grows to over 95% with 10,000 samples. However, common methods to pick correct solutions from a sample collection, such as majority voting or reward models, plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohua Feng, Chaochao Chen, Yuyuan Li, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While generative models have made significant advancements in recent years, they also raise concerns such as privacy breaches and biases. Machine unlearning has emerged as a viable solution, aiming to remove specific training data, e.g., containing private information and bias, from models. In this paper, we study the machine unlearning problem in Image-to-Image (I2I) generative models. Previous studies mainly treat it as a single objective optimization problem, offering a solitary solution, thereby neglecting the varied user expectations towards the trade-off between complete unlearning and model utility. To address this issue, we propose a controllable unlearning framework that uses a control coefficient $\varepsilon$ to control the trade-off. We reformulate the I2I generative model unlearning problem into a $\varepsilon$-constrained optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method to find optimal solutions for unlearning boundaries. These boundaries define the valid range for the control coefficient. Within this range, every yielded solution is theoretically guaranteed with Pareto optimality. We also analyze the convergence rate of our framework under various control functions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across three mainstream I2I models demonstrate the effectiveness of our controllable unlearning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Pernigo, Rohan Sen, Davide Baroli</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient energy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy production, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are needed. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic factors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This study explores a non-parametric method based on \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy prediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for the DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional scripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Piunno, Ioannis Stefanou, Cristina Jommi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that combines Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANN) to capture the macroscopic behavior of complex inelastic systems and derive macroelements in geomechanics. The methodology leverages POD to extract macroscopic Internal State Variables (ISVs) from microscopic state information, thereby enriching the macroscopic state description used to train an energy potential network within the TANN framework. The thermodynamic consistency provided by TANN, combined with the hierarchical nature of POD, allows for accurate modeling of complex, non-linear material behavior and reliable macroscopic geomechanical systems responses. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through applications of increasing complexity, demonstrating its capability to handle various material behaviors and microstructural topologies. These applications include the homogenization of continuous inelastic representative unit cells (RUCs) and the derivation of a macroelement for a geotechnical system involving a monopile in a clay layer subjected to horizontal loading. The results indicate that the proposed POD-TANN methodology not only achieves high accuracy in reproducing stress-strain responses, but also significantly reduces computational costs, making it a practical tool for the multiscale modeling of heterogeneous inelastic systems, and the efficient derivation of macroelements for complex geomechanical problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shresth Verma, Niclas Boehmer, Lingkai Kong, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the task of tracking multiple objects in clutter under a distributed multi-sensor network with time-varying connectivity. Designed with the same objective as the centralised variational multi-object tracker, the proposed method achieves optimal decentralised fusion in performance with local processing and communication with only neighboring sensors. A key innovation is the decentralised construction of a locally maximised evidence lower bound, which greatly reduces the information required for communication. Our decentralised natural gradient descent variational multi-object tracker, enhanced with the gradient tracking strategy and natural gradients that adjusts the direction of traditional gradients to the steepest, shows rapid convergence. Our results verify that the proposed method is empirically equivalent to the centralised fusion in tracking accuracy, surpasses suboptimal fusion techniques with comparable costs, and achieves much lower communication overhead than the consensus-based variational multi-object tracker.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have completely transformed the domain of computational pathology (CPath), which in turn altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. FMs overcome the limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath by learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language to be used as a rich semantic information source to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and the way it is going to be transformed through FMs and VLMs in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: The design of aerodynamic shapes, such as airfoils, has traditionally required significant computational resources and relied on predefined design parameters, which limit the potential for novel shape synthesis. In this work, we introduce a data-driven methodology for airfoil generation using a diffusion model. Trained on a dataset of preexisting airfoils, our model can generate an arbitrary number of new airfoils from random vectors, which can be conditioned on specific aerodynamic performance metrics such as lift and drag, or geometric criteria. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively produces airfoil shapes with realistic aerodynamic properties, offering substantial improvements in efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for discovering innovative airfoil designs. This approach significantly expands the design space, facilitating the synthesis of high-performance aerodynamic shapes that transcend the limitations of traditional methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: How do language models use information provided as context when generating a response? Can we infer whether a particular generated statement is actually grounded in the context, a misinterpretation, or fabricated? To help answer these questions, we introduce the problem of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context (if any) that led a model to generate a particular statement. We then present ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution that can be applied on top of any existing language model. Finally, we showcase the utility of ContextCite through three applications: (1) helping verify generated statements (2) improving response quality by pruning the context and (3) detecting poisoning attacks. We provide code for ContextCite at https://github.com/MadryLab/context-cite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shion Takeno, Yu Inatsu, Masayuki Karasuyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically established algorithm for Bayesian optimization (BO), where we assume the objective function $f$ follows GP. One notable drawback of GP-UCB is that the theoretical confidence parameter $\beta$ increased along with the iterations is too large. To alleviate this drawback, this paper analyzes the randomized variant of GP-UCB called improved randomized GP-UCB (IRGP-UCB), which uses the confidence parameter generated from the shifted exponential distribution. We analyze the expected regret and conditional expected regret, where the expectation and the probability are taken respectively with $f$ and noises and with the randomness of the BO algorithm. In both regret analyses, IRGP-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret upper bound without increasing the confidence parameter if the input domain is finite. Finally, we show numerical experiments using synthetic and benchmark functions and real-world emulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gao Tianci, Dmitriev D. Dmitry, Konstantin A. Neusypin, Yang Bo, Rao Shengren</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have been fueled by large-scale data and deep neural networks, particularly for high-dimensional and complex tasks. Online RL methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are effective in dynamic scenarios but require substantial real-time data, posing challenges in resource-constrained or slow simulation environments. Offline RL addresses this by pre-learning policies from large datasets, though its success depends on the quality and diversity of the data. This work proposes a framework that enhances PPO algorithms by incorporating a diffusion model to generate high-quality virtual trajectories for offline datasets. This approach improves exploration and sample efficiency, leading to significant gains in cumulative rewards, convergence speed, and strategy stability in complex tasks. Our contributions are threefold: we explore the potential of diffusion models in RL, particularly for offline datasets, extend the application of online RL to offline environments, and experimentally validate the performance improvements of PPO with diffusion models. These findings provide new insights and methods for applying RL to high-dimensional, complex tasks. Finally, we open-source our code at https://github.com/TianciGao/DiffPPO</p>

<p>Abstract: In classification tasks, achieving a harmonious balance between exploration and precision is of paramount importance. To this end, this research introduces two novel deep learning models, SleepNet and DreamNet, to strike this balance. SleepNet seamlessly integrates supervised learning with unsupervised ``sleep" stages using pre-trained encoder models. Dedicated neurons within SleepNet are embedded in these unsupervised features, forming intermittent ``sleep" blocks that facilitate exploratory learning. Building upon the foundation of SleepNet, DreamNet employs full encoder-decoder frameworks to reconstruct the hidden states, mimicking the human "dreaming" process. This reconstruction process enables further exploration and refinement of the learned representations. Moreover, the principle ideas of our SleepNet and DreamNet are generic and can be applied to both computer vision and natural language processing downstream tasks. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse image and text datasets, SleepNet and DreanNet have demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, showcasing the strengths of unsupervised exploration and supervised precision afforded by our innovative approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangyang Luo, Shuai Wang, Xiang Li, Yunshi Lan, Ming Gao, Jinlong Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity as a distributed learning framework that only shares model parameters or gradient updates and keeps private data locally. However, FL is at risk of privacy leakage caused by privacy inference attacks. And most existing privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL conflict with achieving high performance and efficiency. Therefore, we propose FedMD-CG, a novel FL method with highly competitive performance and high-level privacy preservation, which decouples each client's local model into a feature extractor and a classifier, and utilizes a conditional generator instead of the feature extractor to perform server-side model aggregation. To ensure the consistency of local generators and classifiers, FedMD-CG leverages knowledge distillation to train local models and generators at both the latent feature level and the logit level. Also, we construct additional classification losses and design new diversity losses to enhance client-side training. FedMD-CG is robust to data heterogeneity and does not require training extra discriminators (like cGAN). We conduct extensive experiments on various image classification tasks to validate the superiority of FedMD-CG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning regularization techniques, such as dropout, layer normalization, or weight decay, are widely adopted in the construction of modern artificial neural networks, often resulting in more robust training processes and improved generalization capabilities. However, in the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the application of these techniques has been limited, usually applied to value function estimators, and may result in detrimental effects. This issue is even more pronounced in offline RL settings, which bear greater similarity to supervised learning but have received less attention. Recent work in continuous offline RL has demonstrated that while we can build sufficiently powerful critic networks, the generalization of actor networks remains a bottleneck. In this study, we empirically show that applying standard regularization techniques to actor networks in offline RL actor-critic algorithms yields improvements of 6% on average across two algorithms and three different continuous D4RL domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakeel A. Sheikh, Yacouba Kaloga, Md Sahidullah, Ina Kodrasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the promising performance of state of the art approaches for Parkinsons Disease (PD) detection, these approaches often analyze individual speech segments in isolation, which can lead to suboptimal results. Dysarthric cues that characterize speech impairments from PD patients are expected to be related across segments from different speakers. Isolated segment analysis fails to exploit these inter segment relationships. Additionally, not all speech segments from PD patients exhibit clear dysarthric symptoms, introducing label noise that can negatively affect the performance and generalizability of current approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel PD detection framework utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By representing speech segments as nodes and capturing the similarity between segments through edges, our GCN model facilitates the aggregation of dysarthric cues across the graph, effectively exploiting segment relationships and mitigating the impact of label noise. Experimental results demonstrate theadvantages of the proposed GCN model for PD detection and provide insights into its underlying mechanisms</p>

<p>Abstract: The K-sample testing problem involves determining whether K groups of data points are each drawn from the same distribution. Analysis of variance is arguably the most classical method to test mean differences, along with several recent methods to test distributional differences.

Consequently, universally consistent K-sample testing can be achieved using a universally consistent dependence measure, such as distance correlation and the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. This enables a wide range of dependence measures to be easily applied to K-sample testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Mengyuan Liu, Hong Liu, Tianyu Guo, Ti Wang, Hao Tang, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models have shown competitive results in learning visual representations without self-attention. However, existing MLP models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of human body configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific demand of the 3D human pose, while allowing for both local and global spatial interactions. Furthermore, we propose to flexibly and efficiently extend the GraphMLP to the video domain and show that complex temporal dynamics can be effectively modeled in a simple way with negligible computational cost gains in the sequence length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MLP-Like architecture for 3D human pose estimation in a single frame and a video sequence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> No\'emie Jaquier, Leonel Rozo, Miguel Gonz\'alez-Duque, Viacheslav Borovitskiy, Tamim Asfour</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion taxonomies serve as high-level hierarchical abstractions that classify how humans move and interact with their environment. They have proven useful to analyse grasps, manipulation skills, and whole-body support poses. Despite substantial efforts devoted to design their hierarchy and underlying categories, their use remains limited. This may be attributed to the lack of computational models that fill the gap between the discrete hierarchical structure of the taxonomy and the high-dimensional heterogeneous data associated to its categories. To overcome this problem, we propose to model taxonomy data via hyperbolic embeddings that capture the associated hierarchical structure. We achieve this by formulating a novel Gaussian process hyperbolic latent variable model that incorporates the taxonomy structure through graph-based priors on the latent space and distance-preserving back constraints. We validate our model on three different human motion taxonomies to learn hyperbolic embeddings that faithfully preserve the original graph structure. We show that our model properly encodes unseen data from existing or new taxonomy categories, and outperforms its Euclidean and VAE-based counterparts. Finally, through proof-of-concept experiments, we show that our model may be used to generate realistic trajectories between the learned embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \c{C}a\u{g}kan Yapar, Ron Levie, Gitta Kutyniok, Giuseppe Caire</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we present a collection of radio map datasets in dense urban setting, which we generated and made publicly available. The datasets include simulated pathloss/received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (ToA) radio maps over a large collection of realistic dense urban setting in real city maps. The two main applications of the presented dataset are 1) learning methods that predict the pathloss from input city maps (namely, deep learning-based simulations), and, 2) wireless localization. The fact that the RSS and ToA maps are computed by the same simulations over the same city maps allows for a fair comparison of the RSS and ToA-based localization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Zhang, Daniel Tabas, Baosen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the scenario-based two-stage stochastic DC optimal power flow (OPF) problem for optimal and reliable dispatch when the load is facing uncertainty. Although this problem is a linear program, it remains computationally challenging to solve due to the large number of scenarios needed to accurately represent the uncertainties. To mitigate the computational issues, many techniques have been proposed to approximate the second-stage decisions so they can be dealt more efficiently. The challenge of finding good policies to approximate the second-stage decisions is that these solutions need to be feasible, which has been difficult to achieve with existing policies.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a learning method to solve the two-stage problem in a more efficient and optimal way. A technique called the gauge map is incorporated into the learning architecture design to guarantee the learned solutions' feasibility to the network constraints. Namely, we can design policies that are feed forward functions and only output feasible solutions. Simulation results on standard IEEE systems show that, compared to iterative solvers and the widely used affine policy, our proposed method not only learns solutions of good quality but also accelerates the computation by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandr Beznosikov, David Dobre, Gauthier Gidel</p>
<p>Abstract: The Frank-Wolfe (FW) method is a popular approach for solving optimization problems with structured constraints that arise in machine learning applications. In recent years, stochastic versions of FW have gained popularity, motivated by large datasets for which the computation of the full gradient is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present two new variants of the FW algorithms for stochastic finite-sum minimization. Our algorithms have the best convergence guarantees of existing stochastic FW approaches for both convex and non-convex objective functions. Our methods do not have the issue of permanently collecting large batches, which is common to many stochastic projection-free approaches. Moreover, our second approach does not require either large batches or full deterministic gradients, which is a typical weakness of many techniques for finite-sum problems. The faster theoretical rates of our approaches are confirmed experimentally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fateme Abbasi, Sandip Banerjee, Jaros{\l}aw Byrka, Parinya Chalermsook, Ameet Gadekar, Kamyar Khodamoradi, D\'aniel Marx, Roohani Sharma, Joachim Spoerhase</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the well-studied Robust $(k, z)$-Clustering problem, which generalizes the classic $k$-Median, $k$-Means, and $k$-Center problems. Given a constant $z\ge 1$, the input to Robust $(k, z)$-Clustering is a set $P$ of $n$ weighted points in a metric space $(M,\delta)$ and a positive integer $k$. Further, each point belongs to one (or more) of the $m$ many different groups $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_m$. Our goal is to find a set $X$ of $k$ centers such that $\max_{i \in [m]} \sum_{p \in S_i} w(p) \delta(p,X)^z$ is minimized.
  This problem arises in the domains of robust optimization [Anthony, Goyal, Gupta, Nagarajan, Math. Oper. Res. 2010] and in algorithmic fairness. For polynomial time computation, an approximation factor of $O(\log m/\log\log m)$ is known [Makarychev, Vakilian, COLT $2021$], which is tight under a plausible complexity assumption even in the line metrics. For FPT time, there is a $(3^z+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which is tight under GAP-ETH [Goyal, Jaiswal, Inf. Proc. Letters, 2023].
  Motivated by the tight lower bounds for general discrete metrics, we focus on \emph{geometric} spaces such as the (discrete) high-dimensional Euclidean setting and metrics of low doubling dimension, which play an important role in data analysis applications. First, for a universal constant $\eta_0 >0.0006$, we devise a $3^z(1-\eta_{0})$-factor FPT approximation algorithm for discrete high-dimensional Euclidean spaces thereby bypassing the lower bound for general metrics. We complement this result by showing that even the special case of $k$-Center in dimension $\Theta(\log n)$ is $(\sqrt{3/2}- o(1))$-hard to approximate for FPT algorithms. Finally, we complete the FPT approximation landscape by designing an FPT $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation scheme (EPAS) for the metric of sub-logarithmic doubling dimension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Luxenberg, Dhruv Malik, Yuanzhi Li, Aarti Singh, Stephen Boyd</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider robust empirical risk minimization (ERM), where model parameters are chosen to minimize the worst-case empirical loss when each data point varies over a given convex uncertainty set. In some simple cases, such problems can be expressed in an analytical form. In general the problem can be made tractable via dualization, which turns a min-max problem into a min-min problem. Dualization requires expertise and is tedious and error-prone. We demonstrate how CVXPY can be used to automate this dualization procedure in a user-friendly manner. Our framework allows practitioners to specify and solve robust ERM problems with a general class of convex losses, capturing many standard regression and classification problems. Users can easily specify any complex uncertainty set that is representable via disciplined convex programming (DCP) constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyang Wang, Manya Ghobadi, Kayvon Shakeri, Ying Zhang, Naader Hasani</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a low-cost network architecture for training large language models (LLMs) at hyperscale. We study the optimal parallelization strategy of LLMs and propose a novel datacenter network design tailored to LLM's unique communication pattern. We show that LLM training generates sparse communication patterns in the network and, therefore, does not require any-to-any full-bisection network to complete efficiently. As a result, our design eliminates the spine layer in traditional GPU clusters. We name this design a Rail-only network and demonstrate that it achieves the same training performance while reducing the network cost by 38% to 77% and network power consumption by 37% to 75% compared to a conventional GPU datacenter. Our architecture also supports Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models with all-to-all communication through forwarding, with only 8.2% to 11.2% completion time overhead for all-to-all traffic. We study the failure robustness of Rail-only networks and provide insights into the performance impact of different network and training parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thi Minh Anh Pham, An Duc Nguyen, Cephas Svosve, Vasileios Argyriou, Georgios Tzimiropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated great potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes. Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of 5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Xing, Qijun Feng, Haoran Chen, Qi Dai, Han Hu, Hang Xu, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent wave of AI-generated content (AIGC) has witnessed substantial success in computer vision, with the diffusion model playing a crucial role in this achievement. Due to their impressive generative capabilities, diffusion models are gradually superseding methods based on GANs and auto-regressive Transformers, demonstrating exceptional performance not only in image generation and editing, but also in the realm of video-related research. However, existing surveys mainly focus on diffusion models in the context of image generation, with few up-to-date reviews on their application in the video domain. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video diffusion models in the AIGC era. Specifically, we begin with a concise introduction to the fundamentals and evolution of diffusion models. Subsequently, we present an overview of research on diffusion models in the video domain, categorizing the work into three key areas: video generation, video editing, and other video understanding tasks. We conduct a thorough review of the literature in these three key areas, including further categorization and practical contributions in the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by research in this domain and outline potential future developmental trends. A comprehensive list of video diffusion models studied in this survey is available at https://github.com/ChenHsing/Awesome-Video-Diffusion-Models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adapting a language model into a specific domain, a.k.a `domain adaption', is a common practice when specialized knowledge, e.g. medicine, is not encapsulated in a general language model like Llama2. The challenge lies in the heterogeneity of data across the two training stages, as it varies in languages, genres, or formats. To tackle this and simplify the learning protocol, we propose to transform heterogeneous data, from the both pre-training and supervised stages, into a unified, simple input-output pair format. We validate the new protocol in the domains where proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT perform relatively poorly, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine. The developed model, HuatuoGPT-II, has shown state-of-the-art performance in Chinese medicine domain on a number of benchmarks, e.g. medical licensing exams. It even outperforms proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in some aspects, especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Expert manual evaluations further validate HuatuoGPT-II's advantages over existing LLMs. Notably, HuatuoGPT-II was benchmarked in a fresh Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination where it achieved the best performance, showcasing not only its effectiveness but also its generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Miao, Xinran Miao, Yixuan Wu, Jiwei Zhao, Qiongshi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: A primary challenge facing modern scientific research is the limited availability of gold-standard data which can be costly, labor-intensive, or invasive to obtain. With the rapid development of machine learning (ML), scientists can now employ ML algorithms to predict gold-standard outcomes with variables that are easier to obtain. However, these predicted outcomes are often used directly in subsequent statistical analyses, ignoring imprecision and heterogeneity introduced by the prediction procedure. This will likely result in false positive findings and invalid scientific conclusions. In this work, we introduce PoSt-Prediction Adaptive inference (PSPA) that allows valid and powerful inference based on ML-predicted data. Its "assumption-lean" property guarantees reliable statistical inference without assumptions on the ML prediction. Its "data-adaptive" feature guarantees an efficiency gain over existing methods, regardless of the accuracy of ML prediction. We demonstrate the statistical superiority and broad applicability of our method through simulations and real-data applications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16341">Harnessing the Power of Federated Learning in Federated Contextual Bandits</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengshuai Shi, Ruida Zhou, Kun Yang, Cong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has demonstrated great potential in revolutionizing distributed machine learning, and tremendous efforts have been made to extend it beyond the original focus on supervised learning. Among many directions, federated contextual bandits (FCB), a pivotal integration of FL and sequential decision-making, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress, existing FCB approaches have largely employed their tailored FL components, often deviating from the canonical FL framework. Consequently, even renowned algorithms like FedAvg remain under-utilized in FCB, let alone other FL advancements. Motivated by this disconnection, this work takes one step towards building a tighter relationship between the canonical FL study and the investigations on FCB. In particular, a novel FCB design, termed FedIGW, is proposed to leverage a regression-based CB algorithm, i.e., inverse gap weighting. Compared with existing FCB approaches, the proposed FedIGW design can better harness the entire spectrum of FL innovations, which is concretely reflected as (1) flexible incorporation of (both existing and forthcoming) FL protocols; (2) modularized plug-in of FL analyses in performance guarantees; (3) seamless integration of FL appendages (such as personalization, robustness, and privacy). We substantiate these claims through rigorous theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaitlyn Wang, Jian Ge, Kevin Willis, Kevin Wang, Yinan Zhao, Quanquan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Of over 5,000 exoplanets identified so far, only a few hundred possess sub-Earth radii. The formation processes of these sub-Earths remain elusive, and acquiring additional samples is essential for investigating this unique population. In our study, we employ the GPFC method, a novel GPU Phase Folding algorithm combined with a Convolutional Neural Network, on Kepler photometry data. This method enhances the transit search speed significantly over the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares method, allowing a complete search of the known Kepler KOI data within days using a commercial GPU card. To date, we have identified five new ultra-short-period planets (USPs): Kepler-158d, Kepler-963c, Kepler-879c, Kepler-1489c, and KOI-4978.02. Kepler-879c with a radius of $0.4 R_\oplus$ completes its orbit around a G dwarf in 0.646716 days. Kepler-158d with a radius of $0.43 R_\oplus$ orbits a K dwarf star every 0.645088 days. Kepler-1489c with a radius of $0.51 R_\oplus$ orbits a G dwarf in 0.680741 days. Kepler-963c with a radius of $0.6 R_\oplus$ revolves around a G dwarf in 0.919783 days, and KOI-4978.02 with a radius of $0.7 R_\oplus$ circles a G dwarf in 0.941967 days. Among our findings, Kepler-879c, Kepler-158d and Kepler-963c rank as the first, the third, the fourth smallest USPs identified to date. Notably, Kepler-158d stands as the smallest USP found orbiting K dwarfs while Kepler-963c, Kepler-879c, Kepler-1489c, and KOI-4978.02 are the smallest USPs found orbiting G dwarfs. Kepler-879c, Kepler-158d, Kepler-1489c, and KOI-4978.02 are among the smallest planets that are closest to their host stars, with orbits within 5 stellar radii. In addition, these discoveries highlight GPFC's promising capability in identifying small, new transiting exoplanets within photometry data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming space transit missions, PLATO and ET.</p>

The algorithm is universal in the sense that it is independent of the dimension and that it does not require any assumptions on the given characteristic function. Furthermore, finite sample guarantees on the approximation quality in terms of the Maximum-Mean Discrepancy metric are derived. The method is illustrated in a simulation study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namjoon Suh, Guang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we review the literature on statistical theories of neural networks from three perspectives: approximation, training dynamics and generative models. In the first part, results on excess risks for neural networks are reviewed in the nonparametric framework of regression (and classification in Appendix~{\color{blue}B}). These results rely on explicit constructions of neural networks, leading to fast convergence rates of excess risks. Nonetheless, their underlying analysis only applies to the global minimizer in the highly non-convex landscape of deep neural networks. This motivates us to review the training dynamics of neural networks in the second part. Specifically, we review papers that attempt to answer ``how the neural network trained via gradient-based methods finds the solution that can generalize well on unseen data.'' In particular, two well-known paradigms are reviewed: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and Mean-Field (MF) paradigm. Last but not least, we review the most recent theoretical advancements in generative models including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and in-context learning (ICL) in the Large Language Models (LLMs) from two perpsectives reviewed previously, i.e., approximation and training dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip \'Uradn\'ik, David Sychrovsk\'y, Jakub \v{C}ern\'y, Martin \v{C}ern\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative game theory has diverse applications in contemporary artificial intelligence, including domains like interpretable machine learning, resource allocation, and collaborative decision-making. However, specifying a cooperative game entails assigning values to exponentially many coalitions, and obtaining even a single value can be resource-intensive in practice. Yet simply leaving certain coalition values undisclosed introduces ambiguity regarding individual contributions to the collective grand coalition. This ambiguity often leads to players holding overly optimistic expectations, stemming from either inherent biases or strategic considerations, frequently resulting in collective claims exceeding the actual grand coalition value. In this paper, we present a framework aimed at optimizing the sequence for revealing coalition values, with the overarching goal of efficiently closing the gap between players' expectations and achievable outcomes in cooperative games. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we study the individual players' optimistic completions of games with missing coalition values along with the arising gap, and investigate its analytical characteristics that facilitate more efficient optimization; (ii) we develop methods to minimize this gap over classes of games with a known prior by disclosing values of additional coalitions in both offline and online fashion; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate the algorithms' performance in practical scenarios, together with an investigation into the typical order of revealing coalition values.</p>

<p>Abstract: The healthcare landscape is evolving, with patients seeking reliable information about their health conditions and available treatment options. Despite the abundance of information sources, the digital age overwhelms individuals with excess, often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust medical professionals, highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health information. However, increased patient loads on experts has led to reduced communication time, impacting information sharing. To address this gap, we develop CataractBot, an experts-in-the-loop chatbot powered by LLMs, in collaboration with an eye hospital in India. CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions instantly by querying a curated knowledge base, and provides expert-verified responses asynchronously. It has multimodal and multilingual capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 55 participants, CataractBot proved valuable, providing anytime accessibility, saving time, accommodating diverse literacy levels, alleviating power differences, and adding a privacy layer between patients and doctors. Users reported that their trust in the system was established through expert verification. Broadly, our results could inform future work on designing expert-mediated LLM bots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qibing Ren, Chang Gao, Jing Shao, Junchi Yan, Xin Tan, Wai Lam, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable generative capabilities but also raised concerns about their potential misuse. While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a new and universal safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80\% of the time. We find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures. Furthermore, we give our hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk. Finally, we analyze potential mitigation measures. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fadillah Adamsyah Maani, Numan Saeed, Aleksandr Matsun, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models have been advancing automatic medical image analysis on various modalities, including echocardiography, by offering a comprehensive end-to-end training pipeline. This approach enables DL models to regress ejection fraction (EF) directly from 2D+time echocardiograms, resulting in superior performance. However, the end-to-end training pipeline makes the learned representations less explainable. The representations may also fail to capture the continuous relation among echocardiogram clips, indicating the existence of spurious correlations, which can negatively affect the generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose CoReEcho, a novel training framework emphasizing continuous representations tailored for direct EF regression. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoReEcho: 1) outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the largest echocardiography dataset (EchoNet-Dynamic) with MAE of 3.90 & R2 of 82.44, and 2) provides robust and generalizable features that transfer more effectively in related downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Vilas Samak, Tanmay Vilas Samak, Venkat Krovi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems usually require significantly long training times due to their inherent complexity. Furthermore, deploying them in the real world demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple embodied agents, which may not be feasible due to budget or space limitations, not to mention energy consumption and safety issues. This work tries to address these pain points by presenting a sustainable digital twin framework capable of accelerating MARL training by selectively scaling parallelized workloads on-demand, and transferring the trained policies from simulation to reality using minimal hardware resources. The applicability of the proposed digital twin framework is highlighted through two representative use cases, which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We study the effect of agent and environment parallelization on training time and that of systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer across both the case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training time with the proposed parallelization scheme and as low as 2.9% sim2real gap using the suggested deployment method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinab Bhattacharjee, Andrey A. Popov, Arash Sarshar, Adrian Sandu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Adam optimizer, often used in Machine Learning for neural network training, corresponds to an underlying ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the limit of very small learning rates. This work shows that the classical Adam algorithm is a first-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Euler discretization of the underlying ODE. Employing the time discretization point of view, we propose new extensions of the Adam scheme obtained by using higher-order IMEX methods to solve the ODE. Based on this approach, we derive a new optimization algorithm for neural network training that performs better than classical Adam on several regression and classification problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Kuipers, Renukanandan Tumu, Shuo Yang, Milad Kazemi, Rahul Mangharam, Nicola Paoletti</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-Policy Prediction (OPP), i.e., predicting the outcomes of a target policy using only data collected under a nominal (behavioural) policy, is a paramount problem in data-driven analysis of safety-critical systems where the deployment of a new policy may be unsafe. To achieve dependable off-policy predictions, recent work on Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP) leverage the conformal prediction framework to derive prediction regions with probabilistic guarantees under the target process. Existing COPP methods can account for the distribution shifts induced by policy switching, but are limited to single-agent systems and scalar outcomes (e.g., rewards). In this work, we introduce MA-COPP, the first conformal prediction method to solve OPP problems involving multi-agent systems, deriving joint prediction regions for all agents' trajectories when one or more ego agents change their policies. Unlike the single-agent scenario, this setting introduces higher complexity as the distribution shifts affect predictions for all agents, not just the ego agents, and the prediction task involves full multi-dimensional trajectories, not just reward values. A key contribution of MA-COPP is to avoid enumeration or exhaustive search of the output space of agent trajectories, which is instead required by existing COPP methods to construct the prediction region. We achieve this by showing that an over-approximation of the true joint prediction region (JPR) can be constructed, without enumeration, from the maximum density ratio of the JPR trajectories. We evaluate the effectiveness of MA-COPP in multi-agent systems from the PettingZoo library and the F1TENTH autonomous racing environment, achieving nominal coverage in higher dimensions and various shift settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the dynamic construction industry, traditional robotic integration has primarily focused on automating specific tasks, often overlooking the complexity and variability of human aspects in construction workflows. This paper introduces a human-centered approach with a "work companion rover" designed to assist construction workers within their existing practices, aiming to enhance safety and workflow fluency while respecting construction labor's skilled nature. We conduct an in-depth study on deploying a robotic system in carpentry formwork, showcasing a prototype that emphasizes mobility, safety, and comfortable worker-robot collaboration in dynamic environments through a contextual Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven modular framework. Our research advances robotic applications in construction, advocating for collaborative models where adaptive robots support rather than replace humans, underscoring the potential for an interactive and collaborative human-robot workforce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoyu Wang, Yitian Tao, Qing Yang, Yan Liang, Siwei Liu, Hongcheng Shi, Dinggang Shen, Han Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous functional PET/MR (sf-PET/MR) presents a cutting-edge multimodal neuroimaging technique. It provides an unprecedented opportunity for concurrently monitoring and integrating multifaceted brain networks built by spatiotemporally covaried metabolic activity, neural activity, and cerebral blood flow (perfusion). Albeit high scientific/clinical values, short in hardware accessibility of PET/MR hinders its applications, let alone modern AI-based PET/MR fusion models. Our objective is to develop a clinically feasible AI-based disease diagnosis model trained on comprehensive sf-PET/MR data with the power of, during inferencing, allowing single modality input (e.g., PET only) as well as enforcing multimodal-based accuracy. To this end, we propose MX-ARM, a multimodal MiXture-of-experts Alignment and Reconstruction Model. It is modality detachable and exchangeable, allocating different multi-layer perceptrons dynamically ("mixture of experts") through learnable weights to learn respective representations from different modalities. Such design will not sacrifice model performance in uni-modal situation. To fully exploit the inherent complex and nonlinear relation among modalities while producing fine-grained representations for uni-modal inference, we subsequently add a modal alignment module to line up a dominant modality (e.g., PET) with representations of auxiliary modalities (MR). We further adopt multimodal reconstruction to promote the quality of learned features. Experiments on precious multimodal sf-PET/MR data for Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis showcase the efficacy of our model toward clinically feasible precision medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmeng Huang, Shuo Li, Mengxin Yu, Matteo Sesia, Hamed Hassani, Insup Lee, Osbert Bastani, Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have shown promising performance in natural language generation. However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses, it is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given inputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many uncertainty measures ($e.g.$, semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based measures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed $Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The broad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are demonstrated empirically.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging results by converting statistic maps across different functional MRI pipelines. We make the assumption that pipelines used to compute fMRI statistic maps can be considered as a style component and we propose to use different generative models, among which, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Diffusion Models (DM) to convert statistic maps across different pipelines. We explore the performance of multiple GAN frameworks, and design a new DM framework for unsupervised multi-domain styletransfer. We constrain the generation of 3D fMRI statistic maps using the latent space of an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes statistic maps from different pipelines and extend traditional sampling techniques used in DM to improve the transition performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods aresuccessful: pipelines can indeed be transferred as a style component, providing animportant source of data augmentation for future medical studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Barone, Aashrit Cunchala, Rudy Nunez</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard classification theory assumes that the distribution of images in the test and training sets are identical. Unfortunately, real-life scenarios typically feature unseen data (''out-of-distribution data") which is different from data in the training distribution(''in-distribution"). This issue is most prevalent in social justice problems where data from under-represented groups may appear in the test data without representing an equal proportion of the training data. This may result in a model returning confidently wrong decisions and predictions. We are interested in the following question: Can the performance of a neural network improve on facial images of out-of-distribution data when it is trained simultaneously on multiple datasets of in-distribution data? We approach this problem by incorporating the Outlier Exposure model and investigate how the model's performance changes when other datasets of facial images were implemented. We observe that the accuracy and other metrics of the model can be increased by applying Outlier Exposure, incorporating a trainable weight parameter to increase the machine's emphasis on outlier images, and by re-weighting the importance of different class labels. We also experimented with whether sorting the images and determining outliers via image features would have more of an effect on the metrics than sorting by average pixel value, and found no conclusive results. Our goal was to make models not only more accurate but also more fair by scanning a more expanded range of images. We also tested the datasets in reverse order to see whether a more fair dataset with balanced features has an effect on the model's accuracy. Utilizing Python and the Pytorch package, we found that models that utilizing outlier exposure could make models more fair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of machine-learning solutions to movement assessment from skeleton videos has attracted significant research attention in recent years. This advancement has made rehabilitation at home more accessible, utilizing movement assessment algorithms that can operate on affordable equipment for human pose detection and analysis from 2D or 3D videos. While the primary objective of automatic assessment tasks is to score movements, the automatic generation of feedback highlighting key movement issues has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate the rehabilitation process. While numerous research works exist in the field of automatic movement assessment, only a handful address feedback generation. In this study, we propose terminology and criteria for the classification, evaluation, and comparison of feedback generation solutions. We discuss the challenges associated with each feedback generation approach and use our proposed criteria to classify existing solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that formulates feedback generation in skeletal movement assessment.</p>

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator based on Koopman operator theory to extract meaningful finite-dimensional representations of complex non-linear systems. The Koopman model is used together with deep reinforcement networks that learn the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of nonlinear systems. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the estimated nonlinear system, which enables it to compute optimal state estimates without re-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohanad Odema, Luke Chen, Hyoukjun Kwon, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging multi-model workloads with heavy models like recent large language models significantly increased the compute and memory demands on hardware. To address such increasing demands, designing a scalable hardware architecture became a key problem. Among recent solutions, the 2.5D silicon interposer multi-chip module (MCM)-based AI accelerator has been actively explored as a promising scalable solution due to their significant benefits in the low engineering cost and composability. However, previous MCM accelerators are based on homogeneous architectures with fixed dataflow, which encounter major challenges from highly heterogeneous multi-model workloads due to their limited workload adaptivity. Therefore, in this work, we explore the opportunity in the heterogeneous dataflow MCM AI accelerators. We identify the scheduling of multi-model workload on heterogeneous dataflow MCM AI accelerator is an important and challenging problem due to its significance and scale, which reaches O(10^56) even for a two-model workload on 6x6 chiplets. We develop a set of heuristics to navigate the huge scheduling space and codify them into a scheduler, SCAR, with advanced techniques such as inter-chiplet pipelining. Our evaluation on ten multi-model workload scenarios for datacenter multitenancy and AR/VR use-cases has shown the efficacy of our approach, achieving on average 27.6% and 29.6% less energy-delay product (EDP) for the respective applications settings compared to homogeneous baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Jeunen, Jatin Mandav, Ivan Potapov, Nakul Agarwal, Sourabh Vaid, Wenzhe Shi, Aleksei Ustimenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world recommender systems often need to balance multiple objectives when deciding which recommendations to present to users. These include behavioural signals (e.g. clicks, shares, dwell time), as well as broader objectives (e.g. diversity, fairness). Scalarisation methods are commonly used to handle this balancing task, where a weighted average of per-objective reward signals determines the final score used for ranking. Naturally, how these weights are computed exactly, is key to success for any online platform. We frame this as a decision-making task, where the scalarisation weights are actions taken to maximise an overall North Star reward (e.g. long-term user retention or growth). We extend existing policy learning methods to the continuous multivariate action domain, proposing to maximise a pessimistic lower bound on the North Star reward that the learnt policy will yield. Typical lower bounds based on normal approximations suffer from insufficient coverage, and we propose an efficient and effective policy-dependent correction for this. We provide guidance to design stochastic data collection policies, as well as highly sensitive reward signals. Empirical observations from simulations, offline and online experiments highlight the efficacy of our deployed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable attention recently due to their outstanding comprehension and reasoning capabilities, leading to great progress in many fields. The advancement of LLM techniques also offers promising opportunities to automate many tasks in the telecommunication (telecom) field. After pre-training and fine-tuning, LLMs can perform diverse downstream tasks based on human instructions, paving the way to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled 6G. Given the great potential of LLM technologies, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-enabled telecom networks. In particular, we first present LLM fundamentals, including model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, model evaluation, and telecom deployment. Then, we introduce LLM-enabled key techniques and telecom applications in terms of generation, classification, optimization, and prediction problems. Specifically, the LLM-enabled generation applications include telecom domain knowledge, code, and network configuration generation. After that, the LLM-based classification applications involve network security, text, image, and traffic classification problems. Moreover, multiple LLM-enabled optimization techniques are introduced, such as automated reward function design for reinforcement learning and verbal reinforcement learning. Furthermore, for LLM-aided prediction problems, we discussed time-series prediction models and multi-modality prediction problems for telecom. Finally, we highlight the challenges and identify the future directions of LLM-enabled telecom networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing safety concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, common Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a dualization perspective that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, thus greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based scenarios (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Tian He, Junfeng Fu, Ling Wang, Jingcai Guo, Ting Hu, Hong Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action representation learning aims to interpret and understand human behaviors by encoding the skeleton sequences, which can be categorized into two primary training paradigms: supervised learning and self-supervised learning. However, the former one-hot classification requires labor-intensive predefined action categories annotations, while the latter involves skeleton transformations (e.g., cropping) in the pretext tasks that may impair the skeleton structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel skeleton-based training framework (C$^2$VL) based on Cross-modal Contrastive learning that uses the progressive distillation to learn task-agnostic human skeleton action representation from the Vision-Language knowledge prompts. Specifically, we establish the vision-language action concept space through vision-language knowledge prompts generated by pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), which enrich the fine-grained details that the skeleton action space lacks. Moreover, we propose the intra-modal self-similarity and inter-modal cross-consistency softened targets in the cross-modal representation learning process to progressively control and guide the degree of pulling vision-language knowledge prompts and corresponding skeletons closer. These soft instance discrimination and self-knowledge distillation strategies contribute to the learning of better skeleton-based action representations from the noisy skeleton-vision-language pairs. During the inference phase, our method requires only the skeleton data as the input for action recognition and no longer for vision-language prompts. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have shown promising results in Speaker Verification (SV). However, narrowing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Several studies have observed that speech representations from large-scale ASR models contain valuable speaker information. This work explores the limitations of fine-tuning these models for SV using an SSL contrastive objective in an end-to-end approach. Then, we propose a framework to learn speaker representations in an SSL context by fine-tuning a pre-trained WavLM with a supervised loss using pseudo-labels. Initial pseudo-labels are derived from an SSL DINO-based model and are iteratively refined by clustering the model embeddings. Our method achieves 0.99% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, establishing the new state-of-the-art on self-supervised SV. As this performance is close to our supervised baseline of 0.94% EER, this contribution is a step towards supervised performance on SV with SSL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B\'alint M\'at\'e, Fran\c{c}ois Fleuret, Tristan Bereau</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a score matching objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI reproduces the underlying changes in free energy without the need for simulations at interpolating Hamiltonians.</p>

Our study explores new methods to alleviate the performance degradation of SER algorithms and develop a more robust system for adverse conditions. We propose processing multi-microphone signals to address these challenges and improve emotion classification accuracy. We adopt a state-of-the-art transformer model, the HTS-AT, to handle multi-channel audio inputs. We evaluate two strategies: averaging mel-spectrograms across channels and summing patch-embedded representations. Our multi-microphone model achieves superior performance compared to single-channel baselines when tested on real-world reverberant environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiran Lin, Anna Gerchanovsky, Omer Akgul, Lujo Bauer, Matt Fredrikson, Zifan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Writing effective prompts for large language models (LLM) can be unintuitive and burdensome. In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avital Shafran, Roei Schuster, Vitaly Shmatikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database, then generating an answer by applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to a new class of denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query - ostensibly because it lacks the information or because the answer is unsafe.
  We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. This method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not use an auxiliary LLM to generate blocker documents.
  We evaluate jamming attacks on several LLMs and embeddings and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Li, Yulin Wu, Nuoxian Huang, Wenjia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding spatial location and relationships is a fundamental capability for modern artificial intelligence systems. Insights from human spatial cognition provide valuable guidance in this domain. Neuroscientific discoveries have highlighted the role of grid cells as a fundamental neural component for spatial representation, including distance computation, path integration, and scale discernment. In this paper, we introduce a novel positional encoding scheme inspired by Fourier analysis and the latest findings in computational neuroscience regarding grid cells. Assuming that grid cells encode spatial position through a summation of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate the translational invariance of the grid representation during inner product calculations. Additionally, we derive an optimal grid scale ratio for multi-dimensional Euclidean spaces based on principles of biological efficiency. Utilizing these computational principles, we have developed a Grid-cell inspired Positional Encoding technique, termed GridPE, for encoding locations within high-dimensional spaces. We integrated GridPE into the Pyramid Vision Transformer architecture. Our theoretical analysis shows that GridPE provides a unifying framework for positional encoding in arbitrary high-dimensional spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPE significantly enhances the performance of transformers, underscoring the importance of incorporating neuroscientific insights into the design of artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehar Khurana, Neehar Peri, James Hays, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However, publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We do note, however, that such data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion, often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives, we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based foundation models trained on internet-scale image data. Specifically, we propose a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data. Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only and multi-modal (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orson Mengara</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We describe version 2 of the SPICE dataset, a collection of quantum chemistry calculations for training machine learning potentials. It expands on the original dataset by adding much more sampling of chemical space and more data on non-covalent interactions. We train a set of potential energy functions called Nutmeg on it. They are based on the TensorNet architecture. They use a novel mechanism to improve performance on charged and polar molecules, injecting precomputed partial charges into the model to provide a reference for the large scale charge distribution. Evaluation of the new models shows they do an excellent job of reproducing energy differences between conformations, even on highly charged molecules or ones that are significantly larger than the molecules in the training set. They also produce stable molecular dynamics trajectories, and are fast enough to be useful for routine simulation of small molecules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianhui Wan, Zecheng Zhang, Liheng Jiang, Zhaoqi Wang, Yan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Image anomaly detection is a popular research direction, with many methods emerging in recent years due to rapid advancements in computing. The use of artificial intelligence for image anomaly detection has been widely studied. By analyzing images of athlete posture and movement, it is possible to predict injury status and suggest necessary adjustments. Most existing methods rely on convolutional networks to extract information from irrelevant pixel data, limiting model accuracy. This paper introduces a network combining Residual Network (ResNet) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which can predict potential injury types and provide early warnings by analyzing changes in muscle and bone poses from video images. To address the high complexity of this network, the Sparrow search algorithm was used for optimization. Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrated that our model has the smallest error in image anomaly detection compared to other models, showing strong adaptability. This provides a new approach for anomaly detection and predictive analysis in images, contributing to the sustainable development of human health and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guido Di Federico, Louis J. Durlofsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sedigheh Eslami, Gerard de Melo</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language--Image Pre-training (CLIP) has manifested remarkable improvements in zero-shot classification and cross-modal vision-language tasks. Yet, from a geometrical point of view, the CLIP embedding space has been found to have a pronounced modality gap. This gap renders the embedding space overly sparse and disconnected, with different modalities being densely distributed in distinct subregions of the hypersphere. In this work, we aim at answering three main questions: 1. Does sharing the parameter space between the multi-modal encoders reduce the modality gap? 2. Can the gap be mitigated by pushing apart the uni-modal embeddings via intra-modality separation? 3. How do these gap reduction approaches affect the downstream performance? We design AlignCLIP, in order to answer these questions and through extensive experiments, we show that AlignCLIP achieves noticeable enhancements in the cross-modal alignment of the embeddings, and thereby, reduces the modality gap, while improving the performance across several zero-shot and fine-tuning downstream evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungnyun Kim, Kangwook Jang, Sangmin Bae, Hoirin Kim, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) aims to transcribe human speech using both audio and video modalities. In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Rodriguez-Garcia, Jie Mei, Srikanth Ramaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from neuroscience, particularly with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). This has significantly enhanced the replication of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and natural language processing. Despite these advances, ANNs struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency - capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, ANNs often overlook the functional and morphological diversity of the brain, hindering their computational capabilities. Furthermore, incorporating cell-type specific neuromodulatory effects into ANNs with neuronal heterogeneity could enable learning at two spatial scales: spiking behavior at the neuronal level, and synaptic plasticity at the circuit level, thereby potentially enhancing their learning abilities. In this article, we summarize recent bio-inspired models, learning rules and architectures and propose a biologically-informed framework for enhancing ANNs. Our proposed dual-framework approach highlights the potential of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for emulating diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartments to simulate morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how the proposed approach integrates brain-inspired compartmental models and task-driven SNNs, balances bioinspiration and complexity, and provides scalable solutions for pressing AI challenges, such as continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research presents a novel method for predicting service degradation (SD) in computer networks by leveraging early flow features. Our approach focuses on the observable (O) segments of network flows, particularly analyzing Packet Inter-Arrival Time (PIAT) values and other derived metrics, to infer the behavior of non-observable (NO) segments. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we identify an optimal O/NO split threshold of 10 observed delay samples, balancing prediction accuracy and resource utilization. Evaluating models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, we find XGBoost outperforms others, achieving an F1-score of 0.74, balanced accuracy of 0.84, and AUROC of 0.97. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating comprehensive early flow features and the potential of our method to offer a practical solution for monitoring network traffic in resource-constrained environments. This approach ensures enhanced user experience and network performance by preemptively addressing potential SD, providing the basis for a robust framework for maintaining high-quality network services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elahe Delavari, John Moore, Junho Hong, Jaerock Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) control through the application of active inference, a theory derived from neuroscience that conceptualizes the brain as a predictive machine. Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed "surprise") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes. Results from extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show promising outcomes, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability and efficiency, thereby advancing the potential of active inference in real-world autonomous driving applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Muca Cirone, Jad Hamdan, Cristopher Salvi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayden McAlister, Anthony Robins, Lech Szymanski</p>
<p>Abstract: The Dense Associative Memory generalizes the Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in imprecisions and overflow when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe the computational issues in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the Dense Associative Memory, removing dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Li, Hubert P. H. Shum, Toby P. Breckon</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D point clouds play a pivotal role in outdoor scene perception, especially in the context of autonomous driving. Recent advancements in 3D LiDAR segmentation often focus intensely on the spatial positioning and distribution of points for accurate segmentation. However, these methods, while robust in variable conditions, encounter challenges due to sole reliance on coordinates and point intensity, leading to poor isometric invariance and suboptimal segmentation. To tackle this challenge, our work introduces Range-Aware Pointwise Distance Distribution (RAPiD) features and the associated RAPiD-Seg architecture. Our RAPiD features exhibit rigid transformation invariance and effectively adapt to variations in point density, with a design focus on capturing the localized geometry of neighboring structures. They utilize inherent LiDAR isotropic radiation and semantic categorization for enhanced local representation and computational efficiency, while incorporating a 4D distance metric that integrates geometric and surface material reflectivity for improved semantic segmentation. To effectively embed high-dimensional RAPiD features, we propose a double-nested autoencoder structure with a novel class-aware embedding objective to encode high-dimensional features into manageable voxel-wise embeddings. Additionally, we propose RAPiD-Seg which incorporates a channel-wise attention fusion and two effective RAPiD-Seg variants, further optimizing the embedding for enhanced performance and generalization. Our method outperforms contemporary LiDAR segmentation work in terms of mIoU on SemanticKITTI (76.1) and nuScenes (83.6) datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of medical diagnosis has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of large language models (LLMs), yet the challenges of interpretability within these models remain largely unaddressed. This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of LLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic benchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring controllability in diagnostic rigor.</p>

Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this turns out to be equivalent to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maojun Sun, Ruijian Han, Binyan Jiang, Houduo Qi, Defeng Sun, Yancheng Yuan, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in complex data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents that operate iteratively and generatively using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, enhanced by advanced models. Meanwhile, the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention in the operational loop. Additionally, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Jafarian Dehkordi, Yasaman Keshtkarjahromi, Hulya Seferoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on designing a privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) inference protocol for a hierarchical setup, where clients own/generate data, model owners (cloud servers) have a pre-trained ML model, and edge servers perform ML inference on clients' data using the cloud server's ML model. Our goal is to speed up ML inference while providing privacy to both data and the ML model. Our approach (i) uses model-distributed inference (model parallelization) at the edge servers and (ii) reduces the amount of communication to/from the cloud server. Our privacy-preserving hierarchical model-distributed inference, privateMDI design uses additive secret sharing and linearly homomorphic encryption to handle linear calculations in the ML inference, and garbled circuit and a novel three-party oblivious transfer are used to handle non-linear functions. privateMDI consists of offline and online phases. We designed these phases in a way that most of the data exchange is done in the offline phase while the communication overhead of the online phase is reduced. In particular, there is no communication to/from the cloud server in the online phase, and the amount of communication between the client and edge servers is minimized. The experimental results demonstrate that privateMDI significantly reduces the ML inference time as compared to the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunin Lee, Chanwoo Park, David Abel, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Black swan events are statistically rare occurrences that carry extremely high risks. A typical view of defining black swan events is heavily assumed to originate from an unpredictable time-varying environments; however, the community lacks a comprehensive definition of black swan events. To this end, this paper challenges that the standard view is incomplete and claims that high-risk, statistically rare events can also occur in unchanging environments due to human misperception of their value and likelihood, which we call as spatial black swan event. We first carefully categorize black swan events, focusing on spatial black swan events, and mathematically formalize the definition of black swan events. We hope these definitions can pave the way for the development of algorithms to prevent such events by rationally correcting human perception.</p>

<p>Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive mental health condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. This work presents a novel, BiLSTM-based tri-modal model-level fusion architecture for the binary classification of depression from clinical interview recordings. The proposed architecture incorporates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Facial Action Units, and uses a two-shot learning based GPT-4 model to process text data. This is the first work to incorporate large language models into a multi-modal architecture for this task. It achieves impressive results on the DAIC-WOZ AVEC 2016 Challenge cross-validation split and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation split, surpassing all baseline models and multiple state-of-the-art models. In Leave-One-Subject-Out testing, it achieves an accuracy of 91.01%, an F1-Score of 85.95%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 92.86%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Zambre, Ekdev Rajkitkul, Akshatha Mohan, Joshua Peeples</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision by autonomously locating and identifying objects of interest. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is an effective single-shot detector. However, YOLO faces challenges in cluttered or partially occluded scenes and can struggle with small, low-contrast objects. We propose a new method that integrates spatial transformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed STN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important areas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the detection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different localization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the model across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on benchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset from a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Tang, Ben Abbatematteo, Jiaheng Hu, Rohan Chandra, Roberto Mart\'in-Mart\'in, Peter Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly its combination with deep neural networks referred to as deep RL (DRL), has shown tremendous promise across a wide range of applications, suggesting its potential for enabling the development of sophisticated robotic behaviors. Robotics problems, however, pose fundamental difficulties for the application of RL, stemming from the complexity and cost of interacting with the physical world. This article provides a modern survey of DRL for robotics, with a particular focus on evaluating the real-world successes achieved with DRL in realizing several key robotic competencies. Our analysis aims to identify the key factors underlying those exciting successes, reveal underexplored areas, and provide an overall characterization of the status of DRL in robotics. We highlight several important avenues for future work, emphasizing the need for stable and sample-efficient real-world RL paradigms, holistic approaches for discovering and integrating various competencies to tackle complex long-horizon, open-world tasks, and principled development and evaluation procedures. This survey is designed to offer insights for both RL practitioners and roboticists toward harnessing RL's power to create generally capable real-world robotic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Traini, Federico Di Menna, Vittorio Cortellessa</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance testing aims at uncovering efficiency issues of software systems. In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei You, Haotian Shi, Zhuoyu Jiang, Zilin Huang, Rui Gan, Keshu Wu, Xi Cheng, Xiaopeng Li, Bin Ran</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in autonomous driving have increasingly focused on end-to-end (E2E) systems that manage the full spectrum of driving tasks, from environmental perception to vehicle navigation and control. This paper introduces V2X-VLM, an innovative E2E vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving (VICAD) framework with Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems and large vision-language models (VLMs). V2X-VLM is designed to enhance situational awareness, decision-making, and ultimate trajectory planning by integrating multimodel data from vehicle-mounted cameras, infrastructure sensors, and textual information. The contrastive learning method is further employed to complement VLM by refining feature discrimination, assisting the model to learn robust representations of the driving environment. Evaluations on the DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art cooperative autonomous driving methods, while additional tests on corner cases validate its robustness in real-world driving conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixiang Zhang, Baturalp Yalcin, Javad Lavaei, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the system identification problem for parameterized non-linear systems using basis functions under adversarial attacks. Motivated by the LASSO-type estimators, we analyze the exact recovery property of a non-smooth estimator, which is generated by solving an embedded $\ell_1$-loss minimization problem. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-specifiedness of the estimator and the uniqueness of global solutions to the underlying optimization problem. Next, we provide exact recovery guarantees for the estimator under two different scenarios of boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of the basis functions. The non-asymptotic exact recovery is guaranteed with high probability, even when there are more severely corrupted data than clean data. Finally, we numerically illustrate the validity of our theory. This is the first study on the sample complexity analysis of a non-smooth estimator for the non-linear system identification problem.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04081">UI-JEPA: Towards Active Perception of User Intent through Onscreen User Activity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Fu, Raviteja Anantha, Prabal Vashisht, Jianpeng Cheng, Etai Littwin</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating user intent from a sequence of user interface (UI) actions is a core challenge in comprehensive UI understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in this area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power, and high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight, on-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight models. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that employs masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for user intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal datasets, "Intent in the Wild" (IIW) and "Intent in the Tame" (IIT), designed for few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos across 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10 categories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that representations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM decoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of state-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and deployment resources. Measured by intent similarity scores, UI-JEPA outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 10.0% and 7.2% respectively, averaged across two datasets. Notably, UI-JEPA accomplishes the performance with a 50.5x reduction in computational cost and a 6.6x improvement in latency in the IIW dataset. These results underscore the effectiveness of UI-JEPA, highlighting its potential for lightweight, high-performance UI understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan-Hao Wei, Yan-Jie Sun, Chen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference and inverse problems are closely related concepts, both fundamentally involving the deduction of unknown causes or parameters from observed data. Bayesian inference, a powerful class of methods, is often employed to solve a variety of problems, including those related to causal inference. Variational inference, a subset of Bayesian inference, is primarily used to efficiently approximate complex posterior distributions. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which combine variational inference with deep learning, have become widely applied across various domains. This study explores the potential of VAEs for solving inverse problems, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without relying on an explicit inverse mapping process. Unlike other VAE-based ICA methods, this approach discards the encoder in the VAE architecture, directly setting the latent variables as trainable parameters. In other words, the latent variables are no longer outputs of the encoder but are instead optimized directly through the objective function to converge to appropriate values. We find that, with a suitable prior setup, the latent variables, represented by trainable parameters, can exhibit mutually independent properties as the parameters converge, all without the need for an encoding process. This approach, referred to as the Half-VAE, bypasses the inverse mapping process by eliminating the encoder. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the Half-VAE to solve ICA without the need for an explicit inverse mapping process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Xinming Wu, Luming Liang, Hanlin Sheng, Xu Si, Gao Hui, Yaxing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Seismic geobody interpretation is crucial for structural geology studies and various engineering applications. Existing deep learning methods show promise but lack support for multi-modal inputs and struggle to generalize to different geobody types or surveys. We introduce a promptable foundation model for interpreting any geobodies across seismic surveys. This model integrates a pre-trained vision foundation model (VFM) with a sophisticated multi-modal prompt engine. The VFM, pre-trained on massive natural images and fine-tuned on seismic data, provides robust feature extraction for cross-survey generalization. The prompt engine incorporates multi-modal prior information to iteratively refine geobody delineation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, scalability from 2D to 3D, and generalizability to various geobody types, including those unseen during training. To our knowledge, this is the first highly scalable and versatile multi-modal foundation model capable of interpreting any geobodies across surveys while supporting real-time interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for geoscientific data interpretation, with broad potential for transfer to other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Maatouk, Kenny Chirino Ampudia, Rex Ying, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Muttenthaler, Klaus Greff, Frieda Born, Bernhard Spitzer, Simon Kornblith, Michael C. Mozer, Klaus-Robert M\"uller, Thomas Unterthiner, Andrew K. Lampinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behavior in vision tasks. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. What is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-like behavior? We highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgments, then transfer human-like structure from its representations into pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behavior and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a new dataset of human judgments spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognition and more practically useful, thus paving the way toward more robust, interpretable, and human-like artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangyang Luo, Shuai Wang, Yexuan Fu, Renrong Shao, Xiang Li, Yunshi Lan, Ming Gao, Jinlong Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning scheme in which clients jointly participate in the collaborative training of a global model by sharing model information rather than their private datasets. In light of concerns associated with communication and privacy, one-shot FL with a single communication round has emerged as a de facto promising solution. However, existing one-shot FL methods either require public datasets, focus on model homogeneous settings, or distill limited knowledge from local models, making it difficult or even impractical to train a robust global model. To address these limitations, we propose a new data-free dual-generator adversarial distillation method (namely DFDG) for one-shot FL, which can explore a broader local models' training space via training dual generators. DFDG is executed in an adversarial manner and comprises two parts: dual-generator training and dual-model distillation. In dual-generator training, we delve into each generator concerning fidelity, transferability and diversity to ensure its utility, and additionally tailor the cross-divergence loss to lessen the overlap of dual generators' output spaces. In dual-model distillation, the trained dual generators work together to provide the training data for updates of the global model. At last, our extensive experiments on various image classification tasks show that DFDG achieves significant performance gains in accuracy compared to SOTA baselines.</p>

Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) have been developed and witnessed remarkable success in data fitting. This study presents Taylor series based KAN (TaylorKAN). Then, different KANs are explored on four realistic image databases (BID2011, CID2013, CLIVE, and KonIQ-10k) for score prediction by using 15 mid-level features and 2048 high-level features. When setting support vector regression as the baseline, experimental results indicate KANs are generally better or competitive, TaylorKAN is the best on three databases using mid-level feature input, while KANs are inferior on CLIVE when high-level features are used. This is the first study that explores KANs for image quality assessment. It sheds lights on how to select and improve KANs on related tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Autonomous driving systems (ADS) have transformed our daily life, safety of ADS is of growing significance. While various testing approaches have emerged to enhance the ADS reliability, a crucial gap remains in understanding the accidents causes. Such post-accident analysis is paramount and beneficial for enhancing ADS safety and reliability. Existing cyber-physical system (CPS) root cause analysis techniques are mainly designed for drones and cannot handle the unique challenges introduced by more complex physical environments and deep learning models deployed in ADS. In this paper, we address the gap by offering a formal definition of ADS root cause analysis problem and introducing ROCAS, a novel ADS root cause analysis framework featuring cyber-physical co-mutation. Our technique uniquely leverages both physical and cyber mutation that can precisely identify the accident-trigger entity and pinpoint the misconfiguration of the target ADS responsible for an accident. We further design a differential analysis to identify the responsible module to reduce search space for the misconfiguration. We study 12 categories of ADS accidents and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROCAS in narrowing down search space and pinpointing the misconfiguration. We also show detailed case studies on how the identified misconfiguration helps understand rationale behind accidents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andi Peng, Belinda Z. Li, Ilia Sucholutsky, Nishanth Kumar, Julie A. Shah, Jacob Andreas, Andreea Bobu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many approaches to robot learning begin by inferring a reward function from a set of human demonstrations. To learn a good reward, it is necessary to determine which features of the environment are relevant before determining how these features should be used to compute reward. End-to-end methods for joint feature and reward learning (e.g., using deep networks or program synthesis techniques) often yield brittle reward functions that are sensitive to spurious state features. By contrast, humans can often generalizably learn from a small number of demonstrations by incorporating strong priors about what features of a demonstration are likely meaningful for a task of interest. How do we build robots that leverage this kind of background knowledge when learning from new demonstrations? This paper describes a method named ALGAE (Adaptive Language-Guided Abstraction from [Contrastive] Explanations) which alternates between using language models to iteratively identify human-meaningful features needed to explain demonstrated behavior, then standard inverse reinforcement learning techniques to assign weights to these features. Experiments across a variety of both simulated and real-world robot environments show that ALGAE learns generalizable reward functions defined on interpretable features using only small numbers of demonstrations. Importantly, ALGAE can recognize when features are missing, then extract and define those features without any human input -- making it possible to quickly and efficiently acquire rich representations of user behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakan T. Otal, M. Abdullah Canbaz</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyber threats necessitates innovative solutions for detecting and analyzing malicious activity. Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiru Gong, Qimin Zhang, Huili Zheng, Zheyan Liu, Shaohan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies revealed structural and functional brain changes in heavy smokers. However, the specific changes in topological brain connections are not well understood. We used Gaussian Undirected Graphs with the graphical lasso algorithm on rs-fMRI data from smokers and non-smokers to identify significant changes in brain connections. Our results indicate high stability in the estimated graphs and identify several brain regions significantly affected by smoking, providing valuable insights for future clinical research.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09003">Model-independent variable selection via the rule-based variable priority</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Lu, Hemant Ishwaran</p>
<p>Abstract: While achieving high prediction accuracy is a fundamental goal in machine learning, an equally important task is finding a small number of features with high explanatory power. One popular selection technique is permutation importance, which assesses a variable's impact by measuring the change in prediction error after permuting the variable. However, this can be problematic due to the need to create artificial data, a problem shared by other methods as well. Another problem is that variable selection methods can be limited by being model-specific. We introduce a new model-independent approach, Variable Priority (VarPro), which works by utilizing rules without the need to generate artificial data or evaluate prediction error. The method is relatively easy to use, requiring only the calculation of sample averages of simple statistics, and can be applied to many data settings, including regression, classification, and survival. We investigate the asymptotic properties of VarPro and show, among other things, that VarPro has a consistent filtering property for noise variables. Empirical studies using synthetic and real-world data show the method achieves a balanced performance and compares favorably to many state-of-the-art procedures currently used for variable selection.</p>
