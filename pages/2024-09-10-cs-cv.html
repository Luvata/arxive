<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuze Wang, Junyi Wang, Chen Wang, Wantong Duan, Yongtang Bao, Yue Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel continual learning framework for synthesising novel views of multiple scenes, learning multiple 3D scenes incrementally, and updating the network parameters only with the training data of the upcoming new scene. We build on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which uses multi-layer perceptron to model the density and radiance field of a scene as the implicit function. While NeRF and its extensions have shown a powerful capability of rendering photo-realistic novel views in a single 3D scene, managing these growing 3D NeRF assets efficiently is a new scientific problem. Very few works focus on the efficient representation or continuous learning capability of multiple scenes, which is crucial for the practical applications of NeRF. To achieve these goals, our key idea is to represent multiple scenes as the linear combination of a cross-scene weight matrix and a set of scene-specific weight matrices generated from a global parameter generator. Furthermore, we propose an uncertain surface knowledge distillation strategy to transfer the radiance field knowledge of previous scenes to the new model. Representing multiple 3D scenes with such weight matrices significantly reduces memory requirements. At the same time, the uncertain surface distillation strategy greatly overcomes the catastrophic forgetting problem and maintains the photo-realistic rendering quality of previous scenes. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality of continual learning NeRF on NeRF-Synthetic, LLFF, and TanksAndTemples datasets while preserving extra low storage cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gemma Canet Tarr\'es, Zhe Lin, Zhifei Zhang, Jianming Zhang, Yizhi Song, Dan Ruta, Andrew Gilbert, John Collomosse, Soo Ye Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositing an object into an image involves multiple non-trivial sub-tasks such as object placement and scaling, color/lighting harmonization, viewpoint/geometry adjustment, and shadow/reflection generation. Recent generative image compositing methods leverage diffusion models to handle multiple sub-tasks at once. However, existing models face limitations due to their reliance on masking the original object during training, which constrains their generation to the input mask. Furthermore, obtaining an accurate input mask specifying the location and scale of the object in a new image can be highly challenging. To overcome such limitations, we define a novel problem of unconstrained generative object compositing, i.e., the generation is not bounded by the mask, and train a diffusion-based model on a synthesized paired dataset. Our first-of-its-kind model is able to generate object effects such as shadows and reflections that go beyond the mask, enhancing image realism. Additionally, if an empty mask is provided, our model automatically places the object in diverse natural locations and scales, accelerating the compositing workflow. Our model outperforms existing object placement and compositing models in various quality metrics and user studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on generating hand grasp over objects. Compared to previous works of generating hand poses with a given object, we aim to allow the generalization of both hand and object shapes by a single model. Our proposed method Multi-modal Grasp Diffusion (MGD) learns the prior and conditional posterior distribution of both modalities from heterogeneous data sources. Therefore it relieves the limitation of hand-object grasp datasets by leveraging the large-scale 3D object datasets. According to both qualitative and quantitative experiments, both conditional and unconditional generation of hand grasp achieve good visual plausibility and diversity. The proposed method also generalizes well to unseen object shapes. The code and weights will be available at \url{https://github.com/noahcao/mgd}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixin Zhang, Yongjun Li, Dong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image clustering, which involves grouping images into different clusters without labels, is a key task in unsupervised learning. Although previous deep clustering methods have achieved remarkable results, they only explore the intrinsic information of the image itself but overlook external supervision knowledge to improve the semantic understanding of images. Recently, visual-language pre-trained model on large-scale datasets have been used in various downstream tasks and have achieved great results. However, there is a gap between visual representation learning and textual semantic learning, and how to properly utilize the representation of two different modalities for clustering is still a big challenge. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel image clustering framwork, named Dual-level Cross-Modal Contrastive Clustering (DXMC). Firstly, external textual information is introduced for constructing a semantic space which is adopted to generate image-text pairs. Secondly, the image-text pairs are respectively sent to pre-trained image and text encoder to obtain image and text embeddings which subsquently are fed into four well-designed networks. Thirdly, dual-level cross-modal contrastive learning is conducted between discriminative representations of different modalities and distinct level. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas W. Remedios, Han Liu, Samuel W. Remedios, Lianrui Zuo, Adam M. Saunders, Shunxing Bao, Yuankai Huo, Alvin C. Powers, John Virostko, Bennett A. Landman</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal fusion promises better pancreas segmentation. However, where to perform fusion in models is still an open question. It is unclear if there is a best location to fuse information when analyzing pairs of imperfectly aligned images. Two main alignment challenges in this pancreas segmentation study are 1) the pancreas is deformable and 2) breathing deforms the abdomen. Even after image registration, relevant deformations are often not corrected. We examine how early through late fusion impacts pancreas segmentation. We used 353 pairs of T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) abdominal MR images from 163 subjects with accompanying pancreas labels. We used image registration (deeds) to align the image pairs. We trained a collection of basic UNets with different fusion points, spanning from early to late, to assess how early through late fusion influenced segmentation performance on imperfectly aligned images. We assessed generalization of fusion points on nnUNet. The single-modality T2w baseline using a basic UNet model had a Dice score of 0.73, while the same baseline on the nnUNet model achieved 0.80. For the basic UNet, the best fusion approach occurred in the middle of the encoder (early/mid fusion), which led to a statistically significant improvement of 0.0125 on Dice score compared to the baseline. For the nnUNet, the best fusion approach was na\"ive image concatenation before the model (early fusion), which resulted in a statistically significant Dice score increase of 0.0021 compared to baseline. Fusion in specific blocks can improve performance, but the best blocks for fusion are model specific, and the gains are small. In imperfectly registered datasets, fusion is a nuanced problem, with the art of design remaining vital for uncovering potential insights. Future innovation is needed to better address fusion in cases of imperfect alignment of abdominal image pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Serna-Aguilera, Xuan Bac Nguyen, Han-Seok Seo, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can affect individuals at varying degrees of intensity, from challenges in overall health, communication, and sensory processing, and this often begins at a young age. Thus, it is critical for medical professionals to be able to accurately diagnose ASD in young children, but doing so is difficult. Deep learning can be responsibly leveraged to improve productivity in addressing this task. The availability of data, however, remains a considerable obstacle. Hence, in this work, we introduce the Video ASD dataset--a dataset that contains video frame convolutional and attention map feature data--to foster further progress in the task of ASD classification. The original videos showcase children reacting to chemo-sensory stimuli, among auditory, touch, and vision This dataset contains the features of the frames spanning 2,467 videos, for a total of approximately 1.4 million frames. Additionally, head pose angles are included to account for head movement noise, as well as full-sentence text labels for the taste and smell videos that describe how the facial expression changes before, immediately after, and long after interaction with the stimuli. In addition to providing features, we also test foundation models on this data to showcase how movement noise affects performance and the need for more data and more complex labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Lu, Dezong Zhao, Cristiano Premebida, Li Zhang, Wenjing Zhao, Daxin Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective point cloud processing is crucial to LiDARbased autonomous driving systems. The capability to understand features at multiple scales is required for object detection of intelligent vehicles, where road users may appear in different sizes. Recent methods focus on the design of the feature aggregation operators, which collect features at different scales from the encoder backbone and assign them to the points of interest. While efforts are made into the aggregation modules, the importance of how to fuse these multi-scale features has been overlooked. This leads to insufficient feature communication across scales. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Point Pyramid RCNN (POP-RCNN), a feature pyramid-based framework for 3D object detection on point clouds. POP-RCNN consists of a Point Pyramid Feature Enhancement (PPFE) module to establish connections across spatial scales and semantic depths for information exchange. The PPFE module effectively fuses multi-scale features for rich information without the increased complexity in feature aggregation. To remedy the impact of inconsistent point densities, a point density confidence module is deployed. This design integration enables the use of a lightweight feature aggregator, and the emphasis on both shallow and deep semantics, realising a detection framework for 3D object detection. With great adaptability, the proposed method can be applied to a variety of existing frameworks to increase feature richness, especially for long-distance detection. By adopting the PPFE in the voxel-based and point-voxel-based baselines, experimental results on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance even with limited computational headroom.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyne Oei, Amr Gomaa, Anna Maria Feit, Jo\~ao Belo</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust frame-wise embeddings are essential to perform video analysis and understanding tasks. We present a self-supervised method for representation learning based on aligning temporal video sequences. Our framework uses a transformer-based encoder to extract frame-level features and leverages them to find the optimal alignment path between video sequences. We introduce the novel Local-Alignment Contrastive (LAC) loss, which combines a differentiable local alignment loss to capture local temporal dependencies with a contrastive loss to enhance discriminative learning. Prior works on video alignment have focused on using global temporal ordering across sequence pairs, whereas our loss encourages identifying the best-scoring subsequence alignment. LAC uses the differentiable Smith-Waterman (SW) affine method, which features a flexible parameterization learned through the training phase, enabling the model to adjust the temporal gap penalty length dynamically. Evaluations show that our learned representations outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches on action recognition tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun Krishna, Ge Wang, Klaus Mueller</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical imaging applications are highly specialized in terms of human anatomy, pathology, and imaging domains. Therefore, annotated training datasets for training deep learning applications in medical imaging not only need to be highly accurate but also diverse and large enough to encompass almost all plausible examples with respect to those specifications. We argue that achieving this goal can be facilitated through a controlled generation framework for synthetic images with annotations, requiring multiple conditional specifications as input to provide control. We employ a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to train a large-scale generative model in the lung CT domain and expand upon a classifier-free sampling strategy to showcase one such generation framework. We show that our approach can produce annotated lung CT images that can faithfully represent anatomy, convincingly fooling experts into perceiving them as real. Our experiments demonstrate that controlled generative frameworks of this nature can surpass nearly every state-of-the-art image generative model in achieving anatomical consistency in generated medical images when trained on comparable large medical datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaobing Zheng, Yilun Xu, Weihai Chen, Shiqian Wu, Zhengguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to saturated regions of inputting low dynamic range (LDR) images and large intensity changes among the LDR images caused by different exposures, it is challenging to produce an information enriched panoramic LDR image without visual artifacts for a high dynamic range (HDR) scene through stitching multiple geometrically synchronized LDR images with different exposures and pairwise overlapping fields of views (OFOVs). Fortunately, the stitching of such images is innately a perfect scenario for the fusion of a physics-driven approach and a data-driven approach due to their OFOVs. Based on this new insight, a novel neural augmentation based panoramic HDR stitching algorithm is proposed in this paper. The physics-driven approach is built up using the OFOVs. Different exposed images of each view are initially generated by using the physics-driven approach, are then refined by a data-driven approach, and are finally used to produce panoramic LDR images with different exposures. All the panoramic LDR images with different exposures are combined together via a multi-scale exposure fusion algorithm to produce the final panoramic LDR image. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing panoramic stitching algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Wang,  ALuSi, Xun Yang, Ke Xu, Huibin Tan, Xingyi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) task aims to learn a robust model from source domains that could handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. In order to improve the generalization ability of the model in unseen domains, increasing the diversity of training samples is an effective solution. However, existing augmentation approaches always have some limitations. On the one hand, the augmentation manner in most DG methods is not enough as the model may not see the perturbed features in approximate the worst case due to the randomness, thus the transferability in features could not be fully explored. On the other hand, the causality in discriminative features is not involved in these methods, which harms the generalization ability of model due to the spurious correlations. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-stream Feature Augmentation~(DFA) method by constructing some hard features from two perspectives. Firstly, to improve the transferability, we construct some targeted features with domain related augmentation manner. Through the guidance of uncertainty, some hard cross-domain fictitious features are generated to simulate domain shift. Secondly, to take the causality into consideration, the spurious correlated non-causal information is disentangled by an adversarial mask, then the more discriminative features can be extracted through these hard causal related information. Different from previous fixed synthesizing strategy, the two augmentations are integrated into a unified learnable feature disentangle model. Based on these hard features, contrastive learning is employed to keep the semantic consistency and improve the robustness of the model. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrated that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance for domain generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjin Zhang, Chi Zhang, Qiming Zhang, Yunsong Li, Xinbo Gao, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have greatly advanced the field of infrared small object detection (IRSTD). Despite their remarkable success, a notable gap persists between these IRSTD methods and generic segmentation approaches in natural image domains. This gap primarily arises from the significant modality differences and the limited availability of infrared data. In this study, we aim to bridge this divergence by investigating the adaptation of generic segmentation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to IRSTD tasks. Our investigation reveals that many generic segmentation models can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art IRSTD methods. However, their full potential in IRSTD remains untapped. To address this, we propose a simple, lightweight, yet effective baseline model for segmenting small infrared objects. Through appropriate distillation strategies, we empower smaller student models to outperform state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing fine-tuned teacher results. Furthermore, we enhance the model's performance by introducing a novel query design comprising dense and sparse queries to effectively encode multi-scale features. Through extensive experimentation across four popular IRSTD datasets, our model demonstrates significantly improved performance in both accuracy and throughput compared to existing approaches, surpassing SAM and Semantic-SAM by over 14 IoU on NUDT and 4 IoU on IRSTD1k.

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZhiChao Yan, Hui Xue, Yi Zhu, Bin Xiao, Hao Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. However, the collection of enough crisp EUS images for effective diagnosis is arduous. Recently, domain adaptation (DA) has been employed to address these challenges by leveraging related knowledge from other domains. Most DA methods only focus on multi-view representations of the same organ, which makes it still tough to clearly depict the tumor lesion area with limited semantic information. Although transferring homogeneous similarity from different organs could benefit the issue, there is a lack of relevant work due to the enormous domain gap between them. To address these challenges, we propose the Cross-Organ Tumor Segmentation Networks (COTS-Nets), consisting of a universal network and an auxiliary network. The universal network utilizes boundary loss to learn common boundary information of different tumors, enabling accurate delineation of tumors in EUS despite limited and low-quality data. Simultaneously, we incorporate consistency loss in the universal network to align the prediction of pancreatic EUS with tumor boundaries from other organs to mitigate the domain gap. To further reduce the cross-organ domain gap, the auxiliary network integrates multi-scale features from different organs, aiding the universal network in acquiring domain-invariant knowledge. Systematic experiments demonstrate that COTS-Nets significantly improves the accuracy of pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Additionally, we developed the Pancreatic Cancer Endoscopic Ultrasound (PCEUS) dataset, comprising 501 pathologically confirmed pancreatic EUS images, to facilitate model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadmahdi Honarmand, Muhammad Abdullah Jamal, Omid Mohareri</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce VidLPRO, a novel video-language (VL) pre-training framework designed specifically for robotic and laparoscopic surgery. While existing surgical VL models primarily rely on contrastive learning, we propose a more comprehensive approach to capture the intricate temporal dynamics and align video with language. VidLPRO integrates video-text contrastive learning, video-text matching, and masked language modeling objectives to learn rich VL representations. To support this framework, we present GenSurg+, a carefully curated dataset derived from GenSurgery, comprising 17k surgical video clips paired with captions generated by GPT-4 using transcripts extracted by the Whisper model. This dataset addresses the need for large-scale, high-quality VL data in the surgical domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including Cholec80 and AutoLaparo, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. VidLPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot surgical phase recognition, significantly outperforming existing surgical VL models such as SurgVLP and HecVL. Our model demonstrates improvements of up to 21.5\% in accuracy and 15.7% in F1 score, setting a new benchmark in the field. Notably, VidLPRO exhibits robust performance even with single-frame inference, while effectively scaling with increased temporal context. Ablation studies reveal the impact of frame sampling strategies on model performance and computational efficiency. These results underscore VidLPRO's potential as a foundation model for surgical video understanding.</p>

The model's performance was evaluated through intra-dataset and inter-dataset testing across three distinct datasets: CiFAKE, JSSSTU, and Columbia. The datasets were tested individually (D1, D2, D3) and in combination (D1+D2+D3) to assess the model's robustness and domain generalization capabilities.
  \textbf{Results} The Swin Transformer-based model demonstrated high accuracy, consistently achieving a range of 97-99\% across all datasets and testing scenarios. These results confirm the model's effectiveness in detecting CGI, showcasing its robustness and reliability in both intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluations.
  \textbf{Conclusion} The findings of this study highlight the Swin Transformer model's potential as an advanced tool for digital image forensics, particularly in distinguishing CGI from natural images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Preeti Mehta, Aman Sagar, Suchi Kumari</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in computer graphics have greatly enhanced the quality of computer-generated images (CGI), making them increasingly indistinguishable from authentic images captured by digital cameras (ADI). This indistinguishability poses significant challenges, especially in an era of widespread misinformation and digitally fabricated content. This research proposes a novel approach to classify CGI and ADI using Swin Transformers and preprocessing techniques involving RGB and CbCrY color frame analysis. By harnessing the capabilities of Swin Transformers, our method foregoes handcrafted features instead of relying on raw pixel data for model training. This approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while offering substantial improvements in processing speed and robustness against joint image manipulations such as noise addition, blurring, and JPEG compression. Our findings highlight the potential of Swin Transformers combined with advanced color frame analysis for effective and efficient image authenticity detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lele Chang, Peilin Liu, Qinghai Guo, Fei Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been extensively studied. Theoretically, mutual information maximization (MIM) is an optimal criterion for SSL, with a strong theoretical foundation in information theory. However, it is difficult to directly apply MIM in SSL since the data distribution is not analytically available in applications. In practice, many existing methods can be viewed as approximate implementations of the MIM criterion. This work shows that, based on the invariance property of MI, explicit MI maximization can be applied to SSL under a generic distribution assumption, i.e., a relaxed condition of the data distribution. We further illustrate this by analyzing the generalized Gaussian distribution. Based on this result, we derive a loss function based on the MIM criterion using only second-order statistics. We implement the new loss for SSL and demonstrate its effectiveness via extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guandong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating style-consistent images is a common task in the e-commerce field, and current methods are largely based on diffusion models, which have achieved excellent results. This paper introduces the concept of the QKV (query/key/value) level, referring to modifications in the attention maps (self-attention and cross-attention) when integrating UNet with image conditions. Without disrupting the product's main composition in e-commerce images, we aim to use a train-free method guided by pre-set conditions. This involves using shared KV to enhance similarity in cross-attention and generating mask guidance from the attention map to cleverly direct the generation of style-consistent images. Our method has shown promising results in practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered attention for its high fidelity and real-time rendering. However, adapting 3DGS to different camera models, particularly fisheye lenses, poses challenges due to the unique 3D to 2D projection calculation. Additionally, there are inefficiencies in the tile-based splatting, especially for the extreme curvature and wide field of view of fisheye lenses, which are crucial for its broader real-life applications. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fisheye-GS.This innovative method recalculates the projection transformation and its gradients for fisheye cameras. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated as a module into other efficient 3D rendering methods, emphasizing its extensibility, lightweight nature, and modular design. Since we only modified the projection component, it can also be easily adapted for use with different camera models. Compared to methods that train after undistortion, our approach demonstrates a clear improvement in visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchang Ye, Mingyuan Meng, Mingjian Li, Dagan Feng, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of infected areas in chest X-rays is pivotal for facilitating the accurate delineation of pulmonary structures and pathological anomalies. Recently, multi-modal language-guided image segmentation methods have emerged as a promising solution for chest X-rays where the clinical text reports, depicting the assessment of the images, are used as guidance. Nevertheless, existing language-guided methods require clinical reports alongside the images, and hence, they are not applicable for use in image segmentation in a decision support context, but rather limited to retrospective image analysis after clinical reporting has been completed. In this study, we propose a self-guided segmentation framework (SGSeg) that leverages language guidance for training (multi-modal) while enabling text-free inference (uni-modal), which is the first that enables text-free inference in language-guided segmentation. We exploit the critical location information of both pulmonary and pathological structures depicted in the text reports and introduce a novel localization-enhanced report generation (LERG) module to generate clinical reports for self-guidance. Our LERG integrates an object detector and a location-based attention aggregator, weakly-supervised by a location-aware pseudo-label extraction module. Extensive experiments on a well-benchmarked QaTa-COV19 dataset demonstrate that our SGSeg achieved superior performance than existing uni-modal segmentation methods and closely matched the state-of-the-art performance of multi-modal language-guided segmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah, Djamel Bouchaffra</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural network learning for image processing faces major challenges related to changes in distribution across layers, which disrupt model convergence and performance. Activation normalization methods, such as Batch Normalization (BN), have revolutionized this field, but they rely on the simplified assumption that data distribution can be modelled by a single Gaussian distribution. To overcome these limitations, Mixture Normalization (MN) introduced an approach based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), assuming multiple components to model the data. However, this method entails substantial computational requirements associated with the use of Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate parameters of each Gaussian components. To address this issue, we introduce Adaptative Context Normalization (ACN), a novel supervised approach that introduces the concept of "context", which groups together a set of data with similar characteristics. Data belonging to the same context are normalized using the same parameters, enabling local representation based on contexts. For each context, the normalized parameters, as the model weights are learned during the backpropagation phase. ACN not only ensures speed, convergence, and superior performance compared to BN and MN but also presents a fresh perspective that underscores its particular efficacy in the field of image processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Chen, Di Huang, Zhichao Liao, Xi Cheng, Xinghui Li, Lone Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The trend of employing training-free methods for point cloud recognition is becoming increasingly popular due to its significant reduction in computational resources and time costs. However, existing approaches are limited as they typically extract either geometric or semantic features. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that integrates both geometric and semantic features, thereby enhancing the comprehensive understanding of point clouds. For the geometric branch, we adopt a non-parametric strategy to extract geometric features. In the semantic branch, we leverage a model pre-trained through contrastive learning and aligned with text features to obtain semantic features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art training-free approaches on several popular benchmark datasets, including ModelNet and ScanObiectNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijing Wang, Yaping Huang, Jun Xie,  YiTian, Feng Chen, Zhepeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving accurate and reliable gaze predictions in complex and diverse environments remains challenging. Fortunately, it is straightforward to access diverse gaze datasets in real-world applications. We discover that training these datasets jointly can significantly improve the generalization of gaze estimation, which is overlooked in previous works. However, due to the inherent distribution shift across different datasets, simply mixing multiple dataset decreases the performance in the original domain despite gaining better generalization abilities. To address the problem of ``cross-dataset gaze estimation'', we propose a novel Evidential Inter-intra Fusion EIF framework, for training a cross-dataset model that performs well across all source and unseen domains. Specifically, we build independent single-dataset branches for various datasets where the data space is partitioned into overlapping subspaces within each dataset for local regression, and further create a cross-dataset branch to integrate the generalizable features from single-dataset branches. Furthermore, evidential regressors based on the Normal and Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution are designed to additionally provide uncertainty estimation apart from predicting gaze. Building upon this foundation, our proposed framework achieves both intra-evidential fusion among multiple local regressors within each dataset and inter-evidential fusion among multiple branches by Mixture \textbfof Normal Inverse-Gamma (MoNIG distribution. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves notable improvements in both source domains and unseen domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04768">Medical Image Segmentation via Single-Source Domain Generalization with Random Amplitude Spectrum Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Qiao, Wenyu Wang, Meixia Qu, Kun Su, Bin Jiang, Qiang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of medical image segmentation is challenged by domain generalization (DG) due to domain shifts in clinical datasets. The DG challenge is exacerbated by the scarcity of medical data and privacy concerns. Traditional single-source domain generalization (SSDG) methods primarily rely on stacking data augmentation techniques to minimize domain discrepancies. In this paper, we propose Random Amplitude Spectrum Synthesis (RASS) as a training augmentation for medical images. RASS enhances model generalization by simulating distribution changes from a frequency perspective. This strategy introduces variability by applying amplitude-dependent perturbations to ensure broad coverage of potential domain variations. Furthermore, we propose random mask shuffle and reconstruction components, which can enhance the ability of the backbone to process structural information and increase resilience intra- and cross-domain changes. The proposed Random Amplitude Spectrum Synthesis for Single-Source Domain Generalization (RAS^4DG) is validated on 3D fetal brain images and 2D fundus photography, and achieves an improved DG segmentation performance compared to other SSDG models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04796">Enhancing Outlier Knowledge for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection with Extensible Local Prompts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanhu Zeng, Zhen Cheng, Fei Zhu, Xu-Yao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to distinguish outliers from known categories, has gained prominence in practical scenarios. Recently, the advent of vision-language models (VLM) has heightened interest in enhancing OOD detection for VLM through few-shot tuning. However, existing methods mainly focus on optimizing global prompts, ignoring refined utilization of local information with regard to outliers. Motivated by this, we freeze global prompts and introduce a novel coarse-to-fine tuning paradigm to emphasize regional enhancement with local prompts. Our method comprises two integral components: global prompt guided negative augmentation and local prompt enhanced regional regularization. The former utilizes frozen, coarse global prompts as guiding cues to incorporate negative augmentation, thereby leveraging local outlier knowledge. The latter employs trainable local prompts and a regional regularization to capture local information effectively, aiding in outlier identification. We also propose regional-related metric to empower the enrichment of OOD detection. Moreover, since our approach explores enhancing local prompts only, it can be seamlessly integrated with trained global prompts during inference to boost the performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our method. Notably, our method reduces average FPR95 by 5.17% against state-of-the-art method in 4-shot tuning on challenging ImageNet-1k dataset, even outperforming 16-shot results of previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models significantly enhance the efficiency of artistic creation with high-fidelity image generation. However, in typical application scenarios like comic book production, they can neither place each subject into its expected spot nor maintain the consistent appearance of each subject across images. For these issues, we pioneer a novel task, Layout-to-Consistent-Image (L2CI) generation, which produces consistent and compositional images in accordance with the given layout conditions and text prompts. To accomplish this challenging task, we present a new formalization of dual energy guidance with optimization in a dual semantic-latent space and thus propose a training-free pipeline, SpotActor, which features a layout-conditioned backward update stage and a consistent forward sampling stage. In the backward stage, we innovate a nuanced layout energy function to mimic the attention activations with a sigmoid-like objective. While in the forward stage, we design Regional Interconnection Self-Attention (RISA) and Semantic Fusion Cross-Attention (SFCA) mechanisms that allow mutual interactions across images. To evaluate the performance, we present ActorBench, a specified benchmark with hundreds of reasonable prompt-box pairs stemming from object detection datasets. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The results prove that SpotActor fulfills the expectations of this task and showcases the potential for practical applications with superior layout alignment, subject consistency, prompt conformity and background diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Power Line Autonomous Inspection (PLAI) plays a crucial role in the construction of smart grids due to its great advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and safe operation. PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets.

<p>Abstract: Scribble supervised salient object detection (SSSOD) constructs segmentation ability of attractive objects from surroundings under the supervision of sparse scribble labels. For the better segmentation, depth and thermal infrared modalities serve as the supplement to RGB images in the complex scenes. Existing methods specifically design various feature extraction and multi-modal fusion strategies for RGB, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, and Visual-Depth-Thermal image input respectively, leading to similar model flood. As the recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) possesses extraordinary segmentation and prompt interactive capability, we propose an SSSOD family based on SAM, named SSFam, for the combination input with different modalities. Firstly, different modal-aware modulators are designed to attain modal-specific knowledge which cooperates with modal-agnostic information extracted from the frozen SAM encoder for the better feature ensemble. Secondly, a siamese decoder is tailored to bridge the gap between the training with scribble prompt and the testing with no prompt for the stronger decoding ability. Our model demonstrates the remarkable performance among combinations of different modalities and refreshes the highest level of scribble supervised methods and comes close to the ones of fully supervised methods. https://github.com/liuzywen/SSFam</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Top-GAP, a novel regularization technique that enhances the explainability and robustness of convolutional neural networks. By constraining the spatial size of the learned feature representation, our method forces the network to focus on the most salient image regions, effectively reducing background influence. Using adversarial attacks and the Effective Receptive Field, we show that Top-GAP directs more attention towards object pixels rather than the background. This leads to enhanced interpretability and robustness. We achieve over 50% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 with PGD $\epsilon=\frac{8}{255}$ and $20$ iterations while maintaining the original clean accuracy. Furthermore, we see increases of up to 5% accuracy against distribution shifts. Our approach also yields more precise object localization, as evidenced by up to 25% improvement in Intersection over Union (IOU) compared to methods like GradCAM and Recipro-CAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Bekor, Niv Nayman, Lihi Zelnik-Manor</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation has become an integral part of deep learning, as it is known to improve the generalization capabilities of neural networks. Since the most effective set of image transformations differs between tasks and domains, automatic data augmentation search aims to alleviate the extreme burden of manually finding the optimal image transformations. However, current methods are not able to jointly optimize all degrees of freedom: (1) the number of transformations to be applied, their (2) types, (3) order, and (4) magnitudes. Many existing methods risk picking the same transformation more than once, limit the search to two transformations only, or search for the number of transformations exhaustively or iteratively in a myopic manner. Our approach, FreeAugment, is the first to achieve global optimization of all four degrees of freedom simultaneously, using a fully differentiable method. It efficiently learns the number of transformations and a probability distribution over their permutations, inherently refraining from redundant repetition while sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that this joint learning of all degrees of freedom significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various natural image benchmarks and beyond across other domains.

<p>Abstract: Camera trap imagery has become an invaluable asset in contemporary wildlife surveillance, enabling researchers to observe and investigate the behaviors of wild animals. While existing methods rely solely on image data for classification, this may not suffice in cases of suboptimal animal angles, lighting, or image quality. This study introduces a novel approach that enhances wild animal classification by combining specific metadata (temperature, location, time, etc) with image data. Using a dataset focused on the Norwegian climate, our models show an accuracy increase from 98.4% to 98.9% compared to existing methods. Notably, our approach also achieves high accuracy with metadata-only classification, highlighting its potential to reduce reliance on image quality. This work paves the way for integrated systems that advance wildlife classification technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Liu, Zhongyin Zhao, Ziyuan Zhuang, Le Tian, Xiao Zhou, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, vision-language models have made significant strides, excelling in tasks like optical character recognition and geometric problem-solving. However, several critical issues remain: 1) Proprietary models often lack transparency about their architectures, while open-source models need more detailed ablations of their training strategies. 2) Pre-training data in open-source works is under-explored, with datasets added empirically, making the process cumbersome. 3) Fine-tuning often focuses on adding datasets, leading to diminishing returns. To address these issues, we propose the following contributions: 1) We trained a robust baseline model using the latest advancements in vision-language models, introducing effective improvements and conducting comprehensive ablation and validation for each technique. 2) Inspired by recent work on large language models, we filtered pre-training data using perplexity, selecting the lowest perplexity data for training. This approach allowed us to train on a curated 1M dataset, achieving competitive performance. 3) During visual instruction tuning, we used model soup on different datasets when adding more datasets yielded marginal improvements. These innovations resulted in a 9B parameter model that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our strategies are efficient and lightweight, making them easily adoptable by the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have significantly enhanced their capacity for image generation, enabling a wide range of applications such as image editing, completion and video editing. A specialized area within generative modeling is layout-to-image (L2I) generation, where predefined layouts of objects guide the generative process. In this study, we introduce a novel regional cross-attention module tailored to enrich layout-to-image generation. This module notably improves the representation of layout regions, particularly in scenarios where existing methods struggle with highly complex and detailed textual descriptions. Moreover, while current open-vocabulary L2I methods are trained in an open-set setting, their evaluations often occur in closed-set environments. To bridge this gap, we propose two metrics to assess L2I performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive user study to validate the consistency of these metrics with human preferences.</p>

On the other hand, existing multi-modal fusion methods generally require customized designs based on the specific sensor combinations or setups, which limits the flexibility and generality of these methods. Furthermore, conventional point-image projection-based and Transformer-based fusion networks are susceptible to the influence of noisy modalities and sensor poses. To address these limitations and achieve robust 3D human body reconstruction in various conditions, we propose AdaptiveFusion, a generic adaptive multi-modal multi-view fusion framework that can effectively incorporate arbitrary combinations of uncalibrated sensor inputs. By treating different modalities from various viewpoints as equal tokens, and our handcrafted modality sampling module by leveraging the inherent flexibility of Transformer models, AdaptiveFusion is able to cope with arbitrary numbers of inputs and accommodate noisy modalities with only a single training network. Extensive experiments on large-scale human datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptiveFusion in achieving high-quality 3D human body reconstruction in various environments. In addition, our method achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art fusion methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04867">Contrastive Disentangling: Fine-grained representation learning through multi-level contrastive learning without class priors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Houwang Jiang, Zhuxian Liu, Guodong Liu, Xiaolong Liu, Shihua Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in unsupervised representation learning often leverage class information to enhance feature extraction and clustering performance. However, this reliance on class priors limits the applicability of such methods in real-world scenarios where class information is unavailable or ambiguous. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Disentangling (CD), a simple and effective framework that learns representations without any reliance on class priors. Our framework employs a multi-level contrastive learning strategy that combines instance-level and feature-level losses with a normalized entropy loss to learn semantically rich and fine-grained representations. Specifically, (1) the instance-level contrastive loss encourages the separation of feature representations for different samples, (2) the feature-level contrastive loss promotes independence among the feature head predictions, and (3) the normalized entropy loss encourages the feature heads to capture meaningful and prevalent attributes from the data. These components work together to enable CD to significantly outperform existing methods, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and ImageNet-10, particularly in scenarios where class priors are absent.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04888">A Quantitative Approach for Evaluating Disease Focus and Interpretability of Deep Learning Models for Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Yu Chow Tam, Litian Liang, Ke Chen, Haohan Wang, Wei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models have shown significant potential in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification. However, understanding and interpreting these models remains challenging, which hinders the adoption of these models in clinical practice. Techniques such as saliency maps have been proven effective in providing visual and empirical clues about how these models work, but there still remains a gap in understanding which specific brain regions DL models focus on and whether these brain regions are pathologically associated with AD.
  To bridge such gap, in this study, we developed a quantitative disease-focusing strategy to first enhance the interpretability of DL models using saliency maps and brain segmentations; then we propose a disease-focus (DF) score that quantifies how much a DL model focuses on brain areas relevant to AD pathology based on clinically known MRI-based pathological regions of AD. Using this strategy, we compared several state-of-the-art DL models, including a baseline 3D ResNet model, a pretrained MedicalNet model, and a MedicalNet with data augmentation to classify patients with AD vs. cognitive normal patients using MRI data; then we evaluated these models in terms of their abilities to focus on disease-relevant regions. Our results show interesting disease-focusing patterns with different models, particularly characteristic patterns with the pretrained models and data augmentation, and also provide insight into their classification performance. These results suggest that the approach we developed for quantitatively assessing the abilities of DL models to focus on disease-relevant regions may help improve interpretability of these models for AD classification and facilitate their adoption for AD diagnosis in clinical practice.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdur Rahman, Lu He, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation function has a significant impact on the dynamics, convergence, and performance of deep neural networks. The search for a consistent and high-performing activation function has always been a pursuit during deep learning model development. Existing state-of-the-art activation functions are manually designed with human expertise except for Swish. Swish was developed using a reinforcement learning-based search strategy. In this study, we propose an evolutionary approach for optimizing activation functions specifically for image classification tasks, aiming to discover functions that outperform current state-of-the-art options. Through this optimization framework, we obtain a series of high-performing activation functions denoted as Exponential Error Linear Unit (EELU). The developed activation functions are evaluated for image classification tasks from two perspectives: (1) five state-of-the-art neural network architectures, such as ResNet50, AlexNet, VGG16, MobileNet, and Compact Convolutional Transformer which cover computationally heavy to light neural networks, and (2) eight standard datasets, including CIFAR10, Imagenette, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Beans, Colorectal Histology, CottonWeedID15, and TinyImageNet which cover from typical machine vision benchmark, agricultural image applications to medical image applications. Finally, we statistically investigate the generalization of the resultant activation functions developed through the optimization scheme. With a Friedman test, we conclude that the optimization scheme is able to generate activation functions that outperform the existing standard ones in 92.8% cases among 28 different cases studied, and $-x\cdot erf(e^{-x})$ is found to be the best activation function for image classification generated by the optimization scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ren-Di Wu, Yu-Yen Lin, Huei-Fang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR), which formulates the query as a combination of a reference image and modified text, has emerged as a new form of image search due to its enhanced ability to capture users' intentions. However, training a CIR model in a supervised manner typically requires labor-intensive collection of (reference image, text modifier, target image) triplets. While existing zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods eliminate the need for training on specific downstream datasets, they still require additional pretraining with large-scale image-text pairs. In this paper, we introduce a training-free approach for ZS-CIR. Our approach, \textbf{Wei}ghted \textbf{Mo}dality fusion and similarity for \textbf{CIR} (WeiMoCIR), operates under the assumption that image and text modalities can be effectively combined using a simple weighted average. This allows the query representation to be constructed directly from the reference image and text modifier. To further enhance retrieval performance, we employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate image captions for the database images and incorporate these textual captions into the similarity computation by combining them with image information using a weighted average. Our approach is simple, easy to implement, and its effectiveness is validated through experiments on the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdur Rahman, Jason Street, James Wooten, Mohammad Marufuzzaman, Veera G. Gude, Randy Buchanan, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quick and reliable measurement of wood chip moisture content is an everlasting problem for numerous forest-reliant industries such as biofuel, pulp and paper, and bio-refineries. Moisture content is a critical attribute of wood chips due to its direct relationship with the final product quality. Conventional techniques for determining moisture content, such as oven-drying, possess some drawbacks in terms of their time-consuming nature, potential sample damage, and lack of real-time feasibility. Furthermore, alternative techniques, including NIR spectroscopy, electrical capacitance, X-rays, and microwaves, have demonstrated potential; nevertheless, they are still constrained by issues related to portability, precision, and the expense of the required equipment. Hence, there is a need for a moisture content determination method that is instant, portable, non-destructive, inexpensive, and precise. This study explores the use of deep learning and machine vision to predict moisture content classes from RGB images of wood chips. A large-scale image dataset comprising 1,600 RGB images of wood chips has been collected and annotated with ground truth labels, utilizing the results of the oven-drying technique. Two high-performing neural networks, MoistNetLite and MoistNetMax, have been developed leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization. The developed models are evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models. Results demonstrate that MoistNetLite achieves 87% accuracy with minimal computational overhead, while MoistNetMax exhibits exceptional precision with a 91% accuracy in wood chip moisture content class prediction. With improved accuracy and faster prediction speed, our proposed MoistNet models hold great promise for the wood chip processing industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqian Xue, Chi Ding, Jose Principe</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-inspired deep predictive coding networks (DPCNs) effectively model and capture video features through a bi-directional information flow, even without labels. They are based on an overcomplete description of video scenes, and one of the bottlenecks has been the lack of effective sparsification techniques to find discriminative and robust dictionaries. FISTA has been the best alternative. This paper proposes a DPCN with a fast inference of internal model variables (states and causes) that achieves high sparsity and accuracy of feature clustering. The proposed unsupervised learning procedure, inspired by adaptive dynamic programming with a majorization-minimization framework, and its convergence are rigorously analyzed. Experiments in the data sets CIFAR-10, Super Mario Bros video game, and Coil-100 validate the approach, which outperforms previous versions of DPCNs on learning rate, sparsity ratio, and feature clustering accuracy. Because of DCPN's solid foundation and explainability, this advance opens the door for general applications in object recognition in video without labels.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04952">Deep Bayesian Active Learning-to-Rank with Relative Annotation for Estimation of Ulcerative Colitis Severity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Takeaki Kadota, Hideaki Hayashi, Ryoma Bise, Kiyohito Tanaka, Seiichi Uchida</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic image-based severity estimation is an important task in computer-aided diagnosis. Severity estimation by deep learning requires a large amount of training data to achieve a high performance. In general, severity estimation uses training data annotated with discrete (i.e., quantized) severity labels. Annotating discrete labels is often difficult in images with ambiguous severity, and the annotation cost is high. In contrast, relative annotation, in which the severity between a pair of images is compared, can avoid quantizing severity and thus makes it easier. We can estimate relative disease severity using a learning-to-rank framework with relative annotations, but relative annotation has the problem of the enormous number of pairs that can be annotated. Therefore, the selection of appropriate pairs is essential for relative annotation. In this paper, we propose a deep Bayesian active learning-to-rank that automatically selects appropriate pairs for relative annotation. Our method preferentially annotates unlabeled pairs with high learning efficiency from the model uncertainty of the samples. We prove the theoretical basis for adapting Bayesian neural networks to pairwise learning-to-rank and demonstrate the efficiency of our method through experiments on endoscopic images of ulcerative colitis on both private and public datasets. We also show that our method achieves a high performance under conditions of significant class imbalance because it automatically selects samples from the minority classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yu, WenJian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recycled and recirculated books, such as ancient texts and reused textbooks, hold significant value in the second-hand goods market, with their worth largely dependent on surface preservation. However, accurately assessing surface defects is challenging due to the wide variations in shape, size, and the often imprecise detection of defects. To address these issues, we propose DDNet, an innovative detection model designed to enhance defect localization and classification. DDNet introduces a surface defect feature extraction module based on a deformable convolution operator (DC) and a densely connected FPN module (DFPN). The DC module dynamically adjusts the convolution grid to better align with object contours, capturing subtle shape variations and improving boundary delineation and prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, DFPN leverages dense skip connections to enhance feature fusion, constructing a hierarchical structure that generates multi-resolution, high-fidelity feature maps, thus effectively detecting defects of various sizes. In addition to the model, we present a comprehensive dataset specifically curated for surface defect detection in recycled and recirculated books. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of defect types, shapes, and sizes, making it ideal for evaluating the robustness and effectiveness of defect detection models. Through extensive evaluations, DDNet achieves precise localization and classification of surface defects, recording a mAP value of 46.7% on our proprietary dataset - an improvement of 14.2% over the baseline model - demonstrating its superior detection capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyi Liu, Yeqi Luo, Weidong Yang, Jingyi Xu, Zhijun Li, Wen-Ming Chen, Ben Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning of point cloud aims to leverage unlabeled 3D data to learn meaningful representations without reliance on manual annotations. However, current approaches face challenges such as limited data diversity and inadequate augmentation for effective feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose GS-PT, which integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into point cloud self-supervised learning for the first time. Our pipeline utilizes transformers as the backbone for self-supervised pre-training and introduces novel contrastive learning tasks through 3DGS. Specifically, the transformers aim to reconstruct the masked point cloud. 3DGS utilizes multi-view rendered images as input to generate enhanced point cloud distributions and novel view images, facilitating data augmentation and cross-modal contrastive learning. Additionally, we incorporate features from depth maps. By optimizing these tasks collectively, our method enriches the tri-modal self-supervised learning process, enabling the model to leverage the correlation across 3D point clouds and 2D images from various modalities. We freeze the encoder after pre-training and test the model's performance on multiple downstream tasks. Experimental results indicate that GS-PT outperforms the off-the-shelf self-supervised learning methods on various downstream tasks including 3D object classification, real-world classifications, and few-shot learning and segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexin Fan, Kejiang Chen, Kai Zeng, Jiansong Zhang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image steganography is a technique to conceal secret messages within digital images. Steganalysis, on the contrary, aims to detect the presence of secret messages within images. Recently, deep-learning-based steganalysis methods have achieved excellent detection performance. As a countermeasure, adversarial steganography has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to effectively deceive deep-learning-based steganalysis. However, steganalysts often employ unknown steganalytic models for detection. Therefore, the ability of adversarial steganography to deceive non-target steganalytic models, known as transferability, becomes especially important. Nevertheless, existing adversarial steganographic methods do not consider how to enhance transferability. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial steganographic scheme named Natias. Specifically, we first attribute the output of a steganalytic model to each neuron in the target middle layer to identify critical features. Next, we corrupt these critical features that may be adopted by diverse steganalytic models. Consequently, it can promote the transferability of adversarial steganography. Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated with existing adversarial steganography frameworks. Thorough experimental analyses affirm that our proposed technique possesses improved transferability when contrasted with former approaches, and it attains heightened security in retraining scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Aayushman, Hemanth Gaddey, Vidhi Mittal, Manisha Chawla, Gagan Raj Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success in automating skin lesion diagnosis. However, the ethnic disparity in these models' predictions needs to be addressed before deploying them. We introduce a novel approach, PatchAlign, to enhance skin condition image classification accuracy and fairness by aligning with clinical text representations of skin conditions. PatchAlign uses Graph Optimal Transport (GOT) Loss as a regularizer to perform cross-domain alignment. The representations obtained are robust and generalize well across skin tones, even with limited training samples. To reduce the effect of noise and artifacts in clinical dermatology images, we propose a learnable Masked Graph Optimal Transport for cross-domain alignment that further improves fairness metrics.
  We compare our model to the state-of-the-art FairDisCo on two skin lesion datasets with different skin types: Fitzpatrick17k and Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI). PatchAlign enhances the accuracy of skin condition image classification by 2.8% (in-domain) and 6.2% (out-domain) on Fitzpatrick17k, and 4.2% (in-domain) on DDI compared to FairDisCo. Additionally, it consistently improves the fairness of true positive rates across skin tones.

<p>Abstract: The computational inefficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) is primarily due to the sequential updates of membrane potential, which becomes more pronounced during extended encoding periods compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). This highlights the need to parallelize SNN computations effectively to leverage available hardware parallelism.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Lin, Zhe Liu, Yongtao Wang, Le Zhang, Ce Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Perceiving the surrounding environment is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. To obtain highly accurate perception results, modern autonomous driving systems typically employ multi-modal sensors to collect comprehensive environmental data. Among these, the radar-camera multi-modal perception system is especially favored for its excellent sensing capabilities and cost-effectiveness. However, the substantial modality differences between radar and camera sensors pose challenges in fusing information. To address this problem, this paper presents RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection framework. Specifically, RCBEVDet is developed from an existing camera-based 3D object detector, supplemented by a specially designed radar feature extractor, RadarBEVNet, and a Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion (CAMF) module. Firstly, RadarBEVNet encodes sparse radar points into a dense bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature using a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross Section aware BEV encoder. Secondly, the CAMF module utilizes a deformable attention mechanism to align radar and camera BEV features and adopts channel and spatial fusion layers to fuse them. To further enhance RCBEVDet's capabilities, we introduce RCBEVDet++, which advances the CAMF through sparse fusion, supports query-based multi-view camera perception models, and adapts to a broader range of perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes show that our method integrates seamlessly with existing camera-based 3D perception models and improves their performance across various perception tasks. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results in 3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, and 3D multi-object tracking tasks. Notably, with ViT-L as the image backbone, RCBEVDet++ achieves 72.73 NDS and 67.34 mAP in 3D object detection without test-time augmentation or model ensembling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to overcome occlusions and enhance long-distance perception. Great achievements have been made in both datasets and algorithms. However, existing real-world datasets are limited by the presence of few communicable agents, while synthetic datasets typically cover only vehicles. More importantly, the penetration rate of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) , a critical factor for the deployment of cooperative perception technologies, has not been adequately addressed. To tackle these issues, we introduce Multi-V2X, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-penetration-rate dataset for V2X perception. By co-simulating SUMO and CARLA, we equip a substantial number of cars and roadside units (RSUs) in simulated towns with sensor suites, and collect comprehensive sensing data. Datasets with specified CAV penetration rates can be obtained by masking some equipped cars as normal vehicles. In total, our Multi-V2X dataset comprises 549k RGB frames, 146k LiDAR frames, and 4,219k annotated 3D bounding boxes across six categories. The highest possible CAV penetration rate reaches 86.21%, with up to 31 agents in communication range, posing new challenges in selecting agents to collaborate with.

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies raises questions about the security of machine learning models, with respect to both training-time (poisoning) and test-time (evasion, impersonation, and inversion) attacks. Models performing image-related tasks, e.g. detection, and classification, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can degrade their performance and produce undesirable outcomes. This paper introduces a novel technique for anomaly detection in images called 2DSig-Detect, which uses a 2D-signature-embedded semi-supervised framework rooted in rough path theory. We demonstrate our method in adversarial settings for training-time and test-time attacks, and benchmark our framework against other state of the art methods. Using 2DSig-Detect for anomaly detection, we show both superior performance and a reduction in the computation time to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations in images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruilin Yao, Shengwu Xiong, Yichen Zhao, Yi Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of locating objects specified by natural language expressions. Existing methods extend generic object detection frameworks to tackle this task. They typically extract visual and textual features separately using independent visual and textual encoders, then fuse these features in a multi-modal decoder for final prediction. However, visual grounding presents unique challenges. It often involves locating objects with different text descriptions within the same image. Existing methods struggle with this task because the independent visual encoder produces identical visual features for the same image, limiting detection performance. Some recently approaches propose various language-guided visual encoders to address this issue, but they mostly rely solely on textual information and require sophisticated designs. In this paper, we introduce Multi-modal Conditional Adaptation (MMCA), which enables the visual encoder to adaptively update weights, directing its focus towards text-relevant regions. Specifically, we first integrate information from different modalities to obtain multi-modal embeddings. Then we utilize a set of weighting coefficients, which generated from the multimodal embeddings, to reorganize the weight update matrices and apply them to the visual encoder of the visual grounding model. Extensive experiments on four widely used datasets demonstrate that MMCA achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art results. Ablation experiments further demonstrate the lightweight and efficiency of our method. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/Mr-Bigworth/MMCA.</p>

While toxic speech research has mainly focused on overt toxicity, such as hate speech, microaggressions in the form of PCL remain underexplored. Additionally, dominant groups' discriminatory facial expressions and attitudes toward vulnerable communities can be more impactful than verbal cues, yet these frame features are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce the PCLMM dataset, the first Chinese multimodal dataset for PCL, consisting of 715 annotated videos from Bilibili, with high-quality PCL facial frame spans. We also propose the MultiPCL detector, featuring a facial expression detection module for PCL recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of modality complementarity in this challenging task. Our work makes an important contribution to advancing microaggression detection within the domain of toxic speech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahua Dong, Yue Zhang, Qiuli Wang, Ruofeng Tong, Shihong Ying, Shaolin Gong, Xuanpu Zhang, Lanfen Lin, Yen-Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial in the field of medical imaging, aiding in disease diagnosis and surgical planning. Most established segmentation methods rely on supervised deep learning, in which clean and precise labels are essential for supervision and significantly impact the performance of models. However, manually delineated labels often contain noise, such as missing labels and inaccurate boundary delineation, which can hinder networks from correctly modeling target characteristics. In this paper, we propose a deep self-cleansing segmentation framework that can preserve clean labels while cleansing noisy ones in the training phase. To achieve this, we devise a gaussian mixture model-based label filtering module that distinguishes noisy labels from clean labels. Additionally, we develop a label cleansing module to generate pseudo low-noise labels for identified noisy samples. The preserved clean labels and pseudo-labels are then used jointly to supervise the network. Validated on a clinical liver tumor dataset and a public cardiac diagnosis dataset, our method can effectively suppress the interference from noisy labels and achieve prominent segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazheng Wang, Xiang Chen, Yuxi Zhang, Min Liu, Yaonan Wang, Hang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2024, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation balanced optimization (MCBO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the deformation field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. For preoperative medical images in different modalities, the alignment and stacking of valid information between different modalities is achieved by the maximum fusion between deformation fields. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2024, and to verify the generality of the method, we also tested it on the COMULIS3DCLEM task. Based on the results, our method achieved second place in the validation of both two tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaojie Zhang, Weijun Wang, Tianlun Huang, Zhiyong Wang, Wei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial to Partial Point Cloud Registration (partial PCR) remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with a low overlap rate. In comparison to the full-to-full registration task, we find that the objective of partial PCR is still not well-defined, indicating no metric can reliably identify the true transformation. We identify this as the most fundamental challenge in partial PCR tasks. In this paper, instead of directly seeking the optimal transformation, we propose a novel and general Sight View Constraint (SVC) to conclusively identify incorrect transformations, thereby enhancing the robustness of existing PCR methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SVC on both indoor and outdoor scenes. On the challenging 3DLoMatch dataset, our approach increases the registration recall from 78\% to 82\%, achieving the state-of-the-art result. This research also highlights the significance of the decision version problem of partial PCR, which has the potential to provide novel insights into the partial PCR problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong Zhang, Ruobing Xie, Jiansheng Chen, Xingwu Sun, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated their powerful multimodal capabilities. However, they also face serious safety problems, as adversaries can induce robustness issues in LVLMs through the use of well-designed adversarial examples. Therefore, LVLMs are in urgent need of detection tools for adversarial examples to prevent incorrect responses. In this work, we first discover that LVLMs exhibit regular attention patterns for clean images when presented with probe questions. We propose an unconventional method named PIP, which utilizes the attention patterns of one randomly selected irrelevant probe question (e.g., "Is there a clock?") to distinguish adversarial examples from clean examples. Regardless of the image to be tested and its corresponding question, PIP only needs to perform one additional inference of the image to be tested and the probe question, and then achieves successful detection of adversarial examples. Even under black-box attacks and open dataset scenarios, our PIP, coupled with a simple SVM, still achieves more than 98% recall and a precision of over 90%. Our PIP is the first attempt to detect adversarial attacks on LVLMs via simple irrelevant probe questions, shedding light on deeper understanding and introspection within LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/btzyd/pip.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate pain assessment is crucial in healthcare for effective diagnosis and treatment; however, traditional methods relying on self-reporting are inadequate for populations unable to communicate their pain. Cutting-edge AI is promising for supporting clinicians in pain recognition using facial video data. In this paper, we enhance pain recognition by employing facial video analysis within a Transformer-based deep learning model. By combining a powerful Masked Autoencoder with a Transformers-based classifier, our model effectively captures pain level indicators through both expressions and micro-expressions. We conducted our experiment on the AI4Pain dataset, which produced promising results that pave the way for innovative healthcare solutions that are both comprehensive and objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Cai, Duotun Wang, Yixun Liang, Zhijing Shao, Ying-Cong Chen, Xiaohang Zhan, Zeyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as a prevalent technique for text-to-3D generation, enabling 3D content creation by distilling view-dependent information from text-to-2D guidance. However, they frequently exhibit shortcomings such as over-saturated color and excess smoothness. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of SDS and refine its formulation, finding that the core design is to model the distribution of rendered images. Following this insight, we introduce a novel strategy called Variational Distribution Mapping (VDM), which expedites the distribution modeling process by regarding the rendered images as instances of degradation from diffusion-based generation. This special design enables the efficient training of variational distribution by skipping the calculations of the Jacobians in the diffusion U-Net. We also introduce timestep-dependent Distribution Coefficient Annealing (DCA) to further improve distilling precision. Leveraging VDM and DCA, we use Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation and build a text-to-3D generation framework. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the capability of VDM and DCA to generate high-fidelity and realistic assets with optimization efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Gao, Sanping Zhou, Le Wang, Nanning Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has emerged as a widely adopted technique in the field of medical image segmentation. The existing works either focuses on the construction of consistency constraints or the generation of pseudo labels to provide high-quality supervisory signals, whose main challenge mainly comes from how to keep the continuous improvement of model capabilities. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning framework, termed Progressive Mean Teachers (PMT), for medical image segmentation, whose goal is to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels by learning robust and diverse features in the training process. Specifically, our PMT employs a standard mean teacher to penalize the consistency of the current state and utilizes two sets of MT architectures for co-training. The two sets of MT architectures are individually updated for prolonged periods to maintain stable model diversity established through performance gaps generated by iteration differences. Additionally, a difference-driven alignment regularizer is employed to expedite the alignment of lagging models with the representation capabilities of leading models. Furthermore, a simple yet effective pseudo-label filtering algorithm is employed for facile evaluation of models and selection of high-fidelity pseudo-labels outputted when models are operating at high performance for co-training purposes. Experimental results on two datasets with different modalities, i.e., CT and MRI, demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches across various dimensions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Sheng, Shuai-Shuai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, a substantial volume of document data exists in an unstructured format, encompassing Portable Document Format (PDF) files and images. Extracting information from these documents presents formidable challenges due to diverse table styles, complex forms, and the inclusion of different languages. Several open-source toolkits, such as Camelot, Plumb a PDF (pdfnumber), and Paddle Paddle Structure V2 (PP-StructureV2), have been developed to facilitate table extraction from PDFs or images. However, each toolkit has its limitations. Camelot and pdfnumber can solely extract tables from digital PDFs and cannot handle image-based PDFs and pictures. On the other hand, PP-StructureV2 can comprehensively extract image-based PDFs and tables from pictures. Nevertheless, it lacks the ability to differentiate between diverse application scenarios, such as wired tables and wireless tables, digital PDFs, and image-based PDFs. To address these issues, we have introduced the PDF table extraction (PdfTable) toolkit. This toolkit integrates numerous open-source models, including seven table recognition models, four Optical character recognition (OCR) recognition tools, and three layout analysis models. By refining the PDF table extraction process, PdfTable achieves adaptability across various application scenarios. We substantiate the efficacy of the PdfTable toolkit through verification on a self-labeled wired table dataset and the open-source wireless Publicly Table Reconition Dataset (PubTabNet).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Horatiu Florea, Sergiu Nedevschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial scene understanding systems face stringent payload restrictions and must often rely on monocular depth estimation for modelling scene geometry, which is an inherently ill-posed problem. Moreover, obtaining accurate ground truth data required by learning-based methods raises significant additional challenges in the aerial domain. Self-supervised approaches can bypass this problem, at the cost of providing only up-to-scale results. Similarly, recent supervised solutions which make good progress towards zero-shot generalization also provide only relative depth values. This work presents TanDepth, a practical, online scale recovery method for obtaining metric depth results from relative estimations at inference-time, irrespective of the type of model generating them. Tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, our method leverages sparse measurements from Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEM) by projecting them to the camera view using extrinsic and intrinsic information. An adaptation to the Cloth Simulation Filter is presented, which allows selecting ground points from the estimated depth map to then correlate with the projected reference points. We evaluate and compare our method against alternate scaling methods adapted for UAVs, on a variety of real-world scenes. Considering the limited availability of data for this domain, we construct and release a comprehensive, depth-focused extension to the popular UAVid dataset to further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of computer vision, dynamic 3D reconstruction techniques have seen significant progress and found applications in various fields. However, these techniques generate large amounts of 3D data sequences, necessitating efficient storage and transmission methods. Existing 3D model compression methods primarily focus on static models and do not consider inter-frame information, limiting their ability to reduce data size. Temporal mesh compression, which has received less attention, often requires all input meshes to have the same topology, a condition rarely met in real-world applications. This research proposes a method to compress mesh sequences with arbitrary topology using temporal correspondence and mesh deformation. The method establishes temporal correspondence between consecutive frames, applies a deformation model to transform the mesh from one frame to subsequent frames, and replaces the original meshes with deformed ones if the quality meets a tolerance threshold. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of compression performance. The contributions of this paper include a geometry and motion-based model for establishing temporal correspondence between meshes, a mesh quality assessment for temporal mesh sequences, an entropy-based encoding and corner table-based method for compressing mesh sequences, and extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<p>Abstract: Image color consistency is the key problem in digital imaging consistency when creating datasets. Here, we propose an improved 3D Thin-Plate Splines (TPS3D) color correction method to be used, in conjunction with color charts (i.e. Macbeth ColorChecker) or other machine-readable patterns, to achieve image consistency by post-processing. Also, we benchmark our method against its former implementation and the alternative methods reported to date with an augmented dataset based on the Gehler's ColorChecker dataset. Benchmark includes how corrected images resemble the ground-truth images and how fast these implementations are. Results demonstrate that the TPS3D is the best candidate to achieve image consistency. Furthermore, our Smooth-TPS3D method shows equivalent results compared to the original method and reduced the 11-15% of ill-conditioned scenarios which the previous method failed to less than 1%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Smooth-TPS method is 20% faster than the original method. Finally, we discuss how different methods offer different compromises between quality, correction accuracy and computational load.</p>

<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) object detection is a challenging task due to the absence of open-set OOD data. Inspired by recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, we study the potential of generative models trained on large-scale open-set data to synthesize OOD samples, thereby enhancing OOD object detection. We introduce SyncOOD, a simple data curation method that capitalizes on the capabilities of large foundation models to automatically extract meaningful OOD data from text-to-image generative models. This offers the model access to open-world knowledge encapsulated within off-the-shelf foundation models. The synthetic OOD samples are then employed to augment the training of a lightweight, plug-and-play OOD detector, thus effectively optimizing the in-distribution (ID)/OOD decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SyncOOD significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with minimal synthetic data usage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Machine Learning (ML) methods are built-in as an important component in many smart agriculture platforms. In this paper, we explore the new combination of advanced ML methods for creating a smart agriculture platform where farmers could reach out for assistance from the public, or a closed circle of experts. Specifically, we focus on an easy way to assist the farmers in understanding plant diseases where the farmers can get help to solve the issues from the members of the community. The proposed system utilizes deep learning techniques for identifying the disease of the plant from the affected image, which acts as an initial identifier. Further, Natural Language Processing techniques are employed for ranking the solutions posted by the user community. In this paper, a message channel is built on top of Twitter, a popular social media platform to establish proper communication among farmers. Since the effect of the solutions can differ based on various other parameters, we extend the use of the concept drift approach and come up with a good solution and propose it to the farmer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hooman Ramezani, Dionne Aleman, Daniel L\'etourneau</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate lung nodule detection for computed tomography (CT) scan imagery is challenging in real-world settings due to the sparse occurrence of nodules and similarity to other anatomical structures. In a typical positive case, nodules may appear in as few as 3% of CT slices, complicating detection. To address this, we reframe the problem as an anomaly detection task, targeting rare nodule occurrences in a predominantly normal dataset. We introduce a novel solution leveraging custom data preprocessing and Deformable Detection Transformer (Deformable- DETR). A 7.5mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is utilized to combine adjacent lung slices into single images, reducing the slice count and decreasing nodule sparsity. This enhances spatial context, allowing for better differentiation between nodules and other structures such as complex vascular structures and bronchioles. Deformable-DETR is employed to detect nodules, with a custom focal loss function to better handle the imbalanced dataset. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LUNA16 dataset with an F1 score of 94.2% (95.2% recall, 93.3% precision) on a dataset sparsely populated with lung nodules that is reflective of real-world clinical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyu Fan, Pascal N. Tyrrell</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increase of computing power, machine learning models in medical imaging have been introduced to help in rending medical diagnosis and inspection, like hemophilia, a rare disorder in which blood cannot clot normally. Often, one of the bottlenecks of detecting hemophilia is the lack of data available to train the algorithm to increase the accuracy. As a possible solution, this research investigated whether introducing augmented data by data synthesis or traditional augmentation techniques can improve model accuracy, helping to diagnose the diseases. To tackle this research, features of ultrasound images were extracted by the pre-trained VGG-16, and similarities were compared by cosine similarity measure based on extracted features in different distributions among real images, synthetic images, and augmentation images (Real vs. Real, Syn vs. Syn, Real vs. Different Batches of Syn, Real vs. Augmentation Techniques). Model testing performance was investigated using EffientNet-B4 to recognize "blood" images with two augmentation methods. In addition, a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization was used to interpret the unexpected results like loss of accuracy. Synthetic and real images do not show high similarity, with a mean similarity score of 0.4737. Synthetic batch 1 dataset and images by horizontal flip are more similar to the original images. Classic augmentation techniques and data synthesis can improve model accuracy, and data by traditional augmentation techniques have a better performance than synthetic data. In addition, the Grad-CAM heatmap figured out the loss of accuracy is due to a shift in the domain. Overall, this research found that two augmentation methods, data synthesis and traditional augmentation techniques, both can improve accuracy to a certain extent to help to diagnose rare diseases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video synopsis is an efficient method for condensing surveillance videos. This technique begins with the detection and tracking of objects, followed by the creation of object tubes. These tubes consist of sequences, each containing chronologically ordered bounding boxes of a unique object. To generate a condensed video, the first step involves rearranging the object tubes to maximize the number of non-overlapping objects in each frame. Then, these tubes are stitched to a background image extracted from the source video. The lack of a standard dataset for the video synopsis task hinders the comparison of different video synopsis models. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a standard dataset, called SynoClip, designed specifically for the video synopsis task. SynoClip includes all the necessary features needed to evaluate various models directly and effectively. Additionally, this work introduces a video synopsis model, called FGS, with low computational cost. The model includes an empty-frame object detector to identify frames empty of any objects, facilitating efficient utilization of the deep object detector. Moreover, a tube grouping algorithm is proposed to maintain relationships among tubes in the synthesized video. This is followed by a greedy tube rearrangement algorithm, which efficiently determines the start time of each tube. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated using the proposed dataset.

<p>Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERCs) is a vital area within multimodal interaction research, dedicated to accurately identifying and classifying the emotions expressed by speakers throughout a conversation. Traditional ERC approaches predominantly rely on unimodal cues\-such as text, audio, or visual data\-leading to limitations in their effectiveness. These methods encounter two significant challenges: 1) Consistency in multimodal information. Before integrating various modalities, it is crucial to ensure that the data from different sources is aligned and coherent. 2) Contextual information capture. Successfully fusing multimodal features requires a keen understanding of the evolving emotional tone, especially in lengthy dialogues where emotions may shift and develop over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Mamba-enhanced Text-Audio-Video alignment network (MaTAV) for the ERC task. MaTAV is with the advantages of aligning unimodal features to ensure consistency across different modalities and handling long input sequences to better capture contextual multimodal information. The extensive experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that MaTAV significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the ERC task with a big margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancheng Huang, Yu Gao, Zequn Jie, Yujie Zhong, Xintong Han, Lin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MRStyle, a comprehensive framework that enables color style transfer using multi-modality reference, including image and text. To achieve a unified style feature space for both modalities, we first develop a neural network called IRStyle, which generates stylized 3D lookup tables for image reference. This is accomplished by integrating an interaction dual-mapping network with a combined supervised learning pipeline, resulting in three key benefits: elimination of visual artifacts, efficient handling of high-resolution images with low memory usage, and maintenance of style consistency even in situations with significant color style variations. For text reference, we align the text feature of stable diffusion priors with the style feature of our IRStyle to perform text-guided color style transfer (TRStyle). Our TRStyle method is highly efficient in both training and inference, producing notable open-set text-guided transfer results. Extensive experiments in both image and text settings demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junho Lee, Jeongwoo Shin, Seung Woo Ko, Seongsu Ha, Joonseok Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a video with $T$ frames, frame sampling is a task to select $N \ll T$ frames, so as to maximize the performance of a fixed video classifier. Not just brute-force search, but most existing methods suffer from its vast search space of $\binom{T}{N}$, especially when $N$ gets large. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective of reducing the search space from $O(T^N)$ to $O(T)$. Instead of exploring the entire $O(T^N)$ space, our proposed semi-optimal policy selects the top $N$ frames based on the independently estimated value of each frame using per-frame confidence, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We verify that our semi-optimal policy can efficiently approximate the optimal policy, particularly under practical settings. Additionally, through extensive experiments on various datasets and model architectures, we demonstrate that learning our semi-optimal policy ensures stable and high performance regardless of the size of $N$ and $T$.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05277">Disentangled Representations for Short-Term and Long-Term Person Re-Identification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanho Eom, Wonkyung Lee, Geon Lee, Bumsub Ham</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of person re-identification (reID), that is, retrieving person images from a large dataset, given a query image of the person of interest. A key challenge is to learn person representations robust to intra-class variations, as different persons could have the same attribute, and persons' appearances look different, e.g., with viewpoint changes. Recent reID methods focus on learning person features discriminative only for a particular factor of variations (e.g., human pose), which also requires corresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle this problem, we propose to factorize person images into identity-related and unrelated features. Identity-related features contain information useful for specifying a particular person (e.g., clothing), while identity-unrelated ones hold other factors (e.g., human pose). To this end, we propose a new generative adversarial network, dubbed identity shuffle GAN (IS-GAN). It disentangles identity-related and unrelated features from person images through an identity-shuffling technique that exploits identification labels alone without any auxiliary supervisory signals. We restrict the distribution of identity-unrelated features or encourage the identity-related and unrelated features to be uncorrelated, facilitating the disentanglement process. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of IS-GAN, showing state-of-the-art performance on standard reID benchmarks, including Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-reID. We further demonstrate the advantages of disentangling person representations on a long-term reID task, setting a new state of the art on a Celeb-reID dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsuk Choi, Hiroshi Ishikawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding neural representations of visual stimuli from electroencephalography (EEG) offers valuable insights into brain activity and cognition. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the field of visual decoding of EEG, primarily focusing on reconstructing the semantic content of visual stimuli. In this paper, we present a novel visual decoding pipeline that, in addition to recovering the content, emphasizes the reconstruction of the style, such as color and texture, of images viewed by the subject. Unlike previous methods, this ``style-based'' approach learns in the CLIP spaces of image and text separately, facilitating a more nuanced extraction of information from EEG signals. We also use captions for text alignment simpler than previously employed, which we find work better. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method better preserves the style of visual stimuli and extracts more fine-grained semantic information from neural signals. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in quantitative results and sets a new state-of-the-art on the popular Brain2Image dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quoc-Bao Nguyen-Le, Tuan-Hy Le, Anh-Triet Do, Quoc-Huy Trinh</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a major global health concern, contributing significantly to global mortality. Accurately segmenting cardiac medical imaging data is crucial for reducing fatality rates associated with these conditions. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural networks, including CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches, face challenges in capturing both inter-slice connections and intra-slice details, especially in datasets featuring intricate, long-range details along the z-axis like coronary arteries. Existing methods also struggle with differentiating non-cardiac components from the myocardium, resulting in segmentation inaccuracies and the "spraying" phenomenon. To address these issues, we introduce RotCAtt-TransUNet++, a novel architecture designed for robust segmentation of intricate cardiac structures. Our approach enhances global context modeling through multiscale feature aggregation and nested skip connections in the encoder. Transformer layers facilitate capturing intra-slice interactions, while a rotatory attention mechanism handles inter-slice connectivity. A channel-wise cross-attention gate integrates multiscale information and decoder features, effectively bridging semantic gaps. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance over current methods, achieving near-perfect annotation of coronary arteries and myocardium. Ablation studies confirm that our rotatory attention mechanism significantly improves segmentation accuracy by transforming embedded vectorized patches in semantic dimensional space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zejun gu, Junxia jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip reading involves interpreting a speaker's speech by analyzing sequences of lip movements. Currently, most models regard the left and right halves of the lips as a symmetrical whole, lacking a thorough investigation of their differences. However, the left and right halves of the lips are not always symmetrical, and the subtle differences between them contain rich semantic information. In this paper, we propose a differential learning strategy with symmetric views (DLSV) to address this issue. Additionally, input images often contain a lot of redundant information unrelated to recognition results, which can degrade the model's performance. We present a redundancy-aware operation (RAO) to reduce it. Finally, to leverage the relational information between symmetric views and within each view, we further design an adaptive cross-view interaction module (ACVI). Experiments on LRW and LRW-1000 datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skeletonization is a popular shape analysis technique that models an object's interior as opposed to just its boundary. Fitting template-based skeletal models is a time-consuming process requiring much manual parameter tuning. Recently, machine learning-based methods have shown promise for generating s-reps from object boundaries. In this work, we propose a new skeletonization method which leverages graph convolutional networks to produce skeletal representations (s-reps) from dense segmentation masks. The method is evaluated on both synthetic data and real hippocampus segmentations, achieving promising results and fast inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The open world is inherently dynamic, characterized by ever-evolving concepts and distributions. Continual learning (CL) in this dynamic open-world environment presents a significant challenge in effectively generalizing to unseen test-time classes. To address this challenge, we introduce a new practical CL setting tailored for open-world visual representation learning. In this setting, subsequent data streams systematically introduce novel classes that are disjoint from those seen in previous training phases, while also remaining distinct from the unseen test classes. In response, we present Dynamic Prompt and Representation Learner (DPaRL), a simple yet effective Prompt-based CL (PCL) method. Our DPaRL learns to generate dynamic prompts for inference, as opposed to relying on a static prompt pool in previous PCL methods. In addition, DPaRL jointly learns dynamic prompt generation and discriminative representation at each training stage whereas prior PCL methods only refine the prompt learning throughout the process. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on well-established open-world image retrieval benchmarks by an average of 4.7\% improvement in Recall@1 performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolin Gou, Chuanlin Liao, Jizhe Zhou, Fengshuo Ye, Yi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, pre-trained encoders are widely used in medical image segmentation because of their ability to capture complex feature representations. However, the existing models fail to effectively utilize the rich features obtained by the pre-trained encoder, resulting in suboptimal segmentation results. In this work, a novel U-shaped model, called FIF-UNet, is proposed to address the above issue, including three plug-and-play modules. A channel spatial interaction module (CSI) is proposed to obtain informative features by establishing the interaction between encoder stages and corresponding decoder stages. A cascaded conv-SE module (CoSE) is designed to enhance the representation of critical features by adaptively assigning importance weights on different feature channels. A multi-level fusion module (MLF) is proposed to fuse the multi-scale features from the decoder stages, ensuring accurate and robust final segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the Synapse and ACDC datasets demonstrate that the proposed FIF-UNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, which achieves the highest average DICE of 86.05% and 92.58%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ICPR 2024 Competition on Safe Segmentation of Drive Scenes in Unstructured Traffic and Adverse Weather Conditions served as a rigorous platform to evaluate and benchmark state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models under challenging conditions for autonomous driving. Over several months, participants were provided with the IDD-AW dataset, consisting of 5000 high-quality RGB-NIR image pairs, each annotated at the pixel level and captured under adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, low light, and snow. A key aspect of the competition was the use and improvement of the Safe mean Intersection over Union (Safe mIoU) metric, designed to penalize unsafe incorrect predictions that could be overlooked by traditional mIoU. This innovative metric emphasized the importance of safety in developing autonomous driving systems. The competition showed significant advancements in the field, with participants demonstrating models that excelled in semantic segmentation and prioritized safety and robustness in unstructured and adverse conditions. The results of the competition set new benchmarks in the domain, highlighting the critical role of safety in deploying autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios. The contributions from this competition are expected to drive further innovation in autonomous driving technology, addressing the critical challenges of operating in diverse and unpredictable environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang-Son Vo-Thanh, Quang-Vinh Nguyen, Soo-Hyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation is a widely researched topic due to its high applicability. Reconstructing a talking face using audio significantly contributes to fields such as education, healthcare, online conversations, virtual assistants, and virtual reality. Early studies often focused solely on changing the mouth movements, which resulted in outcomes with limited practical applications. Recently, researchers have proposed a new approach of constructing the entire face, including face pose, neck, and shoulders. To achieve this, they need to generate through landmarks. However, creating stable landmarks that align well with the audio is a challenge. In this paper, we propose the KFusion of Dual-Domain model, a robust model that generates landmarks from audio. We separate the audio into two distinct domains to learn emotional information and facial context, then use a fusion mechanism based on the KAN model. Our model demonstrates high efficiency compared to recent models. This will lay the groundwork for the development of the audio-driven talking face generation problem in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Lagrangian Hashing, a representation for neural fields combining the characteristics of fast training NeRF methods that rely on Eulerian grids (i.e.~InstantNGP), with those that employ points equipped with features as a way to represent information (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting or PointNeRF). We achieve this by incorporating a point-based representation into the high-resolution layers of the hierarchical hash tables of an InstantNGP representation. As our points are equipped with a field of influence, our representation can be interpreted as a mixture of Gaussians stored within the hash table. We propose a loss that encourages the movement of our Gaussians towards regions that require more representation budget to be sufficiently well represented. Our main finding is that our representation allows the reconstruction of signals using a more compact representation without compromising quality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05336">Early-exit Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Edanur Demir, Emre Akbas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper is aimed at developing a method that reduces the computational cost of convolutional neural networks (CNN) during inference. Conventionally, the input data pass through a fixed neural network architecture. However, easy examples can be classified at early stages of processing and conventional networks do not take this into account. In this paper, we introduce 'Early-exit CNNs', EENets for short, which adapt their computational cost based on the input by stopping the inference process at certain exit locations. In EENets, there are a number of exit blocks each of which consists of a confidence branch and a softmax branch. The confidence branch computes the confidence score of exiting (i.e. stopping the inference process) at that location; while the softmax branch outputs a classification probability vector. Both branches are learnable and their parameters are separate. During training of EENets, in addition to the classical classification loss, the computational cost of inference is taken into account as well. As a result, the network adapts its many confidence branches to the inputs so that less computation is spent for easy examples. Inference works as in conventional feed-forward networks, however, when the output of a confidence branch is larger than a certain threshold, the inference stops for that specific example. The idea of EENets is applicable to available CNN architectures such as ResNets. Through comprehensive experiments on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we show that early-exit (EE) ResNets achieve similar accuracy with their non-EE versions while reducing the computational cost to 20% of the original.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Zeng, Xinyuan Chang, Xinran Liu, Zheng Pan, Xing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: High-Definition Maps (HD maps) are essential for the precise navigation and decision-making of autonomous vehicles, yet their creation and upkeep present significant cost and timeliness challenges. The online construction of HD maps using on-board sensors has emerged as a promising solution; however, these methods can be impeded by incomplete data due to occlusions and inclement weather. This paper proposes the PriorDrive framework to addresses these limitations by harnessing the power of prior maps, significantly enhancing the robustness and accuracy of online HD map construction. Our approach integrates a variety of prior maps, such as OpenStreetMap's Standard Definition Maps (SD maps), outdated HD maps from vendors, and locally constructed maps from historical vehicle data. To effectively encode this prior information into online mapping models, we introduce a Hybrid Prior Representation (HPQuery) that standardizes the representation of diverse map elements. At the core of PriorDrive is the Unified Vector Encoder (UVE), which employs a dual encoding mechanism to process vector data. The intra-vector encoder captures fine-grained local features, while the inter-vector encoder integrates global context. Furthermore, we propose a segment-level and point-level pre-training strategy that enables the UVE to learn the prior distribution of vector data, thereby improving the encoder's generalizability and performance. Through extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset, we demonstrate that PriorDrive is highly compatible with various online mapping models and substantially improves map prediction capabilities. The integration of prior maps through the PriorDrive framework offers a robust solution to the challenges of single-perception data, paving the way for more reliable autonomous vehicle navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain is one the most complex organs in the human body. Due to its complexity, classification of brain tumors still poses a significant challenge, making brain tumors a particularly serious medical issue. Techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) coupled with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have paved the way for doctors and medical institutions to classify different types of tumors. However, these techniques suffer from limitations that violate patients privacy. Federated Learning (FL) has recently been introduced to solve such an issue, but the FL itself suffers from limitations like communication costs and dependencies on model architecture, forcing all models to have identical architectures. In this paper, we propose FedBrain-Distill, an approach that leverages Knowledge Distillation (KD) in an FL setting that maintains the users privacy and ensures the independence of FL clients in terms of model architecture. FedBrain-Distill uses an ensemble of teachers that distill their knowledge to a simple student model. The evaluation of FedBrain-Distill demonstrated high-accuracy results for both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID data with substantial low communication costs on the real-world Figshare brain tumor dataset. It is worth mentioning that we used Dirichlet distribution to partition the data into IID and non-IID data. All the implementation details are accessible through our Github repository.</p>

<p>Abstract: Harnessing the robust capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for narrative generation, logical reasoning, and common-sense knowledge integration, this study delves into utilizing LLMs to enhance automated radiology report generation (R2Gen). Despite the wealth of knowledge within LLMs, efficiently triggering relevant knowledge within these large models for specific tasks like R2Gen poses a critical research challenge. This paper presents KARGEN, a Knowledge-enhanced Automated radiology Report GENeration framework based on LLMs. Utilizing a frozen LLM to generate reports, the framework integrates a knowledge graph to unlock chest disease-related knowledge within the LLM to enhance the clinical utility of generated reports. This is achieved by leveraging the knowledge graph to distill disease-related features in a designed way. Since a radiology report encompasses both normal and disease-related findings, the extracted graph-enhanced disease-related features are integrated with regional image features, attending to both aspects. We explore two fusion methods to automatically prioritize and select the most relevant features. The fused features are employed by LLM to generate reports that are more sensitive to diseases and of improved quality. Our approach demonstrates promising results on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging computer vision task, in which 2D-based anomaly detection methods have been extensively studied. However, multimodal anomaly detection based on RGB images and 3D point clouds requires further investigation. The existing methods are mainly inspired by memory bank based methods commonly used in 2D-based anomaly detection, which may cost extra memory for storing mutimodal features. In present study, a novel memoryless method MDSS is proposed for multimodal anomaly detection, which employs a light-weighted student-teacher network and a signed distance function to learn from RGB images and 3D point clouds respectively, and complements the anomaly information from the two modalities. Specifically, a student-teacher network is trained with normal RGB images and masks generated from point clouds by a dynamic loss, and the anomaly score map could be obtained from the discrepancy between the output of student and teacher. Furthermore, the signed distance function learns from normal point clouds to predict the signed distances between points and surface, and the obtained signed distances are used to generate anomaly score map. Subsequently, the anomaly score maps are aligned to generate the final anomaly score map for detection. The experimental results indicate that MDSS is comparable but more stable than the SOTA memory bank based method Shape-guided, and furthermore performs better than other baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: For audio-driven visual dubbing, it remains a considerable challenge to uphold and highlight speaker's persona while synthesizing accurate lip synchronization. Existing methods fall short of capturing speaker's unique speaking style or preserving facial details. In this paper, we present PersonaTalk, an attention-based two-stage framework, including geometry construction and face rendering, for high-fidelity and personalized visual dubbing. In the first stage, we propose a style-aware audio encoding module that injects speaking style into audio features through a cross-attention layer. The stylized audio features are then used to drive speaker's template geometry to obtain lip-synced geometries. In the second stage, a dual-attention face renderer is introduced to render textures for the target geometries. It consists of two parallel cross-attention layers, namely Lip-Attention and Face-Attention, which respectively sample textures from different reference frames to render the entire face. With our innovative design, intricate facial details can be well preserved. Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our advantages over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, lip-sync accuracy and persona preservation. Furthermore, as a person-generic framework, PersonaTalk can achieve competitive performance as state-of-the-art person-specific methods. Project Page: https://grisoon.github.io/PersonaTalk/.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05381">Boosting CLIP Adaptation for Image Quality Assessment via Meta-Prompt Learning and Gradient Regularization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Li, Zihao Huang, Runze Hu, Yan Zhang, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) remains an unresolved challenge in the field of computer vision, due to complex distortion conditions, diverse image content, and limited data availability. The existing Blind IQA (BIQA) methods heavily rely on extensive human annotations to train models, which is both labor-intensive and costly due to the demanding nature of creating IQA datasets. To mitigate the dependence on labeled samples, this paper introduces a novel Gradient-Regulated Meta-Prompt IQA Framework (GRMP-IQA). This framework aims to fast adapt the powerful visual-language pre-trained model, CLIP, to downstream IQA tasks, significantly improving accuracy in scenarios with limited data. Specifically, the GRMP-IQA comprises two key modules: Meta-Prompt Pre-training Module and Quality-Aware Gradient Regularization. The Meta Prompt Pre-training Module leverages a meta-learning paradigm to pre-train soft prompts with shared meta-knowledge across different distortions, enabling rapid adaptation to various IQA tasks. On the other hand, the Quality-Aware Gradient Regularization is designed to adjust the update gradients during fine-tuning, focusing the model's attention on quality-relevant features and preventing overfitting to semantic information. Extensive experiments on five standard BIQA datasets demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art BIQA methods under limited data setting, i.e., achieving SRCC values of 0.836 (vs. 0.760 on LIVEC) and 0.853 (vs. 0.812 on KonIQ). Notably, utilizing just 20\% of the training data, our GRMP-IQA outperforms most existing fully supervised BIQA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wu, Chengyu Pan, Yuting Yan, Guansong Pang, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to discover behaviors or events deviating from the normality in videos. As a long-standing task in the field of computer vision, VAD has witnessed much good progress. In the era of deep learning, with the explosion of architectures of continuously growing capability and capacity, a great variety of deep learning based methods are constantly emerging for the VAD task, greatly improving the generalization ability of detection algorithms and broadening the application scenarios. Therefore, such a multitude of methods and a large body of literature make a comprehensive survey a pressing necessity. In this paper, we present an extensive and comprehensive research review, covering the spectrum of five different categories, namely, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, fully supervised, unsupervised and open-set supervised VAD, and we also delve into the latest VAD works based on pre-trained large models, remedying the limitations of past reviews in terms of only focusing on semi-supervised VAD and small model based methods. For the VAD task with different levels of supervision, we construct a well-organized taxonomy, profoundly discuss the characteristics of different types of methods, and show their performance comparisons. In addition, this review involves the public datasets, open-source codes, and evaluation metrics covering all the aforementioned VAD tasks. Finally, we provide several important research directions for the VAD community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Ge, Kangkai Zhang, Haolin Liu, Yingying Hua, Shengwei Zhao, Xin Jin, Hao Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: In spite of great success in many image recognition tasks achieved by recent deep models, directly applying them to recognize low-resolution images may suffer from low accuracy due to the missing of informative details during resolution degradation. However, these images are still recognizable for subjects who are familiar with the corresponding high-resolution ones. Inspired by that, we propose a teacher-student learning approach to facilitate low-resolution image recognition via hybrid order relational knowledge distillation. The approach refers to three streams: the teacher stream is pretrained to recognize high-resolution images in high accuracy, the student stream is learned to identify low-resolution images by mimicking the teacher's behaviors, and the extra assistant stream is introduced as bridge to help knowledge transfer across the teacher to the student. To extract sufficient knowledge for reducing the loss in accuracy, the learning of student is supervised with multiple losses, which preserves the similarities in various order relational structures. In this way, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution images can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on metric learning, low-resolution image classification and low-resolution face recognition tasks show the effectiveness of our approach, while taking reduced models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangjun Tang, Linjun Wu, He Wang, Yiqian Wu, Bo Hu, Songnan Li, Xu Gong, Yuchen Liao, Qilong Kou, Xiaogang Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion style transfer changes the style of a motion while retaining its content and is useful in computer animations and games. Contact is an essential component of motion style transfer that should be controlled explicitly in order to express the style vividly while enhancing motion naturalness and quality. However, it is unknown how to decouple and control contact to achieve fine-grained control in motion style transfer. In this paper, we present a novel style transfer method for fine-grained control over contacts while achieving both motion naturalness and spatial-temporal variations of style. Based on our empirical evidence, we propose controlling contact indirectly through the hip velocity, which can be further decomposed into the trajectory and contact timing, respectively. To this end, we propose a new model that explicitly models the correlations between motions and trajectory/contact timing/style, allowing us to decouple and control each separately. Our approach is built around a motion manifold, where hip controls can be easily integrated into a Transformer-based decoder. It is versatile in that it can generate motions directly as well as be used as post-processing for existing methods to improve quality and contact controllability. In addition, we propose a new metric that measures a correlation pattern of motions based on our empirical evidence, aligning well with human perception in terms of motion naturalness. Based on extensive evaluation, our method outperforms existing methods in terms of style expressivity and motion quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Ye, Chengyu Tao, Juan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: There are a variety of industrial products that possess periodic textures or surfaces, such as carbon fiber textiles and display panels. Traditional image-based quality inspection methods for these products require identifying the periodic patterns from normal images (without anomaly and noise) and subsequently detecting anomaly pixels with inconsistent appearances. However, it remains challenging to accurately extract the periodic pattern from a single image in the presence of unknown anomalies and measurement noise. To deal with this challenge, this paper proposes a novel self-representation of the periodic image defined on a set of continuous parameters. In this way, periodic pattern learning can be embedded into a joint optimization framework, which is named periodic-sparse decomposition, with simultaneously modeling the sparse anomalies and Gaussian noise. Finally, for the real-world industrial images that may not strictly satisfy the periodic assumption, we propose a novel pixel-level anomaly scoring strategy to enhance the performance of anomaly detection. Both simulated and real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for periodic pattern learning and anomaly detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05393">TAVP: Task-Adaptive Visual Prompt for Cross-domain Few-shot Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Yang, Ye Huang, Xiangjian He, Linlin Shen, Guoping Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Under the backdrop of large-scale pre-training, large visual models (LVM) have demonstrated significant potential in image understanding. The recent emergence of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has brought a qualitative shift in the field of image segmentation, supporting flexible interactive cues and strong learning capabilities. However, its performance often falls short in cross-domain and few-shot applications. Transferring prior knowledge from foundation models to new applications while preserving learning capabilities is worth exploring. This work proposes a task-adaptive prompt framework based on SAM, a new paradigm for Cross-dominan few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS). First, a Multi-level Feature Fusion (MFF) was used for integrated feature extraction. Besides, an additional Class Domain Task-Adaptive Auto-Prompt (CDTAP) module was combined with the segmentation branch for class-domain agnostic feature extraction and high-quality learnable prompt production. This significant advancement uses a unique generative approach to prompts alongside a comprehensive model structure and specialized prototype computation. While ensuring that the prior knowledge of SAM is not discarded, the new branch disentangles category and domain information through prototypes, guiding it in adapting the CD-FSS. We have achieved the best results on three benchmarks compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Comprehensive experiments showed that after task-specific and weighted guidance, the abundant feature information of SAM can be better learned for CD-FSS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Pantazopoulos, Malvina Nikandrou, Alessandro Suglia, Oliver Lemon, Arash Eshghi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores replacing Transformers in Visual Language Models (VLMs) with Mamba, a recent structured state space model (SSM) that demonstrates promising performance in sequence modeling. We test models up to 3B parameters under controlled conditions, showing that Mamba-based VLMs outperforms Transformers-based VLMs in captioning, question answering, and reading comprehension. However, we find that Transformers achieve greater performance in visual grounding and the performance gap widens with scale. We explore two hypotheses to explain this phenomenon: 1) the effect of task-agnostic visual encoding on the updates of the hidden states, and 2) the difficulty in performing visual grounding from the perspective of in-context multimodal retrieval. Our results indicate that a task-aware encoding yields minimal performance gains on grounding, however, Transformers significantly outperform Mamba at in-context multimodal retrieval. Overall, Mamba shows promising performance on tasks where the correct output relies on a summary of the image but struggles when retrieval of explicit information from the context is required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhi Lu, Ruian He, Shili Zhou, Weimin Tan, Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial movements play a crucial role in conveying altitude and intentions, and facial optical flow provides a dynamic and detailed representation of it. However, the scarcity of datasets and a modern baseline hinders the progress in facial optical flow research. This paper proposes FacialFlowNet (FFN), a novel large-scale facial optical flow dataset, and the Decomposed Facial Flow Model (DecFlow), the first method capable of decomposing facial flow. FFN comprises 9,635 identities and 105,970 image pairs, offering unprecedented diversity for detailed facial and head motion analysis. DecFlow features a facial semantic-aware encoder and a decomposed flow decoder, excelling in accurately estimating and decomposing facial flow into head and expression components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FFN significantly enhances the accuracy of facial flow estimation across various optical flow methods, achieving up to an 11% reduction in Endpoint Error (EPE) (from 3.91 to 3.48). Moreover, DecFlow, when coupled with FFN, outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, enhancing facial expression analysis. The decomposed expression flow achieves a substantial accuracy improvement of 18% (from 69.1% to 82.1%) in micro-expressions recognition. These contributions represent a significant advancement in facial motion analysis and optical flow estimation. Codes and datasets can be found.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan S. W. Stevens, Ois\'in Nolan, Jean-Luc Robert, Ruud J. G. van Sloun</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly risen in popularity for their ability to model complex distributions and perform effective posterior sampling. Unfortunately, the iterative nature of these generative models makes them computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time sequential inverse problems such as ultrasound imaging. Considering the strong temporal structure across sequences of frames, we propose a novel approach that models the transition dynamics to improve the efficiency of sequential diffusion posterior sampling in conditional image synthesis. Through modeling sequence data using a video vision transformer (ViViT) transition model based on previous diffusion outputs, we can initialize the reverse diffusion trajectory at a lower noise scale, greatly reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world dataset of high frame rate cardiac ultrasound images and show that it achieves the same performance as a full diffusion trajectory while accelerating inference 25$\times$, enabling real-time posterior sampling. Furthermore, we show that the addition of a transition model improves the PSNR up to 8\% in cases with severe motion. Our method opens up new possibilities for real-time applications of diffusion models in imaging and other domains requiring real-time inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Di Nucci, Alessandro Simoni, Matteo Tomei, Luca Ciuffreda, Roberto Vezzani, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: The three-dimensional representation of objects or scenes starting from a set of images has been a widely discussed topic for years and has gained additional attention after the diffusion of NeRF-based approaches. However, an underestimated prerequisite is the knowledge of camera poses or, more specifically, the estimation of the extrinsic calibration parameters. Although excellent general-purpose Structure-from-Motion methods are available as a pre-processing step, their computational load is high and they require a lot of frames to guarantee sufficient overlapping among the views. This paper introduces KRONC, a novel approach aimed at inferring view poses by leveraging prior knowledge about the object to reconstruct and its representation through semantic keypoints. With a focus on vehicle scenes, KRONC is able to estimate the position of the views as a solution to a light optimization problem targeting the convergence of keypoints' back-projections to a singular point. To validate the method, a specific dataset of real-world car scenes has been collected. Experiments confirm KRONC's ability to generate excellent estimates of camera poses starting from very coarse initialization. Results are comparable with Structure-from-Motion methods with huge savings in computation. Code and data will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tessa Pulli, Stefan Thalhammer, Simon Schwaiger, Markus Vincze</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots are increasingly envisioned to interact in real-world scenarios, where they must continuously adapt to new situations. To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asim Naveed, Syed S. Naqvi, Tariq M. Khan, Shahzaib Iqbal, M. Yaqoob Wani, Haroon Ahmed Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer-aided diagnosis tools employed for skin cancer treatment and early diagnosis, skin lesion segmentation is important. However, achieving precise segmentation is challenging due to inherent variations in appearance, contrast, texture, and blurry lesion boundaries. This research presents a robust approach utilizing a dilated convolutional residual network, which incorporates an attention-based spatial feature enhancement block (ASFEB) and employs a guided decoder strategy. In each dilated convolutional residual block, dilated convolution is employed to broaden the receptive field with varying dilation rates. To improve the spatial feature information of the encoder, we employed an attention-based spatial feature enhancement block in the skip connections. The ASFEB in our proposed method combines feature maps obtained from average and maximum-pooling operations. These combined features are then weighted using the active outcome of global average pooling and convolution operations. Additionally, we have incorporated a guided decoder strategy, where each decoder block is optimized using an individual loss function to enhance the feature learning process in the proposed AD-Net. The proposed AD-Net presents a significant benefit by necessitating fewer model parameters compared to its peer methods. This reduction in parameters directly impacts the number of labeled data required for training, facilitating faster convergence during the training process. The effectiveness of the proposed AD-Net was evaluated using four public benchmark datasets. We conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to verify the efficiency of the AD-Net. The outcomes suggest that our method surpasses other cutting-edge methods in performance, even without the implementation of data augmentation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huang-Yu Chen, Jia-Fong Yeh, Jia-Wei Liao, Pin-Hsuan Peng, Winston H. Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical technology for the development of autonomous driving and robotics. However, the high cost of data annotation limits its advancement. We propose a novel and effective active learning (AL) method called Distribution Discrepancy and Feature Heterogeneity (DDFH), which simultaneously considers geometric features and model embeddings, assessing information from both the instance-level and frame-level perspectives. Distribution Discrepancy evaluates the difference and novelty of instances within the unlabeled and labeled distributions, enabling the model to learn efficiently with limited data. Feature Heterogeneity ensures the heterogeneity of intra-frame instance features, maintaining feature diversity while avoiding redundant or similar instances, thus minimizing annotation costs. Finally, multiple indicators are efficiently aggregated using Quantile Transform, providing a unified measure of informativeness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDFH outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, effectively reducing the bounding box annotation cost by 56.3% and showing robustness when working with both one-stage and two-stage models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang Tu, Hao Fu, Fengyu Yang, Hanbin Zhao, Chao Zhang, Hui Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile sensation plays a crucial role in the development of multi-modal large models and embodied intelligence. To collect tactile data with minimal cost as possible, a series of studies have attempted to generate tactile images by vision-to-touch image translation. However, compared to text modality, visual modality-driven tactile generation cannot accurately depict human tactile sensation. In this work, we analyze the characteristics of tactile images in detail from two granularities: object-level (tactile texture, tactile shape), and sensor-level (gel status). We model these granularities of information through text descriptions and propose a fine-grained Text-to-Touch generation method (TextToucher) to generate high-quality tactile samples. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal large language model to build the text sentences about object-level tactile information and employ a set of learnable text prompts to represent the sensor-level tactile information. To better guide the tactile generation process with the built text information, we fuse the dual grains of text information and explore various dual-grain text conditioning methods within the diffusion transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a Contrastive Text-Touch Pre-training (CTTP) metric to precisely evaluate the quality of text-driven generated tactile data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our TextToucher method. The source codes will be available at \url{https://github.com/TtuHamg/TextToucher}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyao Tian, Zhen Chen, Huai Liao, Xinyan Huang, Lujie Li, Sebastien Ourselin, Hongbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image depth estimation is essential for endoscopy tasks such as localization, reconstruction, and augmented reality. Most existing methods in surgical scenes focus on in-domain depth estimation, limiting their real-world applicability. This constraint stems from the scarcity and inferior labeling quality of medical data for training. In this work, we present EndoOmni, the first foundation model for zero-shot cross-domain depth estimation for endoscopy. To harness the potential of diverse training data, we refine the advanced self-learning paradigm that employs a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels, guiding a student model trained on large-scale labeled and unlabeled data. To address training disturbance caused by inherent noise in depth labels, we propose a robust training framework that leverages both depth labels and estimated confidence from the teacher model to jointly guide the student model training. Moreover, we propose a weighted scale-and-shift invariant loss to adaptively adjust learning weights based on label confidence, thus imposing learning bias towards cleaner label pixels while reducing the influence of highly noisy pixels. Experiments on zero-shot relative depth estimation show that our EndoOmni improves state-of-the-art methods in medical imaging for 41\% and existing foundation models for 25\% in terms of absolute relative error on specific dataset. Furthermore, our model provides strong initialization for fine-tuning to metric depth estimation, maintaining superior performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have provided promising solutions for synthesizing realistic driving videos, which are crucial for training autonomous driving perception models. However, existing approaches often struggle with multi-view video generation due to the challenges of integrating 3D information while maintaining spatial-temporal consistency and effectively learning from a unified model. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework named DriveScape for multi-view, 3D condition-guided video generation. DriveScape not only streamlines the process by integrating camera data to ensure comprehensive spatial-temporal coverage, but also introduces a Bi-Directional Modulated Transformer module to effectively align 3D road structural information. As a result, our approach enables precise control over video generation, significantly enhancing realism and providing a robust solution for generating multi-view driving videos. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating impressive generative quality metrics with an FID score of 8.34 and an FVD score of 76.39, as well as superior performance across various perception tasks. This paves the way for more accurate environmental simulations in autonomous driving. Code will be available at our project homepage.</p>

<p>Abstract: The limited training samples for object detectors commonly result in low accuracy out-of-distribution (OOD) object detection. We have observed that feature vectors of the same class tend to cluster tightly in feature space, whereas those of different classes are more scattered. This insight motivates us to leverage feature similarity for OOD detection. Drawing on the concept of prototypes prevalent in few-shot learning, we introduce a novel network architecture, Proto-OOD, designed for this purpose. Proto-OOD enhances prototype representativeness through contrastive loss and identifies OOD data by assessing the similarity between input features and prototypes. It employs a negative embedding generator to create negative embedding, which are then used to train the similarity module. Proto-OOD achieves significantly lower FPR95 in MS-COCO dataset and higher mAP for Pascal VOC dataset, when utilizing Pascal VOC as ID dataset and MS-COCO as OOD dataset. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics and propose an enhanced evaluation protocol.</p>

A few pioneering works have sought to tackle the challenge of sparse-view reconstruction by leveraging additional geometric priors or multi-scene generalizability. However, they are still hindered by the imperfect choice of input views, using images under empirically determined viewpoints to provide considerable overlap. We propose PVP-Recon, a novel and effective sparse-view surface reconstruction method that progressively plans the next best views to form an optimal set of sparse viewpoints for image capturing. PVP-Recon starts initial surface reconstruction with as few as 3 views and progressively adds new views which are determined based on a novel warping score that reflects the information gain of each newly added view. This progressive view planning progress is interleaved with a neural SDF-based reconstruction module that utilizes multi-resolution hash features, enhanced by a progressive training scheme and a directional Hessian loss. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our framework achieves high-quality reconstruction with a constrained input budget and outperforms existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Mukherjee, Yash Dixit, Naman Srivastava, Joel D Joy, Rohan Olikara, Koesha Sinha, Swarup E, Rakshit Ramesh</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of fine-scale multispectral imagery with deep learning models has revolutionized land use and land cover (LULC) classification. However, the atmospheric effects present in Top-of-Atmosphere sensor measured Digital Number values must be corrected to retrieve accurate Bottom-of-Atmosphere surface reflectance for reliable analysis. This study employs look-up-table-based radiative transfer simulations to estimate the atmospheric path reflectance and transmittance for atmospherically correcting high-resolution CARTOSAT-3 Multispectral (MX) imagery for several Indian cities. The corrected surface reflectance data were subsequently used in supervised and semi-supervised segmentation models, demonstrating stability in multi-class (buildings, roads, trees and water bodies) LULC segmentation accuracy, particularly in scenarios with sparsely labelled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianbo Ma, Kousuke Imamura, Ziyan Gao, Xiangjie Wang, Satoshi Yamane</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a fundamental and long-standing visual task. In this work, we present a novel method, dubbed HMAFlow, to improve optical flow estimation in these tough scenes, especially with small objects. The proposed model mainly consists of two core components: a Hierarchical Motion Field Alignment (HMA) module and a Correlation Self-Attention (CSA) module. In addition, we rebuild 4D cost volumes by employing a Multi-Scale Correlation Search (MCS) layer and replacing average pooling in common cost volumes with an search strategy using multiple search ranges. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the best generalization performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, compared with RAFT, our method achieves relative error reductions of 14.2% and 3.4% on the clean pass and final pass of the Sintel online benchmark, respectively. On the KITTI test benchmark, HMAFlow surpasses RAFT and GMA in the Fl-all metric by a relative margin of 6.8% and 7.7%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongkuo Min, Yixuan Gao, Yuqin Cao, Guangtao Zhai, Wenjun Zhang, Huifang Sun, Chang Wen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional in the wild image quality assessment (IQA) models are generally trained with the quality labels of mean opinion score (MOS), while missing the rich subjective quality information contained in the quality ratings, for example, the standard deviation of opinion scores (SOS) or even distribution of opinion scores (DOS). In this paper, we propose a novel IQA method named RichIQA to explore the rich subjective rating information beyond MOS to predict image quality in the wild. RichIQA is characterized by two key novel designs: (1) a three-stage image quality prediction network which exploits the powerful feature representation capability of the Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) and mimics the short-term and long-term memory mechanisms of human brain; (2) a multi-label training strategy in which rich subjective quality information like MOS, SOS and DOS are concurrently used to train the quality prediction network. Powered by these two novel designs, RichIQA is able to predict the image quality in terms of a distribution, from which the mean image quality can be subsequently obtained. Extensive experimental results verify that the three-stage network is tailored to predict rich quality information, while the multi-label training strategy can fully exploit the potentials within subjective quality rating and enhance the prediction performance and generalizability of the network. RichIQA outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on multiple large-scale in the wild IQA databases with rich subjective rating labels. The code of RichIQA will be made publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuesong Zhang, Jia Li, Yunbo Xu, Zhenzhen Hu, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous navigation for an embodied agent guided by natural language instructions remains a formidable challenge in vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Despite remarkable recent progress in learning fine-grained and multifarious visual representations, the tendency to overfit to the training environments leads to unsatisfactory generalization performance. In this work, we present a versatile Multi-Branch Architecture (MBA) aimed at exploring and exploiting diverse visual inputs. Specifically, we introduce three distinct visual variants: ground-truth depth images, visual inputs integrated with incongruent views, and those infused with random noise to enrich the diversity of visual input representation and prevent overfitting to the original RGB observations. To adaptively fuse these varied inputs, the proposed MBA extend a base agent model into a multi-branch variant, where each branch processes a different visual input. Surprisingly, even random noise can further enhance navigation performance in unseen environments. Extensive experiments conducted on three VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON) demonstrate that our proposed method equals or even surpasses state-of-the-art results. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahya Jabary, Andreas Plesner, Turlan Kuzhagaliyev, Roger Wattenhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern CAPTCHAs rely heavily on vision tasks that are supposedly hard for computers but easy for humans. However, advances in image recognition models pose a significant threat to such CAPTCHAs. These models can easily be fooled by generating some well-hidden "random" noise and adding it to the image, or hiding objects in the image. However, these methods are model-specific and thus can not aid CAPTCHAs in fooling all models. We show in this work that by allowing for more significant changes to the images while preserving the semantic information and keeping it solvable by humans, we can fool many state-of-the-art models. Specifically, we demonstrate that by adding masks of various intensities the Accuracy @ 1 (Acc@1) drops by more than 50%-points for all models, and supposedly robust models such as vision transformers see an Acc@1 drop of 80%-points.
  These masks can therefore effectively fool modern image classifiers, thus showing that machines have not caught up with humans -- yet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Palmer, Martin Kr\"uger, Stefan Sch\"utte, Richard Altendorfer, Ganesh Adam, Torsten Bertram</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is vital for automated driving. While lidar sensors are well suited for this task, they are expensive and have limitations in adverse weather conditions. 3+1D imaging radar sensors offer a cost-effective, robust alternative but face challenges due to their low resolution and high measurement noise. Existing 3+1D imaging radar datasets include radar and lidar data, enabling cross-modal model improvements. Although lidar should not be used during inference, it can aid the training of radar-only object detectors. We explore two strategies to transfer knowledge from the lidar to the radar domain and radar-only object detectors: 1. multi-stage training with sequential lidar point cloud thin-out, and 2. cross-modal knowledge distillation. In the multi-stage process, three thin-out methods are examined. Our results show significant performance gains of up to 4.2 percentage points in mean Average Precision with multi-stage training and up to 3.9 percentage points with knowledge distillation by initializing the student with the teacher's weights. The main benefit of these approaches is their applicability to other 3D object detection networks without altering their architecture, as we show by analyzing it on two different object detectors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Peng, Tian Xia, Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro, Tomas Bosschieter, Ehsan Adeli, Qingyu Zhao, Ben Glocker, Kilian M. Pohl</p>
<p>Abstract: The number of samples in structural brain MRI studies is often too small to properly train deep learning models. Generative models show promise in addressing this issue by effectively learning the data distribution and generating high-fidelity MRI. However, they struggle to produce diverse, high-quality data outside the distribution defined by the training data. One way to address the issue is using causal models developed for 3D volume counterfactuals. However, accurately modeling causality in high-dimensional spaces is a challenge so that these models generally generate 3D brain MRIS of lower quality. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage method that constructs a Structural Causal Model (SCM) within the latent space. In the first stage, we employ a VQ-VAE to learn a compact embedding of the MRI volume. Subsequently, we integrate our causal model into this latent space and execute a three-step counterfactual procedure using a closed-form Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Our experiments conducted on real-world high-resolution MRI data (1mm) demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality 3D MRI counterfactuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhou Chen, Zirui Zhang, Jing Yu, Heqiang Huang, Ronghui Zhang, Xuemiao Xu, Bin Sheng, Hong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Driver distraction remains a leading cause of traffic accidents, posing a critical threat to road safety globally. As intelligent transportation systems evolve, accurate and real-time identification of driver distraction has become essential. However, existing methods struggle to capture both global contextual and fine-grained local features while contending with noisy labels in training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose DSDFormer, a novel framework that integrates the strengths of Transformer and Mamba architectures through a Dual State Domain Attention (DSDA) mechanism, enabling a balance between long-range dependencies and detailed feature extraction for robust driver behavior recognition. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Reasoning Confident Learning (TRCL), an unsupervised approach that refines noisy labels by leveraging spatiotemporal correlations in video sequences. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AUC-V1, AUC-V2, and 100-Driver datasets and demonstrates real-time processing efficiency on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin platform. Extensive experimental results confirm that DSDFormer and TRCL significantly improve both the accuracy and robustness of driver distraction detection, offering a scalable solution to enhance road safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhang, Raghavendra Ramachandra, Kiran Raja, Christoph Busch</p>
<p>Abstract: Face morphing attack detection (MAD) algorithms have become essential to overcome the vulnerability of face recognition systems. To solve the lack of large-scale and public-available datasets due to privacy concerns and restrictions, in this work we propose a new method to generate a synthetic face morphing dataset with 2450 identities and more than 100k morphs. The proposed synthetic face morphing dataset is unique for its high-quality samples, different types of morphing algorithms, and the generalization for both single and differential morphing attack detection algorithms. For experiments, we apply face image quality assessment and vulnerability analysis to evaluate the proposed synthetic face morphing dataset from the perspective of biometric sample quality and morphing attack potential on face recognition systems. The results are benchmarked with an existing SOTA synthetic dataset and a representative non-synthetic and indicate improvement compared with the SOTA. Additionally, we design different protocols and study the applicability of using the proposed synthetic dataset on training morphing attack detection algorithms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05606">CustomContrast: A Multilevel Contrastive Perspective For Subject-Driven Text-to-Image Customization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Chen, Mengqi Huang, Zhuowei Chen, Yang Zheng, Lei Zhang, Zhendong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Subject-driven text-to-image (T2I) customization has drawn significant interest in academia and industry. This task enables pre-trained models to generate novel images based on unique subjects. Existing studies adopt a self-reconstructive perspective, focusing on capturing all details of a single image, which will misconstrue the specific image's irrelevant attributes (e.g., view, pose, and background) as the subject intrinsic attributes. This misconstruction leads to both overfitting or underfitting of irrelevant and intrinsic attributes of the subject, i.e., these attributes are over-represented or under-represented simultaneously, causing a trade-off between similarity and controllability. In this study, we argue an ideal subject representation can be achieved by a cross-differential perspective, i.e., decoupling subject intrinsic attributes from irrelevant attributes via contrastive learning, which allows the model to focus more on intrinsic attributes through intra-consistency (features of the same subject are spatially closer) and inter-distinctiveness (features of different subjects have distinguished differences). Specifically, we propose CustomContrast, a novel framework, which includes a Multilevel Contrastive Learning (MCL) paradigm and a Multimodal Feature Injection (MFI) Encoder. The MCL paradigm is used to extract intrinsic features of subjects from high-level semantics to low-level appearance through crossmodal semantic contrastive learning and multiscale appearance contrastive learning. To facilitate contrastive learning, we introduce the MFI encoder to capture cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of CustomContrast in subject similarity and text controllability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05611">Adapted-MoE: Mixture of Experts with Test-Time Adaption for Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwu Lei, Silin Chen, Bohan Wang, Zhengkai Jiang, Ningmu Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Most unsupervised anomaly detection methods based on representations of normal samples to distinguish anomalies have recently made remarkable progress. However, existing methods only learn a single decision boundary for distinguishing the samples within the training dataset, neglecting the variation in feature distribution for normal samples even in the same category in the real world. Furthermore, it was not considered that a distribution bias still exists between the test set and the train set. Therefore, we propose an Adapted-MoE which contains a routing network and a series of expert models to handle multiple distributions of same-category samples by divide and conquer. Specifically, we propose a routing network based on representation learning to route same-category samples into the subclasses feature space. Then, a series of expert models are utilized to learn the representation of various normal samples and construct several independent decision boundaries. We propose the test-time adaption to eliminate the bias between the unseen test sample representation and the feature distribution learned by the expert model. Our experiments are conducted on a dataset that provides multiple subclasses from three categories, namely Texture AD benchmark. The Adapted-MoE significantly improves the performance of the baseline model, achieving 2.18%-7.20% and 1.57%-16.30% increase in I-AUROC and P-AUROC, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lutao Jiang, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the burgeoning interest in implicit neural representation, Neural Light Field (NeLF) has been introduced to predict the color of a ray directly. Unlike Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), NeLF does not create a point-wise representation by predicting color and volume density for each point in space. However, the current NeLF methods face a challenge as they need to train a NeRF model first and then synthesize over 10K views to train NeLF for improved performance. Additionally, the rendering quality of NeLF methods is lower compared to NeRF methods. In this paper, we propose G-NeLF, a versatile grid-based NeLF approach that utilizes spatial-aware features to unleash the potential of the neural network's inference capability, and consequently overcome the difficulties of NeLF training. Specifically, we employ a spatial-aware feature sequence derived from a meticulously crafted grid as the ray's representation. Drawing from our empirical studies on the adaptability of multi-resolution hash tables, we introduce a novel grid-based ray representation for NeLF that can represent the entire space with a very limited number of parameters. To better utilize the sequence feature, we design a lightweight ray color decoder that simulates the ray propagation process, enabling a more efficient inference of the ray's color. G-NeLF can be trained without necessitating significant storage overhead and with the model size of only 0.95 MB to surpass previous state-of-the-art NeLF. Moreover, compared with grid-based NeRF methods, e.g., Instant-NGP, we only utilize one-tenth of its parameters to achieve higher performance. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Lingling Li, Licheng Jiao, Xu Liu, Fang Liu, Shuyuan Yang, Biao Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite imagery, due to its long-range imaging, brings with it a variety of scale-preferred tasks, such as the detection of tiny/small objects, making the precise localization and detection of small objects of interest a challenging task. In this article, we design a Knowledge Discovery Network (KDN) to implement the renormalization group theory in terms of efficient feature extraction. Renormalized connection (RC) on the KDN enables ``synergistic focusing'' of multi-scale features. Based on our observations of KDN, we abstract a class of RCs with different connection strengths, called n21C, and generalize it to FPN-based multi-branch detectors. In a series of FPN experiments on the scale-preferred tasks, we found that the ``divide-and-conquer'' idea of FPN severely hampers the detector's learning in the right direction due to the large number of large-scale negative samples and interference from background noise. Moreover, these negative samples cannot be eliminated by the focal loss function. The RCs extends the multi-level feature's ``divide-and-conquer'' mechanism of the FPN-based detectors to a wide range of scale-preferred tasks, and enables synergistic effects of multi-level features on the specific learning goal. In addition, interference activations in two aspects are greatly reduced and the detector learns in a more correct direction. Extensive experiments of 17 well-designed detection architectures embedded with n21s on five different levels of scale-preferred tasks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the RCs. Especially the simplest linear form of RC, E421C performs well in all tasks and it satisfies the scaling property of RGT. We hope that our approach will transfer a large number of well-designed detectors from the computer vision community to the remote sensing community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating forest biomass is crucial for global carbon cycle modelling and climate change mitigation. Tree height, a key factor in biomass calculations, can be measured using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology. This study applies machine learning to extract forest height data from two SAR products: Single Look Complex (SLC) images and tomographic cubes, in preparation for the ESA Biomass Satellite mission. We use the TomoSense dataset, containing SAR and LiDAR data from Germany's Eifel National Park, to develop and evaluate height estimation models. Our approach includes classical methods, deep learning with a 3D U-Net, and Bayesian-optimized techniques. By testing various SAR frequencies and polarimetries, we establish a baseline for future height and biomass modelling. Best-performing models predict forest height to be within 2.82m mean absolute error for canopies around 30m, advancing our ability to measure global carbon stocks and support climate action.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Li, Zhen Qiu, Yilin Yang, Yuqi Li, Zeyu Dong, Chuanguang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary challenges in visible-infrared person re-identification arise from the differences between visible (vis) and infrared (ir) images, including inter-modal and intra-modal variations. These challenges are further complicated by varying viewpoints and irregular movements. Existing methods often rely on horizontal partitioning to align part-level features, which can introduce inaccuracies and have limited effectiveness in reducing modality discrepancies. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-Driven Multi-feature generation framework (PDM) aimed at mitigating cross-modal discrepancies by constructing diversified features and mining latent semantically similar features for modal alignment. PDM comprises two key components: Multi-Feature Generation Module (MFGM) and Prototype Learning Module (PLM). The MFGM generates diversity features closely distributed from modality-shared features to represent pedestrians. Additionally, the PLM utilizes learnable prototypes to excavate latent semantic similarities among local features between visible and infrared modalities, thereby facilitating cross-modal instance-level alignment. We introduce the cosine heterogeneity loss to enhance prototype diversity for extracting rich local features. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and LLCM datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo De Monte, Davide Dalle Pezze, Marina Ceccon, Francesco Pasti, Francesco Paissan, Elisabetta Farella, Gian Antonio Susto, Nicola Bellotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Object Detection is a highly relevant computer vision problem with many applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Continual Learning~(CL) considers a setting where a model incrementally learns new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge. This is particularly challenging since Deep Learning models tend to catastrophically forget old knowledge while training on new data. In particular, Continual Learning for Object Detection~(CLOD) poses additional difficulties compared to CL for Classification. In CLOD, images from previous tasks may contain unknown classes that could reappear labeled in future tasks. These missing annotations cause task interference issues for replay-based approaches. As a result, most works in the literature have focused on distillation-based approaches. However, these approaches are effective only when there is a strong overlap of classes across tasks. To address the issues of current methodologies, we propose a novel technique to solve CLOD called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). Based on the replay method, our solution avoids task interference issues by enhancing the buffer memory samples. Our method is evaluated against existing techniques in CLOD literature, demonstrating its superior performance on established benchmarks like VOC and COCO.</p>

However, due to the complexity of the computation pipeline, running HAR on live video streams incurs excessive delays on embedded platforms. This work tackles the real-time performance challenges of HAR with four contributions: 1) an experimental study identifying a standard Optical Flow (OF) extraction technique as the latency bottleneck in a state-of-the-art HAR pipeline, 2) an exploration of the latency-accuracy tradeoff between the standard and deep learning approaches to OF extraction, which highlights the need for a novel, efficient motion feature extractor, 3) the design of Integrated Motion Feature Extractor (IMFE), a novel single-shot neural network architecture for motion feature extraction with drastic improvement in latency, 4) the development of RT-HARE, a real-time HAR system tailored for embedded platforms. Experimental results on an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX platform demonstrated that RT-HARE realizes real-time HAR at a video frame rate of 30 frames per second while delivering high levels of recognition accuracy.</p>

However, labeled samples are difficult to acquire due to the low probability of anomaly occurrence, and the trained models are limited to fixed anomaly categories, which hinders the application for anomalies with few samples or unknown anomalies. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose the anomaly change detection (AnomalyCD) technique, which accepts time-series observations and learns to identify anomalous changes by learning from the historical normal change pattern. Compared to the existing techniques, AnomalyCD processes an unfixed number of time steps and can localize the various anomalies in a unified manner, without human supervision. To benchmark AnomalyCD, we constructed a high-resolution dataset with time-series images dedicated to various Earth anomalies (the AnomalyCDD dataset). AnomalyCDD contains high-resolution (from 0.15 to 2.39 m/pixel), time-series (from 3 to 7 time steps), and large-scale images (1927.93 km2 in total) collected globally Furthermore, we developed a zero-shot baseline model (AnomalyCDM), which implements the AnomalyCD technique by extracting a general representation from the segment anything model (SAM) and conducting temporal comparison to distinguish the anomalous changes from normal changes. AnomalyCDM is designed as a two-stage workflow to enhance the efficiency, and has the ability to process the unseen images directly, without retraining for each scene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Heting Gao, Mingde He, Jinqian Liang, Jason Gu, Wei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In scoliosis surgery, the limited field of view of the C-arm X-ray machine restricts the surgeons' holistic analysis of spinal structures .This paper presents an end-to-end efficient and robust intraoperative X-ray image stitching method for scoliosis surgery,named SX-Stitch. The method is divided into two stages:segmentation and stitching. In the segmentation stage, We propose a medical image segmentation model named Vision Mamba of Spine-UNet (VMS-UNet), which utilizes the state space Mamba to capture long-distance contextual information while maintaining linear computational complexity, and incorporates the SimAM attention mechanism, significantly improving the segmentation performance.In the stitching stage, we simplify the alignment process between images to the minimization of a registration energy function. The total energy function is then optimized to order unordered images, and a hybrid energy function is introduced to optimize the best seam, effectively eliminating parallax artifacts. On the clinical dataset, Sx-Stitch demonstrates superiority over SOTA schemes both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Wen, Erich Liang, Jia Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving 3D understanding of non-Lambertian objects is an important task with many useful applications, but most existing algorithms struggle to deal with such objects. One major obstacle towards progress in this field is the lack of holistic non-Lambertian benchmarks -- most benchmarks have low scene and object diversity, and none provide multi-layer 3D annotations for objects occluded by transparent surfaces. In this paper, we introduce LayeredFlow, a real world benchmark containing multi-layer ground truth annotation for optical flow of non-Lambertian objects. Compared to previous benchmarks, our benchmark exhibits greater scene and object diversity, with 150k high quality optical flow and stereo pairs taken over 185 indoor and outdoor scenes and 360 unique objects. Using LayeredFlow as evaluation data, we propose a new task called multi-layer optical flow. To provide training data for this task, we introduce a large-scale densely-annotated synthetic dataset containing 60k images within 30 scenes tailored for non-Lambertian objects. Training on our synthetic dataset enables model to predict multi-layer optical flow, while fine-tuning existing optical flow methods on the dataset notably boosts their performance on non-Lambertian objects without compromising the performance on diffuse objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Gildenblat, Ofir Hadar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Segmentation by Factorization (F-SEG), an unsupervised segmentation method for pathology that generates segmentation masks from pre-trained deep learning models. F-SEG allows the use of pre-trained deep neural networks, including recently developed pathology foundation models, for semantic segmentation. It achieves this without requiring additional training or finetuning, by factorizing the spatial features extracted by the models into segmentation masks and their associated concept features. We create generic tissue phenotypes for H&E images by training clustering models for multiple numbers of clusters on features extracted from several deep learning models on The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), and then show how the clusters can be used for factorizing corresponding segmentation masks using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Our results show that F-SEG provides robust unsupervised segmentation capabilities for H&E pathology images, and that the segmentation quality is greatly improved by utilizing pathology foundation models. We discuss and propose methods for evaluating the performance of unsupervised segmentation in pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Ferro, Alessandro Torcinovich, Arianna Traviglia, Marcello Pelillo</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary challenge for handwriting recognition systems lies in managing long-range contextual dependencies, an issue that traditional models often struggle with. To mitigate it, attention mechanisms have recently been employed to enhance context-aware labelling, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance. In the field of pattern recognition and image analysis, however, the use of contextual information in labelling problems has a long history and goes back at least to the early 1970's. Among the various approaches developed in those years, Relaxation Labelling (RL) processes have played a prominent role and have been the method of choice in the field for more than a decade. Contrary to recent transformer-based architectures, RL processes offer a principled approach to the use of contextual constraints, having a solid theoretic foundation grounded on variational inequality and game theory, as well as effective algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to handwriting recognition that integrates the strengths of two distinct methodologies. In particular, we propose integrating (trainable) RL processes with various well-established neural architectures and we introduce a sparsification technique that accelerates the convergence of the algorithm and enhances the overall system's performance. Experiments over several benchmark datasets show that RL processes can improve the generalisation ability, even surpassing in some cases transformer-based architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Safwen Naimi, Wassim Bouachir, Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau</p>
<p>Abstract: To extract robust and generalizable skeleton action recognition features, large amounts of well-curated data are typically required, which is a challenging task hindered by annotation and computation costs. Therefore, unsupervised representation learning is of prime importance to leverage unlabeled skeleton data. In this work, we investigate unsupervised representation learning for skeleton action recognition. For this purpose, we designed a lightweight convolutional transformer framework, named ReL-SAR, exploiting the complementarity of convolutional and attention layers for jointly modeling spatial and temporal cues in skeleton sequences. We also use a Selection-Permutation strategy for skeleton joints to ensure more informative descriptions from skeletal data. Finally, we capitalize on Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) to learn robust representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. We achieved very competitive results on limited-size datasets: MCAD, IXMAS, JHMDB, and NW-UCLA, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bikram Boote, Anh Thai, Wenqi Jia, Ozgur Kara, Stefan Stojanov, James M. Rehg, Sangmin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications in AR and robotics. A common failure mode in long-term point tracking occurs when the predicted point leaves the object it belongs to and lands on the background or another object. We identify this as the failure to correctly capture objectness properties in learning to track. To address this limitation of prior work, we propose a novel objectness regularization approach that guides points to be aware of object priors by forcing them to stay inside the the boundaries of object instances. By capturing objectness cues at training time, we avoid the need to compute object masks during testing. In addition, we leverage contextual attention to enhance the feature representation for capturing objectness at the feature level more effectively. As a result, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three point tracking benchmarks, and we further validate the effectiveness of our components via ablation studies.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often struggle with distribution shifts in real-world scenarios, whereas humans exhibit robust adaptation. Models that better align with human perception may achieve higher out-of-distribution generalization. In this study, we investigate how various characteristics of large-scale computer vision models influence their alignment with human capabilities and robustness. Our findings indicate that increasing model and data size and incorporating rich semantic information and multiple modalities enhance models' alignment with human perception and their overall robustness. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between out-of-distribution accuracy and human alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Borycki, Weronika Smolak, Joanna Waczy\'nska, Marcin Mazur, S{\l}awomir Tadeja, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics simulation is paramount for modeling and utilization of 3D scenes in various real-world applications. However, its integration with state-of-the-art 3D scene rendering techniques such as Gaussian Splatting (GS) remains challenging. Existing models use additional meshing mechanisms, including triangle or tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, or cage meshes. As an alternative, we can modify the physics grounded Newtonian dynamics to align with 3D Gaussian components. Current models take the first-order approximation of a deformation map, which locally approximates the dynamics by linear transformations. In contrast, our Gaussian Splatting for Physics-Based Simulations (GASP) model uses such a map (without any modifications) and flat Gaussian distributions, which are parameterized by three points (mesh faces). Subsequently, each 3D point (mesh face node) is treated as a discrete entity within a 3D space. Consequently, the problem of modeling Gaussian components is reduced to working with 3D points. Additionally, the information on mesh faces can be used to incorporate further properties into the physics model, facilitating the use of triangles. Resulting solution can be integrated into any physics engine that can be treated as a black box. As demonstrated in our studies, the proposed model exhibits superior performance on a diverse range of benchmark datasets designed for 3D object rendering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei He, Qiaoyi Wang, Honglin Sun, Qing Xu, Bolin Gao, Shengbo Eben Li, Jianqiang Wang, Keqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual bird's eye view (BEV) perception, due to its excellent perceptual capabilities, is progressively replacing costly LiDAR-based perception systems, especially in the realm of urban intelligent driving. However, this type of perception still relies on LiDAR data to construct ground truth databases, a process that is both cumbersome and time-consuming. Moreover, most massproduced autonomous driving systems are only equipped with surround camera sensors and lack LiDAR data for precise annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fine-tuning method for BEV perception network based on visual 2D semantic perception, aimed at enhancing the model's generalization capabilities in new scene data. Considering the maturity and development of 2D perception technologies, our method significantly reduces the dependency on high-cost BEV ground truths and shows promising industrial application prospects. Extensive experiments and comparative analyses conducted on the nuScenes and Waymo public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a benchmark to directly evaluate the alignment between human observers and vision models on a 3D shape inference task. We leverage an experimental design from the cognitive sciences which requires zero-shot visual inferences about object shape: given a set of images, participants identify which contain the same/different objects, despite considerable viewpoint variation. We draw from a diverse range of images that include common objects (e.g., chairs) as well as abstract shapes (i.e., procedurally generated `nonsense' objects). After constructing over 2000 unique image sets, we administer these tasks to human participants, collecting 35K trials of behavioral data from over 500 participants. This includes explicit choice behaviors as well as intermediate measures, such as reaction time and gaze data. We then evaluate the performance of common vision models (e.g., DINOv2, MAE, CLIP). We find that humans outperform all models by a wide margin. Using a multi-scale evaluation approach, we identify underlying similarities and differences between models and humans: while human-model performance is correlated, humans allocate more time/processing on challenging trials. All images, data, and code can be accessed via our project page.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulation stands as a cornerstone for safe and efficient autonomous driving development. At its core a simulation system ought to produce realistic, reactive, and controllable traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ProSim, a multimodal promptable closed-loop traffic simulation framework. ProSim allows the user to give a complex set of numerical, categorical or textual prompts to instruct each agent's behavior and intention. ProSim then rolls out a traffic scenario in a closed-loop manner, modeling each agent's interaction with other traffic participants. Our experiments show that ProSim achieves high prompt controllability given different user prompts, while reaching competitive performance on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge when no prompt is given. To support research on promptable traffic simulation, we create ProSim-Instruct-520k, a multimodal prompt-scenario paired driving dataset with over 10M text prompts for over 520k real-world driving scenarios. We will release code of ProSim as well as data and labeling tools of ProSim-Instruct-520k at https://ariostgx.github.io/ProSim.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayan Zhang, Ruibin Bai, Tie-Yan Liu, Jiawei Li, Bingchen Lin, Jianfeng Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: As a popular form of knowledge and experience, patterns and their identification have been critical tasks in most data mining applications. However, as far as we are aware, no study has systematically examined the dynamics of pattern values and their reuse under varying conditions. We argue that when problem conditions such as the distributions of random variables change, the patterns that performed well in previous circumstances may become less effective and adoption of these patterns would result in sub-optimal solutions. In response, we make a connection between data mining and the duality theory in operations research and propose a novel scheme to efficiently identify patterns and dynamically quantify their values for each specific condition. Our method quantifies the value of patterns based on their ability to satisfy stochastic constraints and their effects on the objective value, allowing high-quality patterns and their combinations to be detected. We use the online bin packing problem to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and illustrate the online packing procedure with the guidance of patterns that address the inherent uncertainty of the problem. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also analysed in detail the distinctive features of the proposed methods that lead to performance improvement and the special cases where our method can be further improved.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that reconstructs conductivity distributions within a body from boundary measurements. However, EIT reconstruction is hindered by its ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem, which complicates accurate results. To tackle this, we propose Diff-INR, a novel method that combines generative regularization with Implicit Neural Representations (INR) through a diffusion model. Diff-INR introduces geometric priors to guide the reconstruction, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional regularization methods. By integrating a pre-trained diffusion regularizer with INR, our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy in both simulation and experimental data. The method demonstrates robust performance across various mesh densities and hyperparameter settings, highlighting its flexibility and efficiency. This advancement represents a significant improvement in managing the ill-posed nature of EIT. Furthermore, the method's principles are applicable to other imaging modalities facing similar challenges with ill-posed inverse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiying Wang, Abhirup Banerjee, Vicente Grau</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common health threats worldwide. 2D x-ray invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains as the most widely adopted imaging modality for CVDs diagnosis. However, in current clinical practice, it is often difficult for the cardiologists to interpret the 3D geometry of coronary vessels based on 2D planes. Moreover, due to the radiation limit, in general only two angiographic projections are acquired, providing limited information of the vessel geometry and necessitating 3D coronary tree reconstruction based only on two ICA projections. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised deep learning method called NeCA, which is based on implicit neural representation using the multiresolution hash encoder and differentiable cone-beam forward projector layer in order to achieve 3D coronary artery tree reconstruction from two projections. We validate our method using six different metrics on coronary computed tomography angiography data in terms of right coronary artery and left anterior descending respectively. The evaluation results demonstrate that our NeCA method, without 3D ground truth for supervision and large datasets for training, achieves promising performance in both vessel topology preservation and branch-connectivity maintaining compared to the supervised deep learning model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Hemati, Krishna R. Kalari, H. R. Tizhoosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by enabling the digitization, storage, and analysis of tissue samples as whole slide images (WSIs). WSIs are gigapixel files that capture the intricate details of tissue samples, providing a rich source of information for diagnostic and research purposes. However, due to their enormous size, representing these images as one compact vector is essential for many computational pathology tasks, such as search and retrieval, to ensure efficiency and scalability. Most current methods are "patch-oriented," meaning they divide WSIs into smaller patches for processing, which prevents a holistic analysis of the entire slide. Additionally, the necessity for compact representation is driven by the expensive high-performance storage required for WSIs. Not all hospitals have access to such extensive storage solutions, leading to potential disparities in healthcare quality and accessibility. This paper provides an overview of existing set-based approaches to single-vector WSI representation, highlighting the innovations that allow for more efficient and effective use of these complex images in digital pathology, thus addressing both computational challenges and storage limitations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We have tested recently published foundation models for histopathology for image retrieval. We report macro average of F1 score for top-1 retrieval, majority of top-3 retrievals, and majority of top-5 retrievals.

As test data, we used diagnostic slides of TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 23 organs and 117 cancer subtypes. As a search platform we used Yottixel that enabled us to perform WSI search using patches. Achieved F1 scores show low performance, e.g., for top-5 retrievals, 27% +/- 13% (Yottixel-DenseNet), 42% +/- 14% (Yottixel-UNI), 40%+/-13% (Yottixel-Virchow), and 41%+/-13% (Yottixel-GigaPath). The results for GigaPath WSI will be delayed due to the significant computational resources required for processing</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mars Science Helicopter (MSH) mission aims to deploy the next generation of unmanned helicopters on Mars, targeting landing sites in highly irregular terrain such as Valles Marineris, the largest canyons in the Solar system with elevation variances of up to 8000 meters. Unlike its predecessor, the Mars 2020 mission, which relied on a state estimation system assuming planar terrain, MSH requires a novel approach due to the complex topography of the landing site. This work introduces a novel range-visual-inertial odometry system tailored for the unique challenges of the MSH mission. Our system extends the state-of-the-art xVIO framework by fusing consistent range information with visual and inertial measurements, preventing metric scale drift in the absence of visual-inertial excitation (mono camera and constant velocity descent), and enabling landing on any terrain structure, without requiring any planar terrain assumption. Through extensive testing in image-based simulations using actual terrain structure and textures collected in Mars orbit, we demonstrate that our range-VIO approach estimates terrain-relative velocity meeting the stringent mission requirements, and outperforming existing methods.</p>

This task is of paramount importance in the field of sound engineering, despite being relatively under-explored. The conventional manual process for detecting and eliminating these sounds requires significant expertise and is extremely time-intensive. Existing automated detection and removal methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and precision. Our proposed model addresses these limitations by offering a streamlined process and superior accuracy, achieved through the application of advanced deep learning techniques. A unique dataset, derived from Device and Produced Speech (DAPS), was employed for this purpose. The training phase of the model emphasizes a log spectrogram and integrates an early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting. Our model not only conserves precious time for sound engineers but also enhances the quality and consistency of audio production. This constitutes a significant breakthrough, as evidenced by its comparative efficiency, necessitating only 1.9M parameters and a training duration of 3.2 hours - markedly less than the top-performing models in this domain. The model is capable of generating identical outputs as previous models with drastically improved precision, making it an optimal choice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wang, Zijun Gao, Mingxiu Sui, Taiyuan Mei, Xiaohan Cheng, Iris Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of deep learning technology in practical applications, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been able to assist humans in solving many real-world problems. To enhance the performance of CNNs, numerous network architectures have been explored. Some of these architectures are designed based on the accumulated experience of researchers over time, while others are designed through neural architecture search methods. The improvements made to CNNs by the aforementioned methods are quite significant, but most of the improvement methods are limited in reality by model size and environmental constraints, making it difficult to fully realize the improved performance. In recent years, research has found that many CNN structures can be explained by the discretization of ordinary differential equations. This implies that we can design theoretically supported deep network structures using higher-order numerical difference methods. It should be noted that most of the previous CNN model structures are based on low-order numerical methods. Therefore, considering that the accuracy of linear multi-step numerical difference methods is higher than that of the forward Euler method, this paper proposes a stacking scheme based on the linear multi-step method. This scheme enhances the performance of ResNet without increasing the model size and compares it with the Runge-Kutta scheme. The experimental results show that the performance of the stacking scheme proposed in this paper is superior to existing stacking schemes (ResNet and HO-ResNet), and it has the capability to be extended to other types of neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichao Li, Aizier Abulaiti, Yaojie Lu, Xuanang Chen, Jia Zheng, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 2,233 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv and GitHub. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Ortega-Beltr\'an, Josep Cabacas-Maso, Ismael Benito-Altamirano, Carles Ventura</p>
<p>Abstract: Within the context of creating new Socially Assistive Robots, emotion recognition has become a key development factor, as it allows the robot to adapt to the user's emotional state in the wild. In this work, we focused on the analysis of two voice recording Spanish datasets: ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Specifically, we centered our work in the paralanguage, e.~g. the vocal characteristics that go along with the message and clarifies the meaning. We proposed the use of the DeepSpectrum method, which consists of extracting a visual representation of the audio tracks and feeding them to a pretrained CNN model. For the classification task, DeepSpectrum is often paired with a Support Vector Classifier --DS-SVC--, or a Fully-Connected deep-learning classifier --DS-FC--. We compared the results of the DS-SVC and DS-FC architectures with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Moreover, we proposed our own classifier based upon Attention Mechanisms, namely DS-AM. We trained all models against both datasets, and we found that our DS-AM model outperforms the SOTA models for the datasets and the SOTA DeepSpectrum architectures. Finally, we trained our DS-AM model in one dataset and tested it in the other, to simulate real-world conditions on how biased is the model to the dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fungal simulation and control are considered crucial techniques in Bio-Art creation. However, coding algorithms for reliable fungal simulations have posed significant challenges for artists. This study equates fungal morphology simulation to a two-dimensional graphic time-series generation problem. We propose a zero-coding, neural network-driven cellular automaton. Fungal spread patterns are learned through an image segmentation model and a time-series prediction model, which then supervise the training of neural network cells, enabling them to replicate real-world spreading behaviors. We further implemented dynamic containment of fungal boundaries with lasers. Synchronized with the automaton, the fungus successfully spreads into pre-designed complex shapes in reality.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Deep Neural Networks have achieved thrilling breakthroughs in the past decade, data augmentations have garnered increasing attention as regularization techniques when massive labeled data are unavailable. Among existing augmentations, Mixup and relevant data-mixing methods that convexly combine selected samples and the corresponding labels are widely adopted because they yield high performances by generating data-dependent virtual data while easily migrating to various domains. This survey presents a comprehensive review of foundational mixup methods and their applications. We first elaborate on the training pipeline with mixup augmentations as a unified framework containing modules. A reformulated framework could contain various mixup methods and give intuitive operational procedures. Then, we systematically investigate the applications of mixup augmentations on vision downstream tasks, various data modalities, and some analysis \& theorems of mixup. Meanwhile, we conclude the current status and limitations of mixup research and point out further work for effective and efficient mixup augmentations. This survey can provide researchers with the current state of the art in mixup methods and provide some insights and guidance roles in the mixup arena.

<p>Abstract: Organ transplantation serves as the primary therapeutic strategy for end-stage organ failures. However, allograft rejection is a common complication of organ transplantation. Histological assessment is essential for the timely detection and diagnosis of transplant rejection and remains the gold standard. Nevertheless, the traditional histochemical staining process is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. Here, we present a panel of virtual staining neural networks for lung and heart transplant biopsies, which digitally convert autofluorescence microscopic images of label-free tissue sections into their brightfield histologically stained counterparts, bypassing the traditional histochemical staining process. Specifically, we virtually generated Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Masson's Trichrome (MT), and Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson (EVG) stains for label-free transplant lung tissue, along with H&E and MT stains for label-free transplant heart tissue. Subsequent blind evaluations conducted by three board-certified pathologists have confirmed that the virtual staining networks consistently produce high-quality histology images with high color uniformity, closely resembling their well-stained histochemical counterparts across various tissue features. The use of virtually stained images for the evaluation of transplant biopsies achieved comparable diagnostic outcomes to those obtained via traditional histochemical staining, with a concordance rate of 82.4% for lung samples and 91.7% for heart samples. Moreover, virtual staining models create multiple stains from the same autofluorescence input, eliminating structural mismatches observed between adjacent sections stained in the traditional workflow, while also saving tissue, expert time, and staining costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores a top-down approach to automating incremental advances in machine learning research through component-level innovation, facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework systematically generates novel components, validates their feasibility, and evaluates their performance against existing baselines. A key distinction of this approach lies in how these novel components are generated. Unlike traditional AutoML and NAS methods, which often rely on a bottom-up combinatorial search over predefined, hardcoded base components, our method leverages the cross-domain knowledge embedded in LLMs to propose new components that may not be confined to any hard-coded predefined set. By incorporating a reward model to prioritize promising hypotheses, we aim to improve the efficiency of the hypothesis generation and evaluation process. We hope this approach offers a new avenue for exploration and contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a unified surface reconstruction and rendering framework for LiDAR-visual systems, integrating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Neural Distance Fields (NDF) to recover both appearance and structural information from posed images and point clouds. We address the structural visible gap between NeRF and NDF by utilizing a visible-aware occupancy map to classify space into the free, occupied, visible unknown, and background regions. This classification facilitates the recovery of a complete appearance and structure of the scene. We unify the training of the NDF and NeRF using a spatial-varying scale SDF-to-density transformation for levels of detail for both structure and appearance. The proposed method leverages the learned NDF for structure-aware NeRF training by an adaptive sphere tracing sampling strategy for accurate structure rendering. In return, NeRF further refines structural in recovering missing or fuzzy structures in the NDF. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality and versatility of the proposed method across various scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Hasebul Hasan, Md Abid Jahan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Yuan-Fang Li, Timos Sellis</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of house price, a vital aspect of the residential real estate sector, is of substantial interest for a wide range of stakeholders. However, predicting house prices is a complex task due to the significant variability influenced by factors such as house features, location, neighborhood, and many others. Despite numerous attempts utilizing a wide array of algorithms, including recent deep learning techniques, to predict house prices accurately, existing approaches have fallen short of considering a wide range of factors such as textual and visual features. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively incorporating attributes, such as features, textual descriptions, geo-spatial neighborhood, and house images, typically showcased in real estate listings in a house price prediction system. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal deep learning approach that leverages different types of data to learn more accurate representation of the house. In particular, we learn a joint embedding of raw house attributes, geo-spatial neighborhood, and most importantly from textual description and images representing the house; and finally use a downstream regression model to predict the house price from this jointly learned embedding vector. Our experimental results with a real-world dataset show that the text embedding of the house advertisement description and image embedding of the house pictures in addition to raw attributes and geo-spatial embedding, can significantly improve the house price prediction accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results in image generation and have been applied to various fields. However, DMs sometimes seriously violate user privacy during usage, making the protection of privacy an urgent issue. Using traditional privacy computing schemes like Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) directly in DMs faces significant computation and communication challenges. To address these issues, we propose CipherDM, the first novel, versatile and universal framework applying MPC technology to DMs for secure sampling, which can be widely implemented on multiple DM based tasks. We thoroughly analyze sampling latency breakdown, find time-consuming parts and design corresponding secure MPC protocols for computing nonlinear activations including SoftMax, SiLU and Mish. CipherDM is evaluated on popular architectures (DDPM, DDIM) using MNIST dataset and on SD deployed by diffusers. Compared to direct implementation on SPU, our approach improves running time by approximately 1.084\times \sim 2.328\times, and reduces communication costs by approximately 1.212\times \sim 1.791\times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiru Wang, Yao Chen, Lesley A. Jarvis, Yucheng Tang, David J. Gladstone, Kimberley S. Samkoe, Brian W. Pogue, Petr Bruza, Rongxiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cherenkov imaging enables real-time visualization of megavoltage X-ray or electron beam delivery to the patient during Radiation Therapy (RT). Bio-morphological features, such as vasculature, seen in these images are patient-specific signatures that can be used for verification of positioning and motion management that are essential to precise RT treatment. However until now, no concerted analysis of this biological feature-based tracking was utilized because of the slow speed and accuracy of conventional image processing for feature segmentation. This study demonstrated the first deep learning framework for such an application, achieving video frame rate processing. To address the challenge of limited annotation of these features in Cherenkov images, a transfer learning strategy was applied. A fundus photography dataset including 20,529 patch retina images with ground-truth vessel annotation was used to pre-train a ResNet segmentation framework. Subsequently, a small Cherenkov dataset (1,483 images from 212 treatment fractions of 19 breast cancer patients) with known annotated vasculature masks was used to fine-tune the model for accurate segmentation prediction. This deep learning framework achieved consistent and rapid segmentation of Cherenkov-imaged bio-morphological features on another 19 patients, including subcutaneous veins, scars, and pigmented skin. Average segmentation by the model achieved Dice score of 0.85 and required less than 0.7 milliseconds processing time per instance. The model demonstrated outstanding consistency against input image variances and speed compared to conventional manual segmentation methods, laying the foundation for online segmentation in real-time monitoring in a prospective setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Chen, Savannah M. Decker, Petr Bruza, David J. Gladstone, Lesley A. Jarvis, Brian W. Pogue, Kimberley S. Samkoe, Rongxiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate patient positioning is critical for precise radiotherapy dose delivery, as positioning errors can significantly affect treatment outcomes. This study introduces a novel method for tracking loco-regional tissue deformation through Cherenkov image analysis during fractionated breast cancer radiotherapy. The primary goal was to develop and test an algorithm for Cherenkov-based regional position accuracy quantification, specifically for loco-regional deformations, which lack ideal quantification methods in radiotherapy. Blood vessel detection and segmentation were developed in Cherenkov images using a tissue phantom with incremental movements, and later applied to images from fractionated whole breast radiotherapy in human patients (n=10). A combined rigid and non-rigid registration technique was used to detect inter- and intra-fractional positioning variations. This approach quantified positioning variations in two parts: a global shift from rigid registration and a two-dimensional variation map of loco-regional deformation from non-rigid registration. The methodology was validated using an anthropomorphic chest phantom experiment, where known treatment couch translations and respiratory motion were simulated to assess inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, yielding an average accuracy of 0.83 mm for couch translations up to 20 mm. Analysis of clinical Cherenkov data from ten breast cancer patients showed an inter-fraction setup variation of 3.7 plus minus 2.4 mm relative to the first fraction and loco-regional deformations (95th percentile) of up to 3.3 plus minus 1.9 mm. This study presents a Cherenkov-based approach to quantify global and local positioning variations, demonstrating feasibility in addressing loco-regional deformations that conventional imaging techniques fail to capture.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an approach to referring expression generation (REG) in visually grounded dialogue that is meant to produce referring expressions (REs) that are both discriminative and discourse-appropriate. Our method constitutes a two-stage process. First, we model REG as a text- and image-conditioned next-token prediction task. REs are autoregressively generated based on their preceding linguistic context and a visual representation of the referent. Second, we propose the use of discourse-aware comprehension guiding as part of a generate-and-rerank strategy through which candidate REs generated with our REG model are reranked based on their discourse-dependent discriminatory power. Results from our human evaluation indicate that our proposed two-stage approach is effective in producing discriminative REs, with higher performance in terms of text-image retrieval accuracy for reranked REs compared to those generated using greedy decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object grasping is a crucial technology enabling robots to perceive and interact with the environment sufficiently. However, in practical applications, researchers are faced with missing or noisy ground truth while training the convolutional neural network, which decreases the accuracy of the model. Therefore, different loss functions are proposed to deal with these problems to improve the accuracy of the neural network. For missing ground truth, a new predicted category probability method is defined for unlabeled samples, which works effectively in conjunction with the pseudo-labeling method. Furthermore, for noisy ground truth, a symmetric loss function is introduced to resist the corruption of label noises. The proposed loss functions are powerful, robust, and easy to use. Experimental results based on the typical grasping neural network show that our method can improve performance by 2 to 13 percent.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a Consensus-based Distributed Quantum Kernel Learning (CDQKL) framework aimed at improving speech recognition through distributed quantum computing.CDQKL addresses the challenges of scalability and data privacy in centralized quantum kernel learning. It does this by distributing computational tasks across quantum terminals, which are connected through classical channels. This approach enables the exchange of model parameters without sharing local training data, thereby maintaining data privacy and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark speech emotion recognition datasets demonstrate that CDQKL achieves competitive classification accuracy and scalability compared to centralized and local quantum kernel learning models. The distributed nature of CDQKL offers advantages in privacy preservation and computational efficiency, making it suitable for data-sensitive fields such as telecommunications, automotive, and finance. The findings suggest that CDQKL can effectively leverage distributed quantum computing for large-scale machine-learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Vrabel, Ori Shem-Ur, Yaron Oz, David Krueger</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend the concept of loss landscape mode connectivity to the input space of deep neural networks. Mode connectivity was originally studied within parameter space, where it describes the existence of low-loss paths between different solutions (loss minimizers) obtained through gradient descent. We present theoretical and empirical evidence of its presence in the input space of deep networks, thereby highlighting the broader nature of the phenomenon. We observe that different input images with similar predictions are generally connected, and for trained models, the path tends to be simple, with only a small deviation from being a linear path. Our methodology utilizes real, interpolated, and synthetic inputs created using the input optimization technique for feature visualization. We conjecture that input space mode connectivity in high-dimensional spaces is a geometric effect that takes place even in untrained models and can be explained through percolation theory. We exploit mode connectivity to obtain new insights about adversarial examples and demonstrate its potential for adversarial detection. Additionally, we discuss applications for the interpretability of deep networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Jiang, Yao Gao, Shaohua Gao, Zhonghua Yi, Lei Sun, Hao Shi, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang, Jian Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging without repeated data preparation and model training to accommodate new lens designs. However, the training databases in these approaches, i.e., the lens libraries (LensLibs), suffer from their limited coverage of real-world aberration behaviors. In this work, we set up an OmniLens framework for universal CAC, considering both the generalization ability and flexibility. OmniLens extends the idea of universal CAC to a broader concept, where a base model is trained for three cases, including zero-shot CAC with the pre-trained model, few-shot CAC with a little lens-specific data for fine-tuning, and domain adaptive CAC using domain adaptation for lens-descriptions-unknown lens. In terms of OmniLens's data foundation, we first propose an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline to construct LensLib automatically, coined AODLib, whose diversity is enriched by an evolution framework, with comprehensive constraints and a hybrid optimization strategy for achieving realistic aberration behaviors. For network design, we introduce the guidance of high-quality codebook priors to facilitate zero-shot CAC and few-shot CAC, which enhances the model's generalization ability, while also boosting its convergence in a few-shot case. Furthermore, based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in optical degradation, we design an unsupervised regularization term to adapt the base model to the target descriptions-unknown lens using its aberration images without ground truth. We validate OmniLens on 4 manually designed low-end lenses with various structures and aberration behaviors. Remarkably, the base model trained on AODLib exhibits strong generalization capabilities, achieving 97% of the lens-specific performance in a zero-shot setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murtaza Dalal, Jiahui Yang, Russell Mendonca, Youssef Khaky, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: The current paradigm for motion planning generates solutions from scratch for every new problem, which consumes significant amounts of time and computational resources. For complex, cluttered scenes, motion planning approaches can often take minutes to produce a solution, while humans are able to accurately and safely reach any goal in seconds by leveraging their prior experience. We seek to do the same by applying data-driven learning at scale to the problem of motion planning. Our approach builds a large number of complex scenes in simulation, collects expert data from a motion planner, then distills it into a reactive generalist policy. We then combine this with lightweight optimization to obtain a safe path for real world deployment. We perform a thorough evaluation of our method on 64 motion planning tasks across four diverse environments with randomized poses, scenes and obstacles, in the real world, demonstrating an improvement of 23%, 17% and 79% motion planning success rate over state of the art sampling, optimization and learning based planning methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Attal, Dor Verbin, Ben Mildenhall, Peter Hedman, Jonathan T. Barron, Matthew O'Toole, Pratul P. Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray. Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache. We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkui Tan, Zhuangwei Zhuang, Sitao Chen, Rong Li, Kui Jia, Qicheng Wang, Yuanqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We study multi-sensor fusion for 3D semantic segmentation that is important to scene understanding for many applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Existing fusion-based methods, however, may not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between the two modalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called perception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to effectively exploit perceptual information from two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and spatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we project point clouds to the camera coordinate using perspective projection, and process both inputs from LiDAR and cameras in 2D space while preventing the information loss of RGB images. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two modalities, separately. The extracted features are fused by effective residual-based fusion modules. Moreover, we introduce additional perception-aware losses to measure the perceptual difference between the two modalities. Last, we propose an improved version of PMF, i.e., EPMF, which is more efficient and effective by optimizing data pre-processing and network architecture under perspective projection. Specifically, we propose cross-modal alignment and cropping to obtain tight inputs and reduce unnecessary computational costs. We then explore more efficient contextual modules under perspective projection and fuse the LiDAR features into the camera stream to boost the performance of the two-stream network. Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For example, on nuScenes test set, our EPMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method, i.e., RangeFormer, by 0.9% in mIoU. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ICEORY/PMF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lip sync is a fundamental audio-visual task. However, existing lip sync methods fall short of being robust in the wild. One important cause could be distracting factors on the visual input side, making extracting lip motion information difficult. To address these issues, this paper proposes a data standardization pipeline to standardize the visual input for lip sync. Based on recent advances in 3D face reconstruction, we first create a model that can consistently disentangle lip motion information from the raw images. Then, standardized images are synthesized with disentangled lip motion information, with all other attributes related to distracting factors set to predefined values independent of the input, to reduce their effects. Using synthesized images, existing lip sync methods improve their data efficiency and robustness, and they achieve competitive performance for the active speaker detection task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stuti Pathak, Thomas M. McDonald, Seppe Sels, Rudi Penne</p>
<p>Abstract: The processing, storage and transmission of large-scale point clouds is an ongoing challenge in the computer vision community which hinders progress in the application of 3D models to real-world settings, such as autonomous driving, virtual reality and remote sensing. We propose a novel, one-shot point cloud simplification method which preserves both the salient structural features and the overall shape of a point cloud without any prior surface reconstruction step. Our method employs Gaussian processes suitable for functions defined on Riemannian manifolds, allowing us to model the surface variation function across any given point cloud. A simplified version of the original cloud is obtained by sequentially selecting points using a greedy sparsification scheme. The selection criterion used for this scheme ensures that the simplified cloud best represents the surface variation of the original point cloud. We evaluate our method on several benchmark and self-acquired point clouds, compare it to a range of existing methods, demonstrate its application in downstream tasks of registration and surface reconstruction, and show that our method is competitive both in terms of empirical performance and computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Xiong, Long Zhao, Boqing Gong, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Florian Schroff, Ting Liu, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Liangzhe Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing video-language pre-training methods primarily focus on instance-level alignment between video clips and captions via global contrastive learning but neglect rich fine-grained local information in both videos and text, which is of importance to downstream tasks requiring temporal localization and semantic reasoning. A powerful model is expected to be capable of capturing region-object correspondences and recognizing scene changes in a video clip, reflecting spatial and temporal granularity, respectively. To strengthen model's understanding into such fine-grained details, we propose a simple yet effective video-language modeling framework, S-ViLM, by exploiting the intrinsic structures of these two modalities. It includes two novel designs, inter-clip spatial grounding and intra-clip temporal grouping, to promote learning region-object alignment and temporal-aware features, simultaneously. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that S-ViLM performs favorably against existing approaches in learning more expressive representations. Specifically, S-ViLM surpasses the state-of-the-art methods substantially on four representative downstream tasks, covering text-video retrieval, video question answering, video action recognition, and temporal action localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Smith, Frank Ferrie</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning-based computer vision algorithms continue to advance the state of the art, their robustness to real-world data continues to be an issue, making it difficult to bring an algorithm from the lab to the real world. Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout have been successfully used in many applications in an attempt to address this robustness issue. Unfortunately, it is not always clear if such ensemble-based approaches can be applied to a new problem domain. This is the case with panoptic segmentation, where the structure of the problem and architectures designed to solve it means that unlike image classification or even semantic segmentation, the typical solution of using a mean across samples cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we demonstrate how ensemble-based uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout can be used in the panoptic segmentation domain with no changes to an existing network, providing both improved performance and more importantly a better measure of uncertainty for predictions made by the network. Results are demonstrated quantitatively and qualitatively on the COCO, KITTI-STEP and VIPER datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately detecting student behavior in classroom videos can aid in analyzing their classroom performance and improving teaching effectiveness. However, the current accuracy rate in behavior detection is low. To address this challenge, we propose the Student Classroom Behavior Detection system based on based on YOLOv7-BRA (YOLOv7 with Bi-level Routing Attention ). We identified eight different behavior patterns, including standing, sitting, speaking, listening, walking, raising hands, reading, and writing. We constructed a dataset, which contained 11,248 labels and 4,001 images, with an emphasis on the common behavior of raising hands in a classroom setting (Student Classroom Behavior dataset, SCB-Dataset). To improve detection accuracy, we added the biformer attention module to the YOLOv7 network. Finally, we fused the results from YOLOv7 CrowdHuman, SlowFast, and DeepSort models to obtain student classroom behavior data. We conducted experiments on the SCB-Dataset, and YOLOv7-BRA achieved an mAP@0.5 of 87.1%, resulting in a 2.2% improvement over previous results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjia Shi, Shuaifeng Zhi, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D plane reconstruction from images can usually be divided into several sub-tasks of plane detection, segmentation, parameters regression and possibly depth prediction for per-frame, along with plane correspondence and relative camera pose estimation between frames. Previous works tend to divide and conquer these sub-tasks with distinct network modules, overall formulated by a two-stage paradigm. With an initial camera pose and per-frame plane predictions provided from the first stage, exclusively designed modules, potentially relying on extra plane correspondence labelling, are applied to merge multi-view plane entities and produce 6DoF camera pose. As none of existing works manage to integrate above closely related sub-tasks into a unified framework but treat them separately and sequentially, we suspect it potentially as a main source of performance limitation for existing approaches. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR++, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time unifies all sub-tasks related to multi-view reconstruction and pose estimation with a compact single-stage model, refraining from initial pose estimation and plane correspondence supervision. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across sub-tasks, obtaining a new state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNetv1, ScanNetv2, NYUv2-Plane, and MatterPort3D datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Teng, Jiaming Zhang, Kunyu Peng, Yaonan Wang, Rainer Stiefelhagen, Kailun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Light field cameras are capable of capturing intricate angular and spatial details. This allows for acquiring complex light patterns and details from multiple angles, significantly enhancing the precision of image semantic segmentation. However, two significant issues arise: (1) The extensive angular information of light field cameras contains a large amount of redundant data, which is overwhelming for the limited hardware resources of intelligent agents. (2) A relative displacement difference exists in the data collected by different micro-lenses. To address these issues, we propose an Omni-Aperture Fusion model (OAFuser) that leverages dense context from the central view and extracts the angular information from sub-aperture images to generate semantically consistent results. To simultaneously streamline the redundant information from the light field cameras and avoid feature loss during network propagation, we present a simple yet very effective Sub-Aperture Fusion Module (SAFM). This module efficiently embeds sub-aperture images in angular features, allowing the network to process each sub-aperture image with a minimal computational demand of only (around 1GFlops). Furthermore, to address the mismatched spatial information across viewpoints, we present a Center Angular Rectification Module (CARM) to realize feature resorting and prevent feature occlusion caused by misalignment. The proposed OAFuser achieves state-of-the-art performance on four UrbanLF datasets in terms of all evaluation metrics and sets a new record of 84.93% in mIoU on the UrbanLF-Real Extended dataset, with a gain of +3.69%.

<p>Abstract: Logo embedding models convert the product logos in images into vectors, enabling their utilization for logo recognition and detection within e-commerce platforms. This facilitates the enforcement of intellectual property rights and enhances product search capabilities. However, current methods treat logo embedding as a purely visual problem. A noteworthy issue is that visual models capture features more than logos. Instead, we view this as a multimodal task, using text as auxiliary information to facilitate the visual model's understanding of the logo. The emerging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both visual and textual understanding. Inspired by this, we propose an approach, \textbf{FashionLOGO}, to explore how to prompt MLLMs to generate appropriate text for product images, which can help visual models achieve better logo embeddings. We adopt a cross-attention transformer block that enables visual embedding to automatically learn supplementary knowledge from textual embedding. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets prove that FashionLOGO is capable of generating generic and robust logo embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown a profound impact on natural language processing but are yet to fully embrace the realm of 3D understanding. This paper introduces PointLLM, a preliminary effort to fill this gap, enabling LLMs to understand point clouds and offering a new avenue beyond 2D visual data. PointLLM understands colored object point clouds with human instructions and generates contextually appropriate responses, illustrating its grasp of point clouds and common sense. Specifically, it leverages a point cloud encoder with a powerful LLM to effectively fuse geometric, appearance, and linguistic information. We collect a novel dataset comprising 660K simple and 70K complex point-text instruction pairs to enable a two-stage training strategy: aligning latent spaces and subsequently instruction-tuning the unified model. To rigorously evaluate the perceptual and generalization capabilities of PointLLM, we establish two benchmarks: Generative 3D Object Classification and 3D Object Captioning, assessed through three different methods, including human evaluation, GPT-4/ChatGPT evaluation, and traditional metrics. Experimental results reveal PointLLM's superior performance over existing 2D and 3D baselines, with a notable achievement in human-evaluated object captioning tasks where it surpasses human annotators in over 50% of the samples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Shvetsova, Anna Kukleva, Xudong Hong, Christian Rupprecht, Bernt Schiele, Hilde Kuehne</p>
<p>Abstract: Instructional videos are a common source for learning text-video or even multimodal representations by leveraging subtitles extracted with automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) from the audio signal in the videos. However, in contrast to human-annotated captions, both speech and subtitles naturally differ from the visual content of the videos and thus provide only noisy supervision. As a result, large-scale annotation-free web video training data remains sub-optimal for training text-video models. In this work, we propose to leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality video descriptions aligned with videos at scale. Specifically, we prompt an LLM to create plausible video captions based on ASR subtitles of instructional videos. To this end, we introduce a prompting method that is able to take into account a longer text of subtitles, allowing us to capture the contextual information beyond one single sentence. We further prompt the LLM to generate timestamps for each produced caption based on the timestamps of the subtitles and finally align the generated captions to the video temporally. In this way, we obtain human-style video captions at scale without human supervision. We apply our method to the subtitles of the HowTo100M dataset, creating a new large-scale dataset, HowToCaption. Our evaluation shows that the resulting captions not only significantly improve the performance over many different benchmark datasets for zero-shot text-video retrieval and video captioning, but also lead to a disentangling of textual narration from the audio, boosting the performance in text-video-audio tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yang, Xiaofei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Using deep learning methods to detect students' classroom behavior automatically is a promising approach for analyzing their class performance and improving teaching effectiveness. However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field. The SCB-ST-Dataset4 is available for download at: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyao Duan, Zhiliu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous attempts to integrate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework either rely on the assumption of static scenes or require the ground truth camera poses, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilin Wen, Hao Pan, Takehiko Ohkawa, Lei Yang, Jia Pan, Yoichi Sato, Taku Komura, Wenping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel unified framework that concurrently tackles recognition and future prediction for human hand pose and action modeling. Previous works generally provide isolated solutions for either recognition or prediction, which not only increases the complexity of integration in practical applications, but more importantly, cannot exploit the synergy of both sides and suffer suboptimal performances in their respective domains. To address this problem, we propose a generative Transformer VAE architecture to model hand pose and action, where the encoder and decoder capture recognition and prediction respectively, and their connection through the VAE bottleneck mandates the learning of consistent hand motion from the past to the future and vice versa. Furthermore, to faithfully model the semantic dependency and different temporal granularity of hand pose and action, we decompose the framework into two cascaded VAE blocks: the first and latter blocks respectively model the short-span poses and long-span action, and are connected by a mid-level feature representing a sub-second series of hand poses. This decomposition into block cascades facilitates capturing both short-term and long-term temporal regularity in pose and action modeling, and enables training two blocks separately to fully utilize datasets with annotations of different temporal granularities. We train and evaluate our framework across multiple datasets; results show that our joint modeling of recognition and prediction improves over isolated solutions, and that our semantic and temporal hierarchy facilitates long-term pose and action modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artemis Panagopoulou, Le Xue, Ning Yu, Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Shafiq Joty, Ran Xu, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Juan Carlos Niebles</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has achieved significant advancements in visual reasoning tasks through learning image-to-language projections and leveraging the impressive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces an efficient and effective framework that integrates multiple modalities (images, 3D, audio and video) to a frozen LLM and demonstrates an emergent ability for cross-modal reasoning (2+ modality inputs). Our approach explores two distinct projection mechanisms: Q-Formers and Linear Projections (LPs). Through extensive experimentation across all four modalities on 16 benchmarks, we explore both methods and assess their adaptability in integrated and separate cross-modal reasoning. The Q-Former projection demonstrates superior performance in single modality scenarios and adaptability in joint versus discriminative reasoning involving two or more modalities. However, it exhibits lower generalization capabilities than linear projection in contexts where task-modality data are limited. To enable this framework, we devise a scalable pipeline that automatically generates high-quality, instruction-tuning datasets from readily available captioning data across different modalities, and contribute 24K QA data for audio and 250K QA data for 3D. To facilitate further research in cross-modal reasoning, we introduce the DisCRn (Discriminative Cross-modal Reasoning) benchmark comprising 9K audio-video QA samples and 28K image-3D QA samples that require the model to reason discriminatively across disparate input modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin-Shih Wu, Hong-En Chen, Sheng-Yu Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the lack of large-scale text-3D correspondence data, recent text-to-3D generation works mainly rely on utilizing 2D diffusion models for synthesizing 3D data. Since diffusion-based methods typically require significant optimization time for both training and inference, the use of GAN-based models would still be desirable for fast 3D generation. In this work, we propose Triplane Attention for text-guided 3D generation (TPA3D), an end-to-end trainable GAN-based deep learning model for fast text-to-3D generation. With only 3D shape data and their rendered 2D images observed during training, our TPA3D is designed to retrieve detailed visual descriptions for synthesizing the corresponding 3D mesh data. This is achieved by the proposed attention mechanisms on the extracted sentence and word-level text features. In our experiments, we show that TPA3D generates high-quality 3D textured shapes aligned with fine-grained descriptions, while impressive computation efficiency can be observed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Chen, Jia Li, Shiguang Shan, Meng Wang, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) in the wild is still hindered by data limitations, e.g., insufficient quantity and diversity of pose, occlusion and illumination, as well as the inherent ambiguity of facial expressions. In contrast, static facial expression recognition (SFER) currently shows much higher performance and can benefit from more abundant high-quality training data. Moreover, the appearance features and dynamic dependencies of DFER remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel Static-to-Dynamic model (S2D) that leverages existing SFER knowledge and dynamic information implicitly encoded in extracted facial landmark-aware features, thereby significantly improving DFER performance. Firstly, we build and train an image model for SFER, which incorporates a standard Vision Transformer (ViT) and Multi-View Complementary Prompters (MCPs) only. Then, we obtain our video model (i.e., S2D), for DFER, by inserting Temporal-Modeling Adapters (TMAs) into the image model. MCPs enhance facial expression features with landmark-aware features inferred by an off-the-shelf facial landmark detector. And the TMAs capture and model the relationships of dynamic changes in facial expressions, effectively extending the pre-trained image model for videos. Notably, MCPs and TMAs only increase a fraction of trainable parameters (less than +10\%) to the original image model. Moreover, we present a novel Emotion-Anchors (i.e., reference samples for each emotion category) based Self-Distillation Loss to reduce the detrimental influence of ambiguous emotion labels, further enhancing our S2D. Experiments conducted on popular SFER and DFER datasets show that we achieve the state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Liu, Yuanhe Guo, Shengjie Wang, Hongyi Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, capable of high-quality image generation, receive unparalleled popularity for their ease of extension. Active users have created a massive collection of domain-specific diffusion models by fine-tuning base models on self-collected datasets. Recent work has focused on improving a single diffusion model by uncovering semantic and visual information encoded in various architecture components. However, those methods overlook the vastly available set of fine-tuned diffusion models and, therefore, miss the opportunity to utilize their combined capacity for novel generation. In this work, we propose Diffusion Cocktail (Ditail), a training-free method that transfers style and content information between multiple diffusion models. This allows us to perform diversified generations using a set of diffusion models, resulting in novel images unobtainable by a single model. Ditail also offers fine-grained control of the generation process, which enables flexible manipulations of styles and contents. With these properties, Ditail excels in numerous applications, including style transfer guided by diffusion models, novel-style image generation, and image manipulation via prompts or collage inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Teng, Yunchuan Ma, Guorong Li, Yuankai Qi, Laiyu Qing, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Describing video content according to users' needs is a long-held goal. Although existing video captioning methods have made significant progress, the generated captions may not focus on the entity that users are particularly interested in. To address this problem, we propose a new video captioning task, Subject-Oriented Video Captioning (SOVC), which aims to allow users to specify the describing target via a bounding box. To support this task, we construct two subject-oriented video captioning datasets based on two widely used video captioning datasets: MSVD and MSRVTT, by annotating subjects in each video for each caption. These datasets pave the way for describing users' interested targets. To tackle this task, we introduce a method tailored to this task, named SOVCNet. It consists of two key components: a subject-oriented sampling module that samples frames related to the subject to minimize irrelevant information; and a subject-oriented encoding module that utilizes the subject areas as hard prompts and integrates learnable soft prompts, enhancing the model's focus on the subject's activities and facilitating adaptation to the downstream generation task. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on this new task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Nie, Zhiwei He, Xudong Lv, Xueyi Zhou, Dong-Kyu Chae, Fei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Category-specific models are provenly valuable methods in 3D single object tracking (SOT) regardless of Siamese or motion-centric paradigms. However, such over-specialized model designs incur redundant parameters, thus limiting the broader applicability of 3D SOT task. This paper first introduces unified models that can simultaneously track objects across all categories using a single network with shared model parameters. Specifically, we propose to explicitly encode distinct attributes associated to different object categories, enabling the model to adapt to cross-category data. We find that the attribute variances of point cloud objects primarily occur from the varying size and shape (e.g., large and square vehicles v.s. small and slender humans). Based on this observation, we design a novel point set representation learning network inheriting transformer architecture, termed AdaFormer, which adaptively encodes the dynamically varying shape and size information from cross-category data in a unified manner. We further incorporate the size and shape prior derived from the known template targets into the model's inputs and learning objective, facilitating the learning of unified representation. Equipped with such designs, we construct two category-unified models SiamCUT and MoCUT.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiamCUT and MoCUT exhibit strong generalization and training stability. Furthermore, our category-unified models outperform the category-specific counterparts by a significant margin (e.g., on KITTI dataset, 12% and 3% performance gains on the Siamese and motion paradigms). Our code will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchang Ye, Mingyuan Meng, Mingjian Li, Dagan Feng, Usman Naseem, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated medical report generation has the potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with the time-consuming process of medical reporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise in integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation. However, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text generation, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately capturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both visual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation in zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multi-modal dynamic traceback learning framework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to supervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning strategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text generation without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during inference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the model to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Zhu, Kevin Flanagan, Adriano Fragomeni, Michael Wray, Dima Damen</p>
<p>Abstract: Though pre-training vision-language models have demonstrated significant benefits in boosting video-text retrieval performance from large-scale web videos, fine-tuning still plays a critical role with manually annotated clips with start and end times, which requires considerable human effort. To address this issue, we explore an alternative cheaper source of annotations, single timestamps, for video-text retrieval. We initialise clips from timestamps in a heuristic way to warm up a retrieval model. Then a video clip editing method is proposed to refine the initial rough boundaries to improve retrieval performance. A student-teacher network is introduced for video clip editing. The teacher model is employed to edit the clips in the training set whereas the student model trains on the edited clips. The teacher weights are updated from the student's after the student's performance increases. Our method is model agnostic and applicable to any retrieval models. We conduct experiments based on three state-of-the-art retrieval models, COOT, VideoCLIP and CLIP4Clip. Experiments conducted on three video retrieval datasets, YouCook2, DiDeMo and ActivityNet-Captions show that our edited clips consistently improve retrieval performance over initial clips across all the three retrieval models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Alkin, Lukas Miklautz, Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MIM (Masked Image Modeling)-Refiner, a contrastive learning boost for pre-trained MIM models. MIM-Refiner is motivated by the insight that strong representations within MIM models generally reside in intermediate layers. Accordingly, MIM-Refiner leverages multiple contrastive heads that are connected to different intermediate layers. In each head, a modified nearest neighbor objective constructs semantic clusters that capture semantic information which improves performance on downstream tasks, including off-the-shelf and fine-tuning settings.
  The refinement process is short and simple - yet highly effective. Within a few epochs, we refine the features of MIM models from subpar to state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf features. Refining a ViT-H, pre-trained with data2vec 2.0 on ImageNet-1K, sets a new state-of-the-art in linear probing (84.7%) and low-shot classification among models that are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. MIM-Refiner efficiently combines the advantages of MIM and ID objectives and compares favorably against previous state-of-the-art SSL models on a variety of benchmarks such as low-shot classification, long-tailed classification, clustering and semantic segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Outlier detection is an essential capability in safety-critical applications of supervised visual recognition. Most of the existing methods deliver best results by encouraging standard closed-set models to produce low-confidence predictions in negative training data. However, that approach conflates prediction uncertainty with recognition of the negative class. We therefore reconsider direct prediction of K+1 logits that correspond to K groundtruth classes and one outlier class. This setup allows us to formulate a novel anomaly score as an ensemble of in-distribution uncertainty and the posterior of the outlier class which we term negative objectness. Now outliers can be independently detected due to i) high prediction uncertainty or ii) similarity with negative data. We embed our method into a dense prediction architecture with mask-level recognition over K+2 classes. The training procedure encourages the novel K+2-th class to learn negative objectness at pasted negative instances. Our models outperform the current state-of-the art on standard benchmarks for image-wide and pixel-level outlier detection with and without training on real negative data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gao Yu, Qiu Xuchong, Ye Zihan</p>
<p>Abstract: Message hiding, a technique that conceals secret message bits within a cover image, aims to achieve an optimal balance among message capacity, recovery accuracy, and imperceptibility. While convolutional neural networks have notably improved message capacity and imperceptibility, achieving high recovery accuracy remains challenging. This challenge arises because convolutional operations struggle to preserve the sequential order of message bits and effectively address the discrepancy between these two modalities. To address this, we propose StegaFormer, an innovative MLP-based framework designed to preserve bit order and enable global fusion between modalities. Specifically, StegaFormer incorporates three crucial components: Order-Preserving Message Encoder (OPME), Decoder (OPMD) and Global Message-Image Fusion (GMIF). OPME and OPMD aim to preserve the order of message bits by segmenting the entire sequence into equal-length segments and incorporating sequential information during encoding and decoding. Meanwhile, GMIF employs a cross-modality fusion mechanism to effectively fuse the features from the two uncorrelated modalities. Experimental results on the COCO and DIV2K datasets demonstrate that StegaFormer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy, message capacity, and imperceptibility. We will make our code publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human affective behavior analysis aims to delve into human expressions and behaviors to deepen our understanding of human emotions. Basic expression categories (EXPR) and Action Units (AUs) are two essential components in this analysis, which categorize emotions and break down facial movements into elemental units, respectively. Despite advancements, existing approaches in expression classification and AU detection often necessitate complex models and substantial computational resources, limiting their applicability in everyday settings. In this work, we introduce the first lightweight framework adept at efficiently tackling both expression classification and AU detection. This framework employs a frozen CLIP image encoder alongside a trainable multilayer perceptron (MLP), enhanced with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for robustness and a loss landscape flattening strategy for improved generalization. Experimental results on the Aff-wild2 dataset demonstrate superior performance in comparison to the baseline while maintaining minimal computational demands, offering a practical solution for affective behavior analysis.

<p>Abstract: We present a bag of tricks framework for few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL), which is a challenging form of continual learning that involves continuous adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. FSCIL requires both stability and adaptability, i.e., preserving proficiency in previously learned tasks while learning new ones. Our proposed bag of tricks brings together six key and highly influential techniques that improve stability, adaptability, and overall performance under a unified framework for FSCIL. We organize these tricks into three categories: stability tricks, adaptability tricks, and training tricks. Stability tricks aim to mitigate the forgetting of previously learned classes by enhancing the separation between the embeddings of learned classes and minimizing interference when learning new ones. On the other hand, adaptability tricks focus on the effective learning of new classes. Finally, training tricks improve the overall performance without compromising stability or adaptability. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, CIFAR-100, CUB-200, and miniIMageNet, to evaluate the impact of our proposed framework. Our detailed analysis shows that our approach substantially improves both stability and adaptability, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior works in the area. We believe our method provides a go-to solution and establishes a robust baseline for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhang, Huangxuan Zhao, Zhenghong Zhou, Guanjun Wu, Chuansheng Zheng, Xinggang Wang, Wenyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Four-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (4D DSA) is a medical imaging technique that provides a series of 2D images captured at different stages and angles during the process of contrast agent filling blood vessels. It plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Improving the rendering quality and speed under sparse sampling is important for observing the status and location of lesions. The current methods exhibit inadequate rendering quality in sparse views and suffer from slow rendering speed. To overcome these limitations, we propose TOGS, a Gaussian splatting method with opacity offset over time, which can effectively improve the rendering quality and speed of 4D DSA. We introduce an opacity offset table for each Gaussian to model the opacity offsets of the Gaussian, using these opacity-varying Gaussians to model the temporal variations in the radiance of the contrast agent. By interpolating the opacity offset table, the opacity variation of the Gaussian at different time points can be determined. This enables us to render the 2D DSA image at that specific moment. Additionally, we introduced a Smooth loss term in the loss function to mitigate overfitting issues that may arise in the model when dealing with sparse view scenarios. During the training phase, we randomly prune Gaussians, thereby reducing the storage overhead of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods, this model achieves state-of-the-art render quality under the same number of training views. Additionally, it enables real-time rendering while maintaining low storage overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/TOGS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite previous DETR-like methods having performed successfully in generic object detection, tiny object detection is still a challenging task for them since the positional information of object queries is not customized for detecting tiny objects, whose scale is extraordinarily smaller than general objects. Also, DETR-like methods using a fixed number of queries make them unsuitable for aerial datasets, which only contain tiny objects, and the numbers of instances are imbalanced between different images. Thus, we present a simple yet effective model, named DQ-DETR, which consists of three different components: categorical counting module, counting-guided feature enhancement, and dynamic query selection to solve the above-mentioned problems. DQ-DETR uses the prediction and density maps from the categorical counting module to dynamically adjust the number of object queries and improve the positional information of queries. Our model DQ-DETR outperforms previous CNN-based and DETR-like methods, achieving state-of-the-art mAP 30.2% on the AI-TOD-V2 dataset, which mostly consists of tiny objects. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Katie0723/DQ-DETR}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wang, Caixia Yan, Haonan Lin, Weizhan Zhang, Mengmeng Wang, Tieliang Gong, Guang Dai, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image generation. Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed as OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These techniques are later verified to significantly enhance the generation quality. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a 4 times faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid increasing inference time. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we are the first to prove that the semantic space of the diffusion model has the same interpolation property as the latent space does. This property can serve as another promising tool for fine generation control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Santosh, Li Lin, Irene Amerini, Xin Wang, Shu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized image generation, producing high-quality images with applications spanning various fields. However, their ability to create hyper-realistic images poses significant challenges in distinguishing between real and synthetic content, raising concerns about digital authenticity and potential misuse in creating deepfakes. This work introduces a robust detection framework that integrates image and text features extracted by CLIP model with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. We propose a novel loss that can improve the detector's robustness and handle imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we flatten the loss landscape during the model training to improve the detector's generalization capabilities. The effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional detection techniques, is demonstrated through extensive experiments, underscoring its potential to set a new state-of-the-art approach in DM-generated image detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Gadgil, Mahtab Bigverdi</p>
<p>Abstract: AI in dermatology is evolving at a rapid pace but the major limitation to training trustworthy classifiers is the scarcity of data with ground-truth concept level labels, which are meta-labels semantically meaningful to humans. Foundation models like CLIP providing zero-shot capabilities can help alleviate this challenge by leveraging vast amounts of image-caption pairs available on the internet. CLIP can be fine-tuned using domain specific image-caption pairs to improve classification performance. However, CLIP's pre-training data is not well-aligned with the medical jargon that clinicians use to perform diagnoses. The development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has led to the possibility of leveraging the expressive nature of these models to generate rich text. Our goal is to use these models to generate caption text that aligns well with both the clinical lexicon and with the natural human language used in CLIP's pre-training data. Starting with captions used for images in PubMed articles, we extend them by passing the raw captions through an LLM fine-tuned on the field's several textbooks. We find that using captions generated by an expressive fine-tuned LLM like GPT-3.5 improves downstream zero-shot concept classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Li, Xuelin Liu, Xiaoyang Wang, Bu Sung Lee, Shiqi Wang, Anderson Rocha, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to distinguish whether an image is generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial ingredient in human intelligence, usually accompanied by a complex and dialectical forensic and reasoning process. However, current fake image detection models and databases focus on binary classification without understandable explanations for the general populace. This weakens the credibility of authenticity judgment and may conceal potential model biases. Meanwhile, large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited immense visual-text capabilities on various tasks, bringing the potential for explainable fake image detection. Therefore, we pioneer the probe of LMMs for explainable fake image detection by presenting a multimodal database encompassing textual authenticity descriptions, the FakeBench. For construction, we first introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of generative visual forgery concerning human perception, based on which we collect forgery descriptions in human natural language with a human-in-the-loop strategy. FakeBench examines LMMs with four evaluation criteria: detection, reasoning, interpretation and fine-grained forgery analysis, to obtain deeper insights into image authenticity-relevant capabilities. Experiments on various LMMs confirm their merits and demerits in different aspects of fake image detection tasks. This research presents a paradigm shift towards transparency for the fake image detection area and reveals the need for greater emphasis on forensic elements in visual-language research and AI risk control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Zhao, Tianhao Wu, Yu Lai, Zhiliang Tian, Zhen Huang, Yahui Liu, Zejiang He, Dongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable text-to-image generation synthesizes visual text and objects in images with certain conditions, which are frequently applied to emoji and poster generation. Visual text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks have been popular in controllable text-to-image generation. However, each of these tasks typically focuses on single modality generation or rendering, leaving yet-to-be-bridged gaps between the approaches correspondingly designed for each of the tasks. In this paper, we combine text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks into a single task: layout-controllable text-object synthesis (LTOS) task, aiming at synthesizing images with object and visual text based on predefined object layout and text contents. As compliant datasets are not readily available for our LTOS task, we construct a layout-aware text-object synthesis dataset, containing elaborate well-aligned labels of visual text and object information. Based on the dataset, we propose a layout-controllable text-object adaptive fusion (TOF) framework, which generates images with clear, legible visual text and plausible objects. We construct a visual-text rendering module to synthesize text and employ an object-layout control module to generate objects while integrating the two modules to harmoniously generate and integrate text content and objects in images. To better the image-text integration, we propose a self-adaptive cross-attention fusion module that helps the image generation to attend more to important text information. Within such a fusion module, we use a self-adaptive learnable factor to learn to flexibly control the influence of cross-attention outputs on image generation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in LTOS, text rendering, and layout-to-image tasks, enabling harmonious visual text rendering and object generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengfei Wang, Zhongqun Zhang, Yihua Cheng, Hyung Jin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating face image with specific gaze information has attracted considerable attention. Existing approaches typically input gaze values directly for face generation, which is unnatural and requires annotated gaze datasets for training, thereby limiting its application. In this paper, we present a novel gaze-controllable face generation task. Our approach inputs textual descriptions that describe human gaze and head behavior and generates corresponding face images. Our work first introduces a text-of-gaze dataset containing over 90k text descriptions spanning a dense distribution of gaze and head poses. We further propose a gaze-controllable text-to-face method. Our method contains a sketch-conditioned face diffusion module and a model-based sketch diffusion module. We define a face sketch based on facial landmarks and eye segmentation map. The face diffusion module generates face images from the face sketch, and the sketch diffusion module employs a 3D face model to generate face sketch from text description. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset show the effectiveness of our method. We will release our dataset and code for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Gu, Mauro Bellone, Tom\'a\v{s} Pivo\v{n}ka, Raivo Sell</p>
<p>Abstract: Critical research about camera-and-LiDAR-based semantic object segmentation for autonomous driving significantly benefited from the recent development of deep learning. Specifically, the vision transformer is the novel ground-breaker that successfully brought the multi-head-attention mechanism to computer vision applications. Therefore, we propose a vision-transformer-based network to carry out camera-LiDAR fusion for semantic segmentation applied to autonomous driving. Our proposal uses the novel progressive-assemble strategy of vision transformers on a double-direction network and then integrates the results in a cross-fusion strategy over the transformer decoder layers. Unlike other works in the literature, our camera-LiDAR fusion transformers have been evaluated in challenging conditions like rain and low illumination, showing robust performance. The paper reports the segmentation results over the vehicle and human classes in different modalities: camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. We perform coherent controlled benchmark experiments of CLFT against other networks that are also designed for semantic segmentation. The experiments aim to evaluate the performance of CLFT independently from two perspectives: multimodal sensor fusion and backbone architectures. The quantitative assessments show our CLFT networks yield an improvement of up to 10% for challenging dark-wet conditions when comparing with Fully-Convolutional-Neural-Network-based (FCN) camera-LiDAR fusion neural network. Contrasting to the network with transformer backbone but using single modality input, the all-around improvement is 5-10%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiong Huang, Xinying Wang, Chengpei Xu, Jinjiang Li, Lin Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater scenes intrinsically involve degradation problems owing to heterogeneous ocean elements. Prevailing underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods stick to straightforward feature modeling to learn the mapping function, which leads to limited vision gain as it lacks more explicit physical cues (e.g., depth). In this work, we investigate injecting the depth prior into the deep UIE model for more precise scene enhancement capability. To this end, we present a novel depth-guided perception UIE framework, dubbed underwater variable zoom (UVZ). Specifically, UVZ resorts to a two-stage pipeline. First, a depth estimation network is designed to generate critical depth maps, combined with an auxiliary supervision network introduced to suppress estimation differences during training. Second, UVZ parses near-far scenarios by harnessing the predicted depth maps, enabling local and non-local perceiving in different regions. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that UVZ achieves superior visual gain and delivers promising quantitative metrics. Besides, UVZ is confirmed to exhibit good generalization in some visual tasks, especially in unusual lighting conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anudeep Das, Vasisht Duddu, Rui Zhang, N. Asokan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion based text-to-image models are trained on large datasets scraped from the Internet, potentially containing unacceptable concepts (e.g., copyright infringing or unsafe). We need concept removal techniques (CRTs) which are effective in preventing the generation of images with unacceptable concepts, utility-preserving on acceptable concepts, and robust against evasion with adversarial prompts. None of the prior CRTs satisfy all these requirements simultaneously. We introduce Espresso, the first robust concept filter based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). We configure CLIP to identify unacceptable concepts in generated images using the distance of their embeddings to the text embeddings of both unacceptable and acceptable concepts. This lets us fine-tune for robustness by separating the text embeddings of unacceptable and acceptable concepts while preserving their pairing with image embeddings for utility. We present a pipeline to evaluate various CRTs, attacks against them, and show that Espresso, is more effective and robust than prior CRTs, while retaining utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario D\"obler, Robert A. Marsden, Tobias Raichle, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, maintaining model robustness against distribution shifts is critical. This work explores a broad range of possibilities to adapt vision-language foundation models at test-time, with a particular emphasis on CLIP and its variants. The study systematically examines prompt-based techniques and existing test-time adaptation methods, aiming to improve the robustness under distribution shift in diverse real-world scenarios. Specifically, the investigation covers various prompt engineering strategies, including handcrafted prompts, prompt ensembles, and prompt learning techniques. Additionally, we introduce a vision-text-space ensemble that substantially enhances average performance compared to text-space-only ensembles. Since online test-time adaptation has shown to be effective to mitigate performance drops under distribution shift, the study extends its scope to evaluate the effectiveness of existing test-time adaptation methods that were originally designed for vision-only classification models. Through extensive experimental evaluations conducted across multiple datasets and diverse model architectures, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of these adaptation strategies.

<p>Abstract: Neural implicit representations have recently demonstrated considerable potential in the field of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This is due to their inherent advantages, including low storage overhead and representation continuity. However, these methods necessitate the size of the scene as input, which is impractical for unknown scenes. Consequently, we propose NeB-SLAM, a neural block-based scalable RGB-D SLAM for unknown scenes. Specifically, we first propose a divide-and-conquer mapping strategy that represents the entire unknown scene as a set of sub-maps. These sub-maps are a set of neural blocks of fixed size. Then, we introduce an adaptive map growth strategy to achieve adaptive allocation of neural blocks during camera tracking and gradually cover the whole unknown scene. Finally, extensive evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in both mapping and tracking when targeting unknown environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiting Dong, Xiang He, Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Yang Li, Yi Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capture event data with high temporal resolution and low power consumption, presenting a more efficient solution for visual processing in dynamic and real-time scenarios compared to conventional video capture methods. Event data augmentation serve as an essential method for overcoming the limitation of scale and diversity in event datasets. Our comparative experiments demonstrate that the two factors, spatial integrity and temporal continuity, can significantly affect the capacity of event data augmentation, which are guarantee for maintaining the sparsity and high dynamic range characteristics unique to event data. However, existing augmentation methods often neglect the preservation of spatial integrity and temporal continuity. To address this, we developed a novel event data augmentation strategy EventZoom, which employs a temporal progressive strategy, embedding transformed samples into the original samples through progressive scaling and shifting. The scaling process avoids the spatial information loss associated with cropping, while the progressive strategy prevents interruptions or abrupt changes in temporal information. We validated EventZoom across various supervised learning frameworks. The experimental results show that EventZoom consistently outperforms existing event data augmentation methods with SOTA performance. For the first time, we have concurrently employed Semi-supervised and Unsupervised learning to verify feasibility on event augmentation algorithms, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of EventZoom as a powerful event-based data augmentation tool in handling real-world scenes with high dynamics and variability environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omri Avrahami, Rinon Gal, Gal Chechik, Ohad Fried, Dani Lischinski, Arash Vahdat, Weili Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have proven effective for solving many image editing tasks. However, the seemingly straightforward task of seamlessly relocating objects within a scene remains surprisingly challenging. Existing methods addressing this problem often struggle to function reliably in real-world scenarios due to lacking spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose a training-free method, dubbed DiffUHaul, that harnesses the spatial understanding of a localized text-to-image model, for the object dragging task. Blindly manipulating layout inputs of the localized model tends to cause low editing performance due to the intrinsic entanglement of object representation in the model. To this end, we first apply attention masking in each denoising step to make the generation more disentangled across different objects and adopt the self-attention sharing mechanism to preserve the high-level object appearance. Furthermore, we propose a new diffusion anchoring technique: in the early denoising steps, we interpolate the attention features between source and target images to smoothly fuse new layouts with the original appearance; in the later denoising steps, we pass the localized features from the source images to the interpolated images to retain fine-grained object details. To adapt DiffUHaul to real-image editing, we apply a DDPM self-attention bucketing that can better reconstruct real images with the localized model. Finally, we introduce an automated evaluation pipeline for this task and showcase the efficacy of our method. Our results are reinforced through a user preference study.</p>

We train on different configurations of the proposed hard negative mining approach, and we evaluate the accuracy of our models in 3D classification and on the cross-modal retrieval benchmark, testing image-to-shape and shape-to-image retrieval. Results demonstrate that our approach, even without explicit text alignment, achieves comparable or superior performance on zero-shot and standard 3D classification, while significantly improving both image-to-shape and shape-to-image retrieval compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yao, Ming Liu, Haolin Wang, Zhicun Yin, Zifei Yan, Xiaopeng Hong, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance on unsupervised anomaly detection tasks. Since trained with normal data only, diffusion models tend to reconstruct normal counterparts of test images with certain noises added. However, these methods treat all potential anomalies equally, which may cause two main problems. From the global perspective, the difficulty of reconstructing images with different anomalies is uneven. Therefore, instead of utilizing the same setting for all samples, we propose to predict a particular denoising step for each sample by evaluating the difference between image contents and the priors extracted from diffusion models. From the local perspective, reconstructing abnormal regions differs from normal areas even in the same image. Theoretically, the diffusion model predicts a noise for each step, typically following a standard Gaussian distribution. However, due to the difference between the anomaly and its potential normal counterpart, the predicted noise in abnormal regions will inevitably deviate from the standard Gaussian distribution. To this end, we propose introducing synthetic abnormal samples in training to encourage the diffusion models to break through the limitation of standard Gaussian distribution, and a spatial-adaptive feature fusion scheme is utilized during inference. With the above modifications, we propose a global and local adaptive diffusion model (abbreviated to GLAD) for unsupervised anomaly detection, which introduces appealing flexibility and achieves anomaly-free reconstruction while retaining as much normal information as possible. Extensive experiments are conducted on three commonly used anomaly detection datasets (MVTec-AD, MPDD, and VisA) and a printed circuit board dataset (PCB-Bank) we integrated, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have made substantial progress in generating images from textual prompts. However, they frequently fail to produce images consistent with physical commonsense, a vital capability for applications in world simulation and everyday tasks. Current T2I evaluation benchmarks focus on metrics such as accuracy, bias, and safety, neglecting the evaluation of models' internal knowledge, particularly physical commonsense. To address this issue, we introduce PhyBench, a comprehensive T2I evaluation dataset comprising 700 prompts across 4 primary categories: mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, and material properties, encompassing 31 distinct physical scenarios. We assess 6 prominent T2I models, including proprietary models DALLE3 and Gemini, and demonstrate that incorporating physical principles into prompts enhances the models' ability to generate physically accurate images. Our findings reveal that: (1) even advanced models frequently err in various physical scenarios, except for optics; (2) GPT-4o, with item-specific scoring instructions, effectively evaluates the models' understanding of physical commonsense, closely aligning with human assessments; and (3) current T2I models are primarily focused on text-to-image translation, lacking profound reasoning regarding physical commonsense. We advocate for increased attention to the inherent knowledge within T2I models, beyond their utility as mere image generation tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Hosseini, Amirhossein Kazerouni, Saeed Akhavan, Michael Brudno, Babak Taati</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual attention modeling, important for interpreting and prioritizing visual stimuli, plays a significant role in applications such as marketing, multimedia, and robotics. Traditional saliency prediction models, especially those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, achieve notable success by leveraging large-scale annotated datasets. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models that use Transformers are computationally expensive. Additionally, separate models are often required for each image type, lacking a unified approach. In this paper, we propose Saliency Unification through Mamba (SUM), a novel approach that integrates the efficient long-range dependency modeling of Mamba with U-Net to provide a unified model for diverse image types. Using a novel Conditional Visual State Space (C-VSS) block, SUM dynamically adapts to various image types, including natural scenes, web pages, and commercial imagery, ensuring universal applicability across different data types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Chen, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The unique complementarity of frame-based and event cameras for high frame rate object tracking has recently inspired some research attempts to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, no interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features for better interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Gating to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that fine-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to improve interaction and discriminability between the target information and background. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Ramachandran, Souvik Kundu, Tushar Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CLAMP-ViT, a data-free post-training quantization method for vision transformers (ViTs). We identify the limitations of recent techniques, notably their inability to leverage meaningful inter-patch relationships, leading to the generation of simplistic and semantically vague data, impacting quantization accuracy. CLAMP-ViT employs a two-stage approach, cyclically adapting between data generation and model quantization. Specifically, we incorporate a patch-level contrastive learning scheme to generate richer, semantically meaningful data. Furthermore, we leverage contrastive learning in layer-wise evolutionary search for fixed- and mixed-precision quantization to identify optimal quantization parameters while mitigating the effects of a non-smooth loss landscape. Extensive evaluations across various vision tasks demonstrate the superiority of CLAMP-ViT, with performance improvements of up to 3% in top-1 accuracy for classification, 0.6 mAP for object detection, and 1.5 mIoU for segmentation at similar or better compression ratio over existing alternatives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Miao, Yifan Zhu, Yinpeng Dong, Lijia Yu, Jun Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts and jailbreak attack-based prompts. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqin Jiang, Chaohui Yu, Chenjie Cao, Fan Wang, Weiming Hu, Jin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 4D generation mainly focus on generating 4D content by distilling pre-trained text or single-view image-conditioned models. It is inconvenient for them to take advantage of various off-the-shelf 3D assets with multi-view attributes, and their results suffer from spatiotemporal inconsistency owing to the inherent ambiguity in the supervision signals. In this work, we present Animate3D, a novel framework for animating any static 3D model. The core idea is two-fold: 1) We propose a novel multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) conditioned on multi-view renderings of the static 3D object, which is trained on our presented large-scale multi-view video dataset (MV-Video). 2) Based on MV-VDM, we introduce a framework combining reconstruction and 4D Score Distillation Sampling (4D-SDS) to leverage the multi-view video diffusion priors for animating 3D objects. Specifically, for MV-VDM, we design a new spatiotemporal attention module to enhance spatial and temporal consistency by integrating 3D and video diffusion models. Additionally, we leverage the static 3D model's multi-view renderings as conditions to preserve its identity. For animating 3D models, an effective two-stage pipeline is proposed: we first reconstruct motions directly from generated multi-view videos, followed by the introduced 4D-SDS to refine both appearance and motion. Benefiting from accurate motion learning, we could achieve straightforward mesh animation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Animate3D significantly outperforms previous approaches. Data, code, and models will be open-released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengcong Fei, Mingyuan Fan, Changqian Yu, Debang Li, Junshi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present DiT-MoE, a sparse version of the diffusion Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with dense networks while exhibiting highly optimized inference. The DiT-MoE includes two simple designs: shared expert routing and expert-level balance loss, thereby capturing common knowledge and reducing redundancy among the different routed experts. When applied to conditional image generation, a deep analysis of experts specialization gains some interesting observations: (i) Expert selection shows preference with spatial position and denoising time step, while insensitive with different class-conditional information; (ii) As the MoE layers go deeper, the selection of experts gradually shifts from specific spacial position to dispersion and balance. (iii) Expert specialization tends to be more concentrated at the early time step and then gradually uniform after half. We attribute it to the diffusion process that first models the low-frequency spatial information and then high-frequency complex information. Based on the above guidance, a series of DiT-MoE experimentally achieves performance on par with dense networks yet requires much less computational load during inference. More encouragingly, we demonstrate the potential of DiT-MoE with synthesized image data, scaling diffusion model at a 16.5B parameter that attains a new SoTA FID-50K score of 1.80 in 512$\times$512 resolution settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring the knowledge from one neural network to another, often from a larger, well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student). Traditional KD methods minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the teacher and student networks. However, this approach often overlooks crucial structural knowledge embedded within the teacher's network. In this paper, we introduce Invariant Consistency Distillation (ICD), a novel methodology designed to enhance KD by ensuring that the student model's representations are both discriminative and invariant with respect to the teacher's outputs. Our approach is based on causal inference principles and combines contrastive learning with an explicit invariance penalty, capturing significantly more information from the teacher's representation. ICD uses an efficient, parameter-free approach for flexible teacher-student alignment. We provide a theoretical foundation for ICD and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 show that ICD outperforms traditional KD techniques and surpasses state-of-the-art methods. In some cases, the student model even exceeds the teacher model in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully apply our method to other datasets, such as Tiny ImageNet and STL-10, demonstrating superior cross-dataset generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Ma, Peiwen Sun, Yaoting Wang, Di Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to achieve pixel-level localization of sound sources in videos, while Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation (AVSS), as an extension of AVS, further pursues semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes. However, since the AVSS task requires the establishment of audio-visual correspondence and semantic understanding simultaneously, we observe that previous methods have struggled to handle this mashup of objectives in end-to-end training, resulting in insufficient learning and sub-optimization. Therefore, we propose a two-stage training strategy called \textit{Stepping Stones}, which decomposes the AVSS task into two simple subtasks from localization to semantic understanding, which are fully optimized in each stage to achieve step-by-step global optimization. This training strategy has also proved its generalization and effectiveness on existing methods. To further improve the performance of AVS tasks, we propose a novel framework Adaptive Audio Visual Segmentation, in which we incorporate an adaptive audio query generator and integrate masked attention into the transformer decoder, facilitating the adaptive fusion of visual and audio features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on all three AVS benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for transferring knowledge from a large, well-trained teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Despite its success, one of the main challenges in KD is ensuring the efficient transfer of complex knowledge while maintaining the student's computational efficiency. Unlike previous works that applied contrastive objectives promoting explicit negative instances with little attention to the relationships between them, we introduce Relational Representation Distillation (RRD). Our approach leverages pairwise similarities to explore and reinforce the relationships between the teacher and student models. Inspired by self-supervised learning principles, it uses a relaxed contrastive loss that focuses on similarity rather than exact replication. This method aligns the output distributions of teacher samples in a large memory buffer, improving the robustness and performance of the student model without the need for strict negative instance differentiation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC-2012, outperforming traditional KD and sometimes even outperforms the teacher network when combined with KD. It also transfers successfully to other datasets like Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. Code is available at https://github.com/giakoumoglou/distillers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Head-mounted 360{\deg} displays and portable 360{\deg} cameras have significantly progressed, providing viewers a realistic and immersive experience. However, many omnidirectional videos have low frame rates that can lead to visual fatigue, and the prevailing plane frame interpolation methodologies are unsuitable for omnidirectional video interpolation because they are designed solely for traditional videos. This paper introduces the benchmark dataset, 360VFI, for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. We present a practical implementation that introduces a distortion prior from omnidirectional video into the network to modulate distortions. Specifically, we propose a pyramid distortion-sensitive feature extractor that uses the unique characteristics of equirectangular projection (ERP) format as prior information. Moreover, we devise a decoder that uses an affine transformation to further facilitate the synthesis of intermediate frames. 360VFI is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. Through our benchmark analysis, we present four different distortion condition scenes in the proposed 360VFI dataset to evaluate the challenges triggered by distortion during interpolation. Besides, experimental results demonstrate that Omnidirectional Video Interpolation can be effectively improved by modeling for omnidirectional distortion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently demonstrated significant efficiency in the reconstruction of three-dimensional scenes and the synthesis of novel perspectives from a limited set of two-dimensional images. However, large-scale reconstruction using NeRF requires a substantial amount of aerial imagery for training, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces an innovative incremental optimal view selection framework, IOVS4NeRF, designed to model a 3D scene within a restricted input budget. Specifically, our approach involves adding the existing training set with newly acquired samples, guided by a computed novel hybrid uncertainty of candidate views, which integrates rendering uncertainty and positional uncertainty. By selecting views that offer the highest information gain, the quality of novel view synthesis can be enhanced with minimal additional resources. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the efficiency of our model in realistic scenes, outperforming baselines and similar prior works, particularly under conditions of sparse training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of Continual Category Discovery (CCD), which aims to automatically discover novel categories in a continuous stream of unlabeled data while mitigating the challenge of catastrophic forgetting -- an open problem that persists even in conventional, fully supervised continual learning. To address this challenge, we propose PromptCCD, a simple yet effective framework that utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a prompting method for CCD. At the core of PromptCCD lies the Gaussian Mixture Prompting (GMP) module, which acts as a dynamic pool that updates over time to facilitate representation learning and prevent forgetting during category discovery. Moreover, GMP enables on-the-fly estimation of category numbers, allowing PromptCCD to discover categories in unlabeled data without prior knowledge of the category numbers. We extend the standard evaluation metric for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) to CCD and benchmark state-of-the-art methods on diverse public datasets. PromptCCD significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/promptccd .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Yang, Yingqi Deng, Jing Zhang, Hongjie Gu, Zhekang Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current 3D single object tracking methods primarily rely on the Siamese matching-based paradigm, which struggles with textureless and incomplete LiDAR point clouds. Conversely, the motion-centric paradigm avoids appearance matching, thus overcoming these issues. However, its complex multi-stage pipeline and the limited temporal modeling capability of a single-stream architecture constrain its potential. In this paper, we introduce SiamMo, a novel and simple Siamese motion-centric tracking approach. Unlike the traditional single-stream architecture, we employ Siamese feature extraction for motion-centric tracking. This decouples feature extraction from temporal fusion, significantly enhancing tracking performance. Additionally, we design a Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation module to integrate Siamese features at multiple scales, capturing motion information effectively. We also introduce a Box-aware Feature Encoding module to encode object size priors into motion estimation. SiamMo is a purely motion-centric tracker that eliminates the need for additional processes like segmentation and box refinement. Without whistles and bells, SiamMo not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in challenging scenarios. SiamMo sets a new record on the KITTI tracking benchmark with 90.1\% precision while maintaining a high inference speed of 108 FPS.

<p>Abstract: Clinically deployed deep learning-based segmentation models are known to fail on data outside of their training distributions. While clinicians review the segmentations, these models tend to perform well in most instances, which could exacerbate automation bias. Therefore, detecting out-of-distribution images at inference is critical to warn the clinicians that the model likely failed. This work applied the Mahalanobis distance (MD) post hoc to the bottleneck features of four Swin UNETR and nnU-net models that segmented the liver on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. By reducing the dimensions of the bottleneck features with either principal component analysis or uniform manifold approximation and projection, images the models failed on were detected with high performance and minimal computational load. In addition, this work explored a non-parametric alternative to the MD, a k-th nearest neighbors distance (KNN). KNN drastically improved scalability and performance over MD when both were applied to raw and average-pooled bottleneck features.</p>

<p>Abstract: The customization of text-to-image models has seen significant advancements, yet generating multiple personalized concepts remains a challenging task. Current methods struggle with attribute leakage and layout confusion when handling multiple concepts, leading to reduced concept fidelity and semantic consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free framework, Concept Conductor, designed to ensure visual fidelity and correct layout in multi-concept customization. Concept Conductor isolates the sampling processes of multiple custom models to prevent attribute leakage between different concepts and corrects erroneous layouts through self-attention-based spatial guidance. Additionally, we present a concept injection technique that employs shape-aware masks to specify the generation area for each concept. This technique injects the structure and appearance of personalized concepts through feature fusion in the attention layers, ensuring harmony in the final image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Concept Conductor can consistently generate composite images with accurate layouts while preserving the visual details of each concept. Compared to existing baselines, Concept Conductor shows significant performance improvements. Our method supports the combination of any number of concepts and maintains high fidelity even when dealing with visually similar concepts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huafeng Qin, Yuming Fu, Jing Chen, Mounim A. El-Yacoubi, Xinbo Gao, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the advantages such as high security, high privacy, and liveness recognition, vein recognition has been received more and more attention in past years. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., Mamba has shown robust feature representation with linear computational complexity and successfully applied for visual tasks. However, vision Manba can capture long-distance feature dependencies but unfortunately deteriorate local feature details. Besides, manually designing a Mamba architecture based on human priori knowledge is very time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, first, we propose a hybrid network structure named Global-local Vision Mamba (GLVM), to learn the local correlations in images explicitly and global dependencies among tokens for vein feature representation. Secondly, we design a Multi-head Mamba to learn the dependencies along different directions, so as to improve the feature representation ability of vision Mamba. Thirdly, to learn the complementary features, we propose a ConvMamba block consisting of three branches, named Multi-head Mamba branch (MHMamba), Feature Iteration Unit branch (FIU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branch, where the Feature Iteration Unit branch aims to fuse convolutional local features with Mamba-based global representations. Finally, a Globallocal Alternate Neural Architecture Search (GLNAS) method is proposed to search the optimal architecture of GLVM alternately with the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the recognition performance for vein recognition tasks. We conduct rigorous experiments on three public palm-vein databases to estimate the performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the representative approaches and achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations change through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations changes through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that how ID changes through the network differs noticeably between natural and medical image models. Specifically, medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Li, Jinhua Yu, Dairong Chen, Yi Lin, Runmin Dong, Xiang Zhang, Conghui He, Haohuan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a geometry-aware semi-supervised framework for fine-grained building function recognition, utilizing geometric relationships among multi-source data to enhance pseudo-label accuracy in semi-supervised learning, broadening its applicability to various building function categorization systems. Firstly, we design an online semi-supervised pre-training stage, which facilitates the precise acquisition of building facade location information in street-view images. In the second stage, we propose a geometry-aware coarse annotation generation module. This module effectively combines GIS data and street-view data based on the geometric relationships, improving the accuracy of pseudo annotations. In the third stage, we combine the newly generated coarse annotations with the existing labeled dataset to achieve fine-grained functional recognition of buildings across multiple cities at a large scale. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits superior performance in fine-grained functional recognition of buildings. Within the same categorization system, it achieves improvements of 7.6\% and 4.8\% compared to fully-supervised methods and state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, respectively. Additionally, our method also performs well in cross-city scenarios, i.e., extending the model trained on OmniCity (New York) to new cities (i.e., Los Angeles and Boston) with different building function categorization systems. This study offers a new solution for large-scale multi-city applications with minimal annotation requirements, facilitating more efficient data updates and resource allocation in urban management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoning Wu, Shaocheng Shen, Qiang Hu, Xiaoyun Zhang, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as frontrunners in text-to-image generation, however, their fixed image resolution during training often leads to challenges in high-resolution image generation, such as semantic deviations and object replication. This paper introduces MegaFusion, a novel approach that extends existing diffusion-based text-to-image generation models towards efficient higher-resolution generation without additional fine-tuning or extra adaptation. Specifically, we employ an innovative truncate and relay strategy to bridge the denoising processes across different resolutions, allowing for high-resolution image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, by integrating dilated convolutions and noise re-scheduling, we further adapt the model's priors for higher resolution. The versatility and efficacy of MegaFusion make it universally applicable to both latent-space and pixel-space diffusion models, along with other derivative models. Extensive experiments confirm that MegaFusion significantly boosts the capability of existing models to produce images of megapixels and various aspect ratios, while only requiring about 40% of the original computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Kim, Miso Lee, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal action detection (TAD) is challenging, yet fundamental for real-world video applications. Recently, DETR-based models for TAD have been prevailing thanks to their unique benefits. However, transformers demand a huge dataset, and unfortunately data scarcity in TAD causes a severe degeneration. In this paper, we identify two crucial problems from data scarcity: attention collapse and imbalanced performance. To this end, we propose a new pre-training strategy, Long-Term Pre-training (LTP), tailored for transformers. LTP has two main components: 1) class-wise synthesis, 2) long-term pretext tasks. Firstly, we synthesize long-form video features by merging video snippets of a target class and non-target classes. They are analogous to untrimmed data used in TAD, despite being created from trimmed data. In addition, we devise two types of long-term pretext tasks to learn long-term dependency. They impose long-term conditions such as finding second-to-fourth or short-duration actions. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performances in DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14 by a large margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that LTP significantly relieves the data scarcity issues in TAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqing Zhang, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds are crucial for capturing three-dimensional data but often suffer from incompleteness due to limitations such as resolution and occlusion. Traditional methods typically rely on point-based approaches within discriminative frameworks for point cloud completion. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Diffusion-Occ}, a novel framework for Diffusion Point Cloud Completion. Diffusion-Occ utilizes a two-stage coarse-to-fine approach. In the first stage, the Coarse Density Voxel Prediction Network (CDNet) processes partial points to predict coarse density voxels, streamlining global feature extraction through voxel classification, as opposed to previous regression-based methods. In the second stage, we introduce the Occupancy Generation Network (OccGen), a conditional occupancy diffusion model based on a transformer architecture and enhanced by our Point-Voxel Fuse (PVF) block. This block integrates coarse density voxels with partial points to leverage both global and local features for comprehensive completion. By thresholding the occupancy field, we convert it into a complete point cloud. Additionally, our method employs diverse training mixtures and efficient diffusion parameterization to enable effective one-step sampling during both training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that Diffusion-Occ outperforms existing discriminative and generative methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuncheng Yang, Yulei Qin, Tong Wu, Zihan Xu, Gang Li, Pengcheng Guo, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Jie Yang, Yun Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The cultivation of expertise for large language models (LLMs) to solve tasks of specific areas often requires special-purpose tuning with calibrated behaviors on the expected stable outputs. To avoid huge cost brought by manual preparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of hours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank adaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting point. However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the performance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap exposed in domain-specific deployment. In the present study, we propose to bridge such gap by introducing few human-annotated samples (i.e., K-shot) for advancing task expertise of LLMs with open knowledge. Specifically, we develop an efficient and scalable pipeline to cost-efficiently produce task experts where K-shot data intervene in selecting the most promising expert candidates and the task-relevant instructions. A mixture-of-expert (MoE) system is built to make the best use of individual-yet-complementary knowledge between multiple experts. We unveil the two keys to the success of a MoE system, 1) the abidance by K-shot, and 2) the insistence on diversity. For the former, we ensure that models that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected rather than those blind guessers. Besides, during data selection, instructions that share task-relevant contexts with K-shot are prioritized. For the latter, we highlight the diversity of constituting experts and that of the fine-tuning instructions throughout the model and data selection process. Extensive experimental results confirm the superiority of our approach over existing methods on utilization of open knowledge across various tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Kim, Miso Lee, Cheol-Ho Cho, Jihyun Lee, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is fundamental yet challenging for real-world video applications. Leveraging the unique benefits of transformers, various DETR-based approaches have been adopted in TAD. However, it has recently been identified that the attention collapse in self-attention causes the performance degradation of DETR for TAD. Building upon previous research, this paper newly addresses the attention collapse problem in cross-attention within DETR-based TAD methods. Moreover, our findings reveal that cross-attention exhibits patterns distinct from predictions, indicating a short-cut phenomenon. To resolve this, we propose a new framework, Prediction-Feedback DETR (Pred-DETR), which utilizes predictions to restore the collapse and align the cross- and self-attention with predictions. Specifically, we devise novel prediction-feedback objectives using guidance from the relations of the predictions. As a result, Pred-DETR significantly alleviates the collapse and achieves state-of-the-art performance among DETR-based methods on various challenging benchmarks including THUMOS14, ActivityNet-v1.3, HACS, and FineAction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video action localization aims to find timings of a specific action from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, those require annotating videos that come with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a learning-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLM). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames into a concatenated image with frame index labels, making a VLM guess a frame that is considered to be closest to the start/end of the action. Iterating this process by narrowing a sampling time window results in finding a specific frame of start and end of an action. We demonstrate that this sampling technique yields reasonable results, illustrating a practical extension of VLMs for understanding videos. A sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liuhan Chen, Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Bin Zhu, Qian Wang, Shenghai Yuan, Xing Zhou, Xinhua Cheng, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational Autoencoder (VAE), compressing videos into latent representations, is a crucial preceding component of Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs). With the same reconstruction quality, the more sufficient the VAE's compression for videos is, the more efficient the LVDMs are. However, most LVDMs utilize 2D image VAE, whose compression for videos is only in the spatial dimension and often ignored in the temporal dimension. How to conduct temporal compression for videos in a VAE to obtain more concise latent representations while promising accurate reconstruction is seldom explored. To fill this gap, we propose an omni-dimension compression VAE, named OD-VAE, which can temporally and spatially compress videos. Although OD-VAE's more sufficient compression brings a great challenge to video reconstruction, it can still achieve high reconstructed accuracy by our fine design. To obtain a better trade-off between video reconstruction quality and compression speed, four variants of OD-VAE are introduced and analyzed. In addition, a novel tail initialization is designed to train OD-VAE more efficiently, and a novel inference strategy is proposed to enable OD-VAE to handle videos of arbitrary length with limited GPU memory. Comprehensive experiments on video reconstruction and LVDM-based video generation demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vadim Titov, Madina Khalmatova, Alexandra Ivanova, Dmitry Vetrov, Aibek Alanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generative models, manipulating real images with these models remains a challenging problem. The main limitations of existing editing methods are that they either fail to perform with consistent quality on a wide range of image edits or require time-consuming hyperparameter tuning or fine-tuning of the diffusion model to preserve the image-specific appearance of the input image. We propose a novel approach that is built upon a modified diffusion sampling process via the guidance mechanism. In this work, we explore the self-guidance technique to preserve the overall structure of the input image and its local regions appearance that should not be edited. In particular, we explicitly introduce layout-preserving energy functions that are aimed to save local and global structures of the source image. Additionally, we propose a noise rescaling mechanism that allows to preserve noise distribution by balancing the norms of classifier-free guidance and our proposed guiders during generation. Such a guiding approach does not require fine-tuning the diffusion model and exact inversion process. As a result, the proposed method provides a fast and high-quality editing mechanism. In our experiments, we show through human evaluation and quantitative analysis that the proposed method allows to produce desired editing which is more preferable by humans and also achieves a better trade-off between editing quality and preservation of the original image.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avraham Chapman, Haiming Xu, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a fine-grained image recognition model with limited data presents a significant challenge, as the subtle differences between categories may not be easily discernible amidst distracting noise patterns. One commonly employed strategy is to leverage pretrained neural networks, which can generate effective feature representations for constructing an image classification model with a restricted dataset. However, these pretrained neural networks are typically trained for different tasks than the fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) task at hand, which can lead to the extraction of less relevant features. Moreover, in the context of building FGVR models with limited data, these irrelevant features can dominate the training process, overshadowing more useful, generalizable discriminative features. Our research has identified a surprisingly simple solution to this challenge: we introduce a regularization technique to ensure that the magnitudes of the extracted features are evenly distributed. This regularization is achieved by maximizing the uniformity of feature magnitude distribution, measured through the entropy of the normalized features. The motivation behind this regularization is to remove bias in feature magnitudes from pretrained models, where some features may be more prominent and, consequently, more likely to be used for classification. Additionally, we have developed a dynamic weighting mechanism to adjust the strength of this regularization throughout the learning process. Despite its apparent simplicity, our approach has demonstrated significant performance improvements across various fine-grained visual recognition datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumitri Chattopadhyay, Sanket Biswas, Emanuele Vivoli, Josep Llad\'os</p>
<p>Abstract: Although foundational vision-language models (VLMs) have proven to be very successful for various semantic discrimination tasks, they still struggle to perform faithfully for fine-grained categorization. Moreover, foundational models trained on one domain do not generalize well on a different domain without fine-tuning. We attribute these to the limitations of the VLM's semantic representations and attempt to improve their fine-grained visual awareness using generative modeling. Specifically, we propose two novel methods: Generative Class Prompt Learning (GCPL) and Contrastive Multi-class Prompt Learning (CoMPLe). Utilizing text-to-image diffusion models, GCPL significantly improves the visio-linguistic synergy in class embeddings by conditioning on few-shot exemplars with learnable class prompts. CoMPLe builds on this foundation by introducing a contrastive learning component that encourages inter-class separation during the generative optimization process. Our empirical results demonstrate that such a generative class prompt learning approach substantially outperform existing methods, offering a better alternative to few shot image recognition challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Chen, Minkyu Choi, Zesen Zhao, Kuan Han, Qing Qu, Zhongming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Taking inspiration from physical motion, we present a new self-supervised dynamics learning strategy for videos: Video Time-Differentiation for Instance Discrimination (ViDiDi). ViDiDi is a simple and data-efficient strategy, readily applicable to existing self-supervised video representation learning frameworks based on instance discrimination. At its core, ViDiDi observes different aspects of a video through various orders of temporal derivatives of its frame sequence. These derivatives, along with the original frames, support the Taylor series expansion of the underlying continuous dynamics at discrete times, where higher-order derivatives emphasize higher-order motion features. ViDiDi learns a single neural network that encodes a video and its temporal derivatives into consistent embeddings following a balanced alternating learning algorithm. By learning consistent representations for original frames and derivatives, the encoder is steered to emphasize motion features over static backgrounds and uncover the hidden dynamics in original frames. Hence, video representations are better separated by dynamic features. We integrate ViDiDi into existing instance discrimination frameworks (VICReg, BYOL, and SimCLR) for pretraining on UCF101 or Kinetics and test on standard benchmarks including video retrieval, action recognition, and action detection. The performances are enhanced by a significant margin without the need for large models or extensive datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Liu, Yingqing He, Lanqing Guo, Xiang Li, Bu Jin, Peng Li, Yan Li, Chi-Min Chan, Qifeng Chen, Wei Xue, Wenhan Luo, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The potential for higher-resolution image generation using pretrained diffusion models is immense, yet these models often struggle with issues of object repetition and structural artifacts especially when scaling to 4K resolution and higher. We figure out that the problem is caused by that, a single prompt for the generation of multiple scales provides insufficient efficacy. In response, we propose HiPrompt, a new tuning-free solution that tackles the above problems by introducing hierarchical prompts. The hierarchical prompts offer both global and local guidance. Specifically, the global guidance comes from the user input that describes the overall content, while the local guidance utilizes patch-wise descriptions from MLLMs to elaborately guide the regional structure and texture generation. Furthermore, during the inverse denoising process, the generated noise is decomposed into low- and high-frequency spatial components. These components are conditioned on multiple prompt levels, including detailed patch-wise descriptions and broader image-level prompts, facilitating prompt-guided denoising under hierarchical semantic guidance. It further allows the generation to focus more on local spatial regions and ensures the generated images maintain coherent local and global semantics, structures, and textures with high definition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art works in higher-resolution image generation, significantly reducing object repetition and enhancing structural quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodel Large Language Models(MLLMs) have achieved promising OCR-free Document Understanding performance by increasing the supported resolution of document images. However, this comes at the cost of generating thousands of visual tokens for a single document image, leading to excessive GPU memory and slower inference times, particularly in multi-page document comprehension. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose a High-resolution DocCompressor module to compress each high-resolution document image into 324 tokens, guided by low-resolution global visual features. With this compression module, to strengthen multi-page document comprehension ability and balance both token efficiency and question-answering performance, we develop the DocOwl2 under a three-stage training framework: Single-image Pretraining, Multi-image Continue-pretraining, and Multi-task Finetuning. DocOwl2 sets a new state-of-the-art across multi-page document understanding benchmarks and reduces first token latency by more than 50%, demonstrating advanced capabilities in multi-page questioning answering, explanation with evidence pages, and cross-page structure understanding. Additionally, compared to single-image MLLMs trained on similar data, our DocOwl2 achieves comparable single-page understanding performance with less than 20% of the visual tokens.

<p>Abstract: Due to the diverse geographical environments, intricate landscapes, and high-density settlements, the automatic identification of urban village boundaries using remote sensing images remains a highly challenging task. This paper proposes a novel and efficient neural network model called UV-Mamba for accurate boundary detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. UV-Mamba mitigates the memory loss problem in lengthy sequence modeling, which arises in state space models with increasing image size, by incorporating deformable convolutions. Its architecture utilizes an encoder-decoder framework and includes an encoder with four deformable state space augmentation blocks for efficient multi-level semantic extraction and a decoder to integrate the extracted semantic information. We conducted experiments on two large datasets showing that UV-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our model achieves 73.3% and 78.1% IoU on the Beijing and Xi'an datasets, respectively, representing improvements of 1.2% and 3.4% IoU over the previous best model while also being 6x faster in inference speed and 40x smaller in parameter count.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Purohit, Anurag Reddy Parvathgari, Sourangshu Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performance in many computer vision tasks. However, their large model sizes require heavy computational resources, making pruning redundant filters from existing pre-trained CNNs an essential task in developing efficient models for resource-constrained devices. Whole-network filter pruning algorithms prune varying fractions of filters from each layer, hence providing greater flexibility. Current whole-network pruning methods are either computationally expensive due to the need to calculate the loss for each pruned filter using a training dataset, or use various heuristic / learned criteria for determining the pruning fractions for each layer. This paper proposes a two-level hierarchical approach for whole-network filter pruning which is efficient and uses the classification loss as the final criterion. The lower-level algorithm (called filter-pruning) uses a sparse-approximation formulation based on linear approximation of filter weights. We explore two algorithms: orthogonal matching pursuit-based greedy selection and a greedy backward pruning approach. The backward pruning algorithm uses a novel closed-form error criterion for efficiently selecting the optimal filter at each stage, thus making the whole algorithm much faster. The higher-level algorithm (called layer-selection) greedily selects the best-pruned layer (pruning using the filter-selection algorithm) using a global pruning criterion. We propose algorithms for two different global-pruning criteria: (1) layer-wise relative error (HBGS), and (2) final classification error (HBGTS). Our suite of algorithms outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on ResNet18, ResNet32, ResNet56, VGG16, and ResNext101. Our method reduces the RAM requirement for ResNext101 from 7.6 GB to 1.5 GB and achieves a 94% reduction in FLOPS without losing accuracy on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains an ongoing challenge for AI models, especially for geometry problems that require both linguistic and visual signals. As the vision encoders of most MLLMs are trained on natural scenes, they often struggle to understand geometric diagrams, performing no better in geometry problem solving than LLMs that only process text. This limitation is amplified by the lack of effective methods for representing geometric relationships. To address these issues, we introduce the Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver (DFE-GPS), a new framework that integrates visual features, geometric formal language, and natural language representations. We propose a novel synthetic data approach and create a large-scale geometric dataset, SynthGeo228K, annotated with both formal and natural language captions, designed to enhance the vision encoder for a better understanding of geometric structures. Our framework improves MLLMs' ability to process geometric diagrams and extends their application to open-ended tasks on the formalgeo7k dataset.</p>

To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA - a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. We then benchmark and show that existing MLLMs excelling at single-event QA struggle to perform well in DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.1 percent and 3.7 percent for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA and NExT-GQA respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudi Dai, Zhiyong Wang, Xiping Lin, Chenglu Wen, Lan Xu, Siqi Shen, Yuexin Ma, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce HiSC4D, a novel Human-centered interaction and 4D Scene Capture method, aimed at accurately and efficiently creating a dynamic digital world, containing large-scale indoor-outdoor scenes, diverse human motions, rich human-human interactions, and human-environment interactions. By utilizing body-mounted IMUs and a head-mounted LiDAR, HiSC4D can capture egocentric human motions in unconstrained space without the need for external devices and pre-built maps. This affords great flexibility and accessibility for human-centered interaction and 4D scene capturing in various environments. Taking into account that IMUs can capture human spatially unrestricted poses but are prone to drifting for long-period using, and while LiDAR is stable for global localization but rough for local positions and orientations, HiSC4D employs a joint optimization method, harmonizing all sensors and utilizing environment cues, yielding promising results for long-term capture in large scenes. To promote research of egocentric human interaction in large scenes and facilitate downstream tasks, we also present a dataset, containing 8 sequences in 4 large scenes (200 to 5,000 $m^2$), providing 36k frames of accurate 4D human motions with SMPL annotations and dynamic scenes, 31k frames of cropped human point clouds, and scene mesh of the environment. A variety of scenarios, such as the basketball gym and commercial street, alongside challenging human motions, such as daily greeting, one-on-one basketball playing, and tour guiding, demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of HiSC4D. The dataset and code will be publicated on www.lidarhumanmotion.net/hisc4d available for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaishnavh Nagarajan, Anders Andreassen, Behnam Neyshabur</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical studies suggest that machine learning models often rely on features, such as the background, that may be spuriously correlated with the label only during training time, resulting in poor accuracy during test-time. In this work, we identify the fundamental factors that give rise to this behavior, by explaining why models fail this way {\em even} in easy-to-learn tasks where one would expect these models to succeed. In particular, through a theoretical study of gradient-descent-trained linear classifiers on some easy-to-learn tasks, we uncover two complementary failure modes. These modes arise from how spurious correlations induce two kinds of skews in the data: one geometric in nature, and another, statistical in nature. Finally, we construct natural modifications of image classification datasets to understand when these failure modes can arise in practice. We also design experiments to isolate the two failure modes when training modern neural networks on these datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Liu, Ming Yi, Kangyi Ding, Bangzhou Xin, Yixiao Xu, Li Yan, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject malicious behavior through data poisoning and later exploit triggers to manipulate deployed models. To improve the stealth and effectiveness of backdoors, prior studies have introduced various imperceptible attack methods targeting both defense mechanisms and manual inspection. However, all poisoning-based attacks still rely on privileged access to the training dataset. Consequently, model distillation using a trusted dataset has emerged as an effective defense against these attacks. To bridge this gap, we introduce INK, an inheritable natural backdoor attack that targets model distillation. The key insight behind INK is the use of naturally occurring statistical features in all datasets, allowing attackers to leverage them as backdoor triggers without direct access to the training data. Specifically, INK employs image variance as a backdoor trigger and enables both clean-image and clean-label attacks by manipulating the labels and image variance in an unauthenticated dataset. Once the backdoor is embedded, it transfers from the teacher model to the student model, even when defenders use a trusted dataset for distillation. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the robustness of INK against transformation-based, search-based, and distillation-based defenses. For instance, INK maintains an attack success rate of over 98\% post-distillation, compared to an average success rate of 1.4\% for existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Bogert, Matthew Kothe</p>
<p>Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy is a well-established technique for choosing a distribution that matches available information while minimizing bias. It finds broad use across scientific disciplines and in machine learning. However, the principle as defined by is susceptible to noise and error in observations. This forces real-world practitioners to use relaxed versions of the principle in an ad hoc way, negatively impacting interpretation. To address this situation, we present a new principle we call uncertain maximum entropy that generalizes the classic principle and provides interpretable solutions irrespective of the observational methods in use. We introduce a convex approximation and expectation-maximization based algorithm for finding solutions to our new principle. Finally, we contrast this new technique with two simpler generally applicable solutions theoretically and experimentally show our technique provides superior accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoyi Sun, Xuenan Xu, Mengyue Wu, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the AI community has made significant strides in developing powerful foundation models, driven by large-scale multimodal datasets. However, for audio representation learning, existing datasets suffer from limitations in the following aspects: insufficient volume, simplistic content, and arduous collection procedures. To establish an audio dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an innovative, automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as video frames, audio streams. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, audio-language dataset, named as Auto-ACD, comprising over 1.5M audio-text pairs. We exploit a series of pre-trained models or APIs, to determine audio-visual synchronisation, generate image captions, object detection, or audio tags for specific videos. Subsequently, we employ LLM to paraphrase a congruent caption for each audio, guided by the extracted multi-modality clues. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train widely used models on our dataset and show performance improvement on various downstream tasks, for example, audio-language retrieval, audio captioning, zero-shot classification. In addition, we establish a novel benchmark with environmental information and provide a benchmark for audio-text tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Shah, Kashish Mittal, Ajit Rajwade</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents an adaptive group testing framework for the range-based high dimensional near neighbor search problem. Our method efficiently marks each item in a database as neighbor or non-neighbor of a query point, based on a cosine distance threshold without exhaustive search. Like other methods for large scale retrieval, our approach exploits the assumption that most of the items in the database are unrelated to the query. However, it does not assume a large difference between the cosine similarity of the query vector with the least related neighbor and that with the least unrelated non-neighbor. Following a multi-stage adaptive group testing algorithm based on binary splitting, we divide the set of items to be searched into half at each step, and perform dot product tests on smaller and smaller subsets, many of which we are able to prune away. We show that, using softmax-based features, our method achieves a more than ten-fold speed-up over exhaustive search with no loss of accuracy, on a variety of large datasets. Based on empirically verified models for the distribution of cosine distances, we present a theoretical analysis of the expected number of distance computations per query and the probability that a pool will be pruned. Our method has the following features: (i) It implicitly exploits useful distributional properties of cosine distances unlike other methods; (ii) All required data structures are created purely offline; (iii) It does not impose any strong assumptions on the number of true near neighbors; (iv) It is adaptable to streaming settings where new vectors are dynamically added to the database; and (v) It does not require any parameter tuning. The high recall of our technique makes it particularly suited to plagiarism detection scenarios where it is important to report every database item that is sufficiently similar item to the query.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) continue to advance, evaluating the performance of LMMs emerges as an increasing need. Additionally, there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU, a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU. CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge in the Chinese context. We evaluate 11 open-source LLMs and one proprietary GPT-4V(ision). Even GPT-4V only achieves accuracies of 42%, indicating a large space for improvement. CMMMU will boost the community to build the next-generation LMMs towards expert artificial intelligence and promote the democratization of LMMs by providing diverse language contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatong Bai, Mo Zhou, Vishal M. Patel, Somayeh Sojoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness often comes at the cost of degraded accuracy, impeding real-life applications of robust classification models. Training-based solutions for better trade-offs are limited by incompatibilities with already-trained high-performance large models, necessitating the exploration of training-free ensemble approaches. Observing that robust models are more confident in correct predictions than in incorrect ones on clean and adversarial data alike, we speculate amplifying this "benign confidence property" can reconcile accuracy and robustness in an ensemble setting. To achieve so, we propose "MixedNUTS", a training-free method where the output logits of a robust classifier and a standard non-robust classifier are processed by nonlinear transformations with only three parameters, which are optimized through an efficient algorithm. MixedNUTS then converts the transformed logits into probabilities and mixes them as the overall output. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, experimental results with custom strong adaptive attacks demonstrate MixedNUTS's vastly improved accuracy and near-SOTA robustness -- it boosts CIFAR-100 clean accuracy by 7.86 points, sacrificing merely 0.87 points in robust accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Huang, Liheng Qiu, Shenmiao Yang, Longxi Li, Jiaofen Nan, Yanting Li, Chuang Han, Fubao Zhu, Chen Zhao, Weihua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Accurate segmentation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) lesions is challenging due to their complex patterns in medical imaging.
  Objective: This study aims to develop a precise segmentation method for DLBCL using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images.
  Methods: We propose a 3D dual-branch encoder segmentation method using shifted window transformers and a Multi-Scale Information Fusion (MSIF) module. To enhance feature integration, the MSIF module performs multi-scale feature fusion using cross-attention mechanisms with a shifted window framework. A gated neural network within the MSIF module dynamically balances the contributions from each modality. The model was optimized using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) loss function. Additionally, we computed the total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and performed statistical analyses.
  Results: The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 165 DLBCL patients using 5-fold cross-validation, achieving a DSC of 0.7512. Statistical analysis showed a significant improvement over comparative methods (p < 0.05). Additionally, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an R^2 of 0.89 were observed when comparing manual annotations to segmentation results for TMTV measurement.
  Conclusion: This study presents an effective automatic segmentation method for DLBCL that leverages the complementary strengths of PET and CT imaging. Our method has the potential to improve diagnostic interpretations and assist in treatment planning for DLBCL patients.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study delves into the enhancement of Under-Display Camera (UDC) image restoration models, focusing on their robustness against adversarial attacks. Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Bian, Shengjing Tian, Xiuping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud processing starkly contrasts with their susceptibility to security breaches, notably backdoor attacks. These attacks hijack DNNs during training, embedding triggers in the data that, once activated, cause the network to make predetermined errors while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. This vulnerability poses significant risks, especially given the insufficient research on robust defense mechanisms for 3D point cloud networks against such sophisticated threats. Existing attacks either struggle to resist basic point cloud pre-processing methods, or rely on delicate manual design. Exploring simple, effective, imperceptible, and difficult-to-defend triggers in 3D point clouds is still challenging.To address these challenges, we introduce MirrorAttack, a novel effective 3D backdoor attack method, which implants the trigger by simply reconstructing a clean point cloud with an auto-encoder. The data-driven nature of the MirrorAttack obviates the need for complex manual design. Minimizing the reconstruction loss automatically improves imperceptibility. Simultaneously, the reconstruction network endows the trigger with pronounced nonlinearity and sample specificity, rendering traditional preprocessing techniques ineffective in eliminating it. A trigger smoothing module based on spherical harmonic transformation is also attached to regulate the intensity of the attack.Both quantitive and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of our method. We achieve state-of-the-art ASR on different types of victim models with the intervention of defensive techniques. Moreover, the minimal perturbation introduced by our trigger, as assessed by various metrics, attests to the method's stealth, ensuring its imperceptibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of medical imaging, particularly for COVID-19 detection, deep learning models face substantial challenges such as the necessity for extensive computational resources, the paucity of well-annotated datasets, and a significant amount of unlabeled data. In this work, we introduce the first lightweight detector designed to overcome these obstacles, leveraging a frozen CLIP image encoder and a trainable multilayer perception (MLP). Enhanced with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for robustness and a loss landscape flattening strategy for improved generalization, our model is tailored for high efficacy in COVID-19 detection. Furthermore, we integrate a teacher-student framework to capitalize on the vast amounts of unlabeled data, enabling our model to achieve superior performance despite the inherent data limitations. Experimental results on the COV19-CT-DB dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing baseline by up to 10.6% in `macro' F1 score in supervised learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Yang, Richard Simon, Kelly Merrell, Cristian. A. Linte</p>
<p>Abstract: In image-guided liver surgery, 3D-3D non-rigid registration methods play a crucial role in estimating the mapping between the preoperative model and the intraoperative surface represented as point clouds, addressing the challenge of tissue deformation. Typically, these methods incorporate a biomechanical model, represented as a finite element model (FEM), used to regularize a surface matching term. This paper introduces a novel 3D-3D non-rigid registration method. In contrast to the preceding techniques, our method uniquely incorporates the FEM within the surface matching term itself, ensuring that the estimated deformation maintains geometric consistency throughout the registration process. Additionally, we eliminate the need to determine zero-boundary conditions and applied force locations in the FEM. We achieve this by integrating soft springs into the stiffness matrix and allowing forces to be distributed across the entire liver surface. To further improve robustness, we introduce a regularization technique focused on the gradient of the force magnitudes. This regularization imposes spatial smoothness and helps prevent the overfitting of irregular noise in intraoperative data. Optimization is achieved through an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, further enhanced by our proposed method for determining the optimal step size. Our method is evaluated and compared to both a learning-based method and a traditional method that features FEM regularization using data collected on our custom-developed phantom, as well as two publicly available datasets. Our method consistently outperforms or is comparable to the baseline techniques. Both the code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John J. Han, Ayberk Acar, Nicholas Kavoussi, Jie Ying Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Style transfer is a promising approach to close the sim-to-real gap in medical endoscopy. Rendering synthetic endoscopic videos by traversing pre-operative scans (such as MRI or CT) can generate structurally accurate simulations as well as ground truth camera poses and depth maps. Although image-to-image (I2I) translation models such as CycleGAN can imitate realistic endoscopic images from these simulations, they are unsuitable for video-to-video synthesis due to the lack of temporal consistency, resulting in artifacts between frames. We propose MeshBrush, a neural mesh stylization method to synthesize temporally consistent videos with differentiable rendering. MeshBrush uses the underlying geometry of patient imaging data while leveraging existing I2I methods. With learned per-vertex textures, the stylized mesh guarantees consistency while producing high-fidelity outputs. We demonstrate that mesh stylization is a promising approach for creating realistic simulations for downstream tasks such as training networks and preoperative planning. Although our method is tested and designed for ureteroscopy, its components are transferable to general endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures. The code will be made public on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Breen, Katie Allen, Kieran Zucker, Lucy Godson, Nicolas M. Orsi, Nishant Ravikumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show great promise across many tasks, but analyses have typically been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task. We report the most rigorous single-task validation of histopathology foundation models to date, specifically in ovarian cancer morphological subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using three ImageNet-pretrained feature extractors and fourteen histopathology foundation models. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for hold-out testing and external validation on the Transcanadian Study and OCEAN Challenge datasets. The best-performing model used the H-optimus-0 foundation model, with five-class balanced accuracies of 89%, 97%, and 74% in the test sets. Normalisations and augmentations aided the performance of the ImageNet-pretrained ResNets, but these were still outperformed by 13 of the 14 foundation models. Hyperparameter tuning the downstream classifiers improved performance by a median 1.9% balanced accuracy, with many improvements being statistically significant. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to ovarian cancer subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion to histopathologists diagnosing challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Xu, Qiao Ke, Jiangjun Peng, Xiangyong Cao, Zixiang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel paradigm for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising, which is termed \textit{pan-denoising}. In a given scene, panchromatic (PAN) images capture similar structures and textures to HSIs but with less noise. This enables the utilization of PAN images to guide the HSI denoising process. Consequently, pan-denoising, which incorporates an additional prior, has the potential to uncover underlying structures and details beyond the internal information modeling of traditional HSI denoising methods. However, the proper modeling of this additional prior poses a significant challenge. To alleviate this issue, the paper proposes a novel regularization term, Panchromatic Weighted Representation Coefficient Total Variation (PWRCTV). It employs the gradient maps of PAN images to automatically assign different weights of TV regularization for each pixel, resulting in larger weights for smooth areas and smaller weights for edges. This regularization forms the basis of a pan-denoising model, which is solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PWRCTV outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of metrics and visual quality. Furthermore, an HSI classification experiment confirms that PWRCTV, as a preprocessing method, can enhance the performance of downstream classification tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Teoh, Sumit Patidar, Xiao Ma, Stephen James</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalising vision-based manipulation policies to novel environments remains a challenging area with limited exploration. Current practices involve collecting data in one location, training imitation learning or reinforcement learning policies with this data, and deploying the policy in the same location. However, this approach lacks scalability as it necessitates data collection in multiple locations for each task. This paper proposes a novel approach where data is collected in a location predominantly featuring green screens. We introduce Green-screen Augmentation (GreenAug), employing a chroma key algorithm to overlay background textures onto a green screen. Through extensive real-world empirical studies with over 850 training demonstrations and 8.2k evaluation episodes, we demonstrate that GreenAug surpasses no augmentation, standard computer vision augmentation, and prior generative augmentation methods in performance. While no algorithmic novelties are claimed, our paper advocates for a fundamental shift in data collection practices. We propose that real-world demonstrations in future research should utilise green screens, followed by the application of GreenAug. We believe GreenAug unlocks policy generalisation to visually distinct novel locations, addressing the current scene generalisation limitations in robot learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mobina Mansoori, Sajjad Shahabodini, Jamshid Abouei, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Arash Mohammadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Polyp segmentation plays a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, obtaining accurate segmentations often requires labor-intensive annotations and specialized models. Recently, Meta AI Research released a general Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), which has demonstrated promising performance in several segmentation tasks. In this manuscript, we evaluate the performance of SAM 2 in segmenting polyps under various prompted settings. We hope this report will provide insights to advance the field of polyp segmentation and promote more interesting work in the future.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-liang Lu, Yu-meng Su, Zhuo Bi, Cheng Qiu, Wen-jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and traditional numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations (DEs) through literature investigation and experimental validation. We focused on the soft-constrained PINN approach and formalized its mathematical framework and computational flow for solving Ordinary DEs and Partial DEs (ODEs/PDEs). The working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. We demonstrate that the DeepXDE-based implementation of PINN is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across CPU/GPU platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a few unsupervised collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. We also find that, with the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain of the training set, and especially is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN can easily impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance to ODEs that obey this physical law. Furthermore, PINN can also be used for stiff ODEs, PDEs, and other types of DEs, and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11289">HMT-UNet: A hybird Mamba-Transformer Vision UNet for Medical Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingya Zhang, Zhihao Chen, Yiyuan Ge, Xianping Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of medical image segmentation, models based on both CNN and Transformer have been thoroughly investigated. However, CNNs have limited modeling capabilities for long-range dependencies, making it challenging to exploit the semantic information within images fully. On the other hand, the quadratic computational complexity poses a challenge for Transformers. State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have been recognized as a promising method. They not only demonstrate superior performance in modeling long-range interactions, but also preserve a linear computational complexity. The hybrid mechanism of SSM (State Space Model) and Transformer, after meticulous design, can enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that integrating the self-attention mechanism into the hybrid part behind the layers of Mamba's architecture can greatly improve the modeling capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, leveraging the hybrid mechanism of SSM, we propose a U-shape architecture model for medical image segmentation, named Hybird Transformer vision Mamba UNet (HTM-UNet). We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS-Larib PolypDB public datasets and ZD-LCI-GIM private dataset. The results indicate that HTM-UNet exhibits competitive performance in medical image segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/simzhangbest/HMT-Unet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedeh Fahimeh Hosseini, Faezeh Shalbafzadeh, Behzad Amanpour-Gharaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiological images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images, typically consist of a body part and a dark background. For many analyses, it is necessary to separate the body part from the background. In this article, we present a Python code designed to separate body and background regions in 2D and 3D radiological images. We tested the algorithm on various MRI and CT images of different body parts, including the brain, neck, and abdominal regions. Additionally, we introduced a method for intensity normalization and outlier restriction, adjusted for data conversion into 8-bit unsigned integer (UINT8) format, and examined its effects on body-background separation. Our Python code is available for use with proper citation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Yuan, Adrien Bousseau, Hao Pan, Chengquan Zhang, Niloy J. Mitra, Changjian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable rendering is a key ingredient for inverse rendering and machine learning, as it allows to optimize scene parameters (shape, materials, lighting) to best fit target images. Differentiable rendering requires that each scene parameter relates to pixel values through differentiable operations. While 3D mesh rendering algorithms have been implemented in a differentiable way, these algorithms do not directly extend to Constructive-Solid-Geometry (CSG), a popular parametric representation of shapes, because the underlying boolean operations are typically performed with complex black-box mesh-processing libraries. We present an algorithm, DiffCSG, to render CSG models in a differentiable manner. Our algorithm builds upon CSG rasterization, which displays the result of boolean operations between primitives without explicitly computing the resulting mesh and, as such, bypasses black-box mesh processing. We describe how to implement CSG rasterization within a differentiable rendering pipeline, taking special care to apply antialiasing along primitive intersections to obtain gradients in such critical areas. Our algorithm is simple and fast, can be easily incorporated into modern machine learning setups, and enables a range of applications for computer-aided design, including direct and image-based editing of CSG primitives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpei Honma, Akisato Kimura, Go Irie</p>
<p>Abstract: Measuring 3D geometric structures of indoor scenes requires dedicated depth sensors, which are not always available. Echo-based depth estimation has recently been studied as a promising alternative solution. All previous studies have assumed the use of echoes in the audible range. However, one major problem is that audible echoes cannot be used in quiet spaces or other situations where producing audible sounds is prohibited. In this paper, we consider echo-based depth estimation using inaudible ultrasonic echoes. While ultrasonic waves provide high measurement accuracy in theory, the actual depth estimation accuracy when ultrasonic echoes are used has remained unclear, due to its disadvantage of being sensitive to noise and susceptible to attenuation. We first investigate the depth estimation accuracy when the frequency of the sound source is restricted to the high-frequency band, and found that the accuracy decreased when the frequency was limited to ultrasonic ranges. Based on this observation, we propose a novel deep learning method to improve the accuracy of ultrasonic echo-based depth estimation by using audible echoes as auxiliary data only during training. Experimental results with a public dataset demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy.</p>
