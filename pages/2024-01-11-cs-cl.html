<p>Workshop proceedings of two co-located workshops "Working with Troubles and
Failures in Conversation with Humans and Robots" (WTF 2023) and "Is CUI Design
Ready Yet?", both of which were part of the ACM conference on conversational
user interfaces 2023.
</p>
<p>WTF 23 aimed at bringing together researchers from human-robot interaction,
dialogue systems, human-computer interaction, and conversation analysis.
Despite all progress, robotic speech interfaces continue to be brittle in a
number of ways and the experience of failure of such interfaces is commonplace
amongst roboticists. However, the technical literature is positively skewed
toward their good performance. The workshop aims to provide a platform for
discussing communicative troubles and failures in human-robot interactions and
related failures in non-robotic speech interfaces. Aims include a scrupulous
investigation into communicative failures, to begin working on a taxonomy of
such failures, and enable a preliminary discussion on possible mitigating
strategies. Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/wtf2023/overview
</p>
<p>Is CUI Design Ready Yet? As CUIs become more prevalent in both academic
research and the commercial market, it becomes more essential to design usable
and adoptable CUIs. While research has been growing on the methods for
designing CUIs for commercial use, there has been little discussion on the
overall community practice of developing design resources to aid in practical
CUI design. The aim of this workshop, therefore, is to bring the CUI community
together to discuss the current practices for developing tools and resources
for practical CUI design, the adoption (or non-adoption) of these tools and
resources, and how these resources are utilized in the training and education
of new CUI designers entering the field. Workshop website:

<p>The growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots
such as ChatGPT is having transformative effects on social media. As the
prevalence of AI-generated content grows, concerns have been raised regarding
privacy and misinformation online. Among social media platforms, Discord
enables AI integrations -- making their primarily "Generation Z" userbase
particularly exposed to AI-generated content. We surveyed Generation Z aged
individuals (n = 335) to evaluate their proficiency in discriminating between
AI-generated and human-authored text on Discord. The investigation employed
one-shot prompting of ChatGPT, disguised as a text message received on the
Discord.com platform. We explore the influence of demographic factors on
ability, as well as participants' familiarity with Discord and artificial
intelligence technologies. We find that Generation Z individuals are unable to
discern between AI and human-authored text (p = 0.011), and that those with
lower self-reported familiarity with Discord demonstrated an improved ability
in identifying human-authored compared to those with self-reported experience
with AI (p &lt;&lt; 0.0001). Our results suggest that there is a nuanced relationship
between AI technology and popular modes of communication for Generation Z,
contributing valuable insights into human-computer interactions, digital
communication, and artificial intelligence literacy.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Xia_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">Wenhan Xia</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Qin_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Chengwei Qin</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hazan_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Elad Hazan</a></p>
<p>Fine-tuning is the primary methodology for tailoring pre-trained large
language models to specific tasks. As the model's scale and the diversity of
tasks expand, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are of paramount
importance. One of the most widely used family of methods is low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and its variants. LoRA encodes weight update as the product
of two low-rank matrices. Despite its advantages, LoRA falls short of
full-parameter fine-tuning in terms of generalization error for certain tasks.
</p>
<p>We introduce Chain of LoRA (COLA), an iterative optimization framework
inspired by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, to bridge the gap between LoRA and full
parameter fine-tuning, without incurring additional computational costs or
memory overheads. COLA employs a residual learning procedure where it merges
learned LoRA modules into the pre-trained language model parameters and
re-initilize optimization for new born LoRA modules. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees as well as empirical results to validate the
effectiveness of our algorithm. Across various models (OPT and llama-2) and
seven benchmarking tasks, we demonstrate that COLA can consistently outperform
LoRA without additional computational or memory costs.

<p>End-to-end multi-talker speech recognition has garnered great interest as an
effective approach to directly transcribe overlapped speech from multiple
speakers. Current methods typically adopt either 1) single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) models with a branched encoder, or 2) single-input
single-output (SISO) models based on attention-based encoder-decoder
architecture with serialized output training (SOT). In this work, we propose a
Cross-Speaker Encoding (CSE) network to address the limitations of SIMO models
by aggregating cross-speaker representations. Furthermore, the CSE model is
integrated with SOT to leverage both the advantages of SIMO and SISO while
mitigating their drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents
an early effort to integrate SIMO and SISO for multi-talker speech recognition.
Experiments on the two-speaker LibrispeechMix dataset show that the CES model
reduces word error rate (WER) by 8% over the SIMO baseline. The CSE-SOT model
reduces WER by 10% overall and by 16% on high-overlap speech compared to the
SOT model.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models
based on deep learning, which have great performance in various tasks,
especially in natural language processing (NLP). Large language models
typically consist of artificial neural networks with numerous parameters,
trained on large amounts of unlabeled input using self-supervised or
semi-supervised learning. However, their potential for solving bioinformatics
problems may even exceed their proficiency in modeling human language. In this
review, we will present a summary of the prominent large language models used
in natural language processing, such as BERT and GPT, and focus on exploring
the applications of large language models at different omics levels in
bioinformatics, mainly including applications of large language models in
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and single cell analysis.
Finally, this review summarizes the potential and prospects of large language
models in solving bioinformatic problems.

<p>Automatically understanding funny moments (i.e., the moments that make people
laugh) when watching comedy is challenging, as they relate to various features,
such as body language, dialogues and culture. In this paper, we propose
FunnyNet-W, a model that relies on cross- and self-attention for visual, audio
and text data to predict funny moments in videos. Unlike most methods that rely
on ground truth data in the form of subtitles, in this work we exploit
modalities that come naturally with videos: (a) video frames as they contain
visual information indispensable for scene understanding, (b) audio as it
contains higher-level cues associated with funny moments, such as intonation,
pitch and pauses and (c) text automatically extracted with a speech-to-text
model as it can provide rich information when processed by a Large Language
Model. To acquire labels for training, we propose an unsupervised approach that
spots and labels funny audio moments. We provide experiments on five datasets:
the sitcoms TBBT, MHD, MUStARD, Friends, and the TED talk UR-Funny. Extensive
experiments and analysis show that FunnyNet-W successfully exploits visual,
auditory and textual cues to identify funny moments, while our findings reveal
FunnyNet-W's ability to predict funny moments in the wild. FunnyNet-W sets the
new state of the art for funny moment detection with multimodal cues on all
datasets with and without using ground truth information.

<p>We present a benchmark for assessing the capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to discern intercardinal directions between geographic locations and
apply it to three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2. This benchmark
specifically evaluates whether LLMs exhibit a hierarchical spatial bias similar
to humans, where judgments about individual locations' spatial relationships
are influenced by the perceived relationships of the larger groups that contain
them. To investigate this, we formulated 14 questions focusing on well-known
American cities. Seven questions were designed to challenge the LLMs with
scenarios potentially influenced by the orientation of larger geographical
units, such as states or countries, while the remaining seven targeted
locations less susceptible to such hierarchical categorization. Among the
tested models, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance with 55.3% accuracy,
followed by GPT-3.5 at 47.3%, and Llama-2 at 44.7%. The models showed
significantly reduced accuracy on tasks with suspected hierarchical bias. For
example, GPT-4's accuracy dropped to 32.9% on these tasks, compared to 85.7% on
others. Despite these inaccuracies, the models identified the nearest cardinal
direction in most cases, suggesting associative learning, embodying human-like
misconceptions. We discuss the potential of text-based data representing
geographic relationships directly to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities
of LLMs.

<p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can suffer from poor recall for
various reasons, such as noisy audio, lack of sufficient training data, etc.
</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that recall can be improved by retrieving rewrite
candidates from a large database of likely, contextually-relevant alternatives
to the hypothesis text using nearest-neighbors search over embeddings of the
ASR hypothesis text to correct and candidate corrections.
</p>
<p>However, ASR-hypothesis-based retrieval can yield poor precision if the
textual hypotheses are too phonetically dissimilar to the transcript truth. In
this paper, we eliminate the hypothesis-audio mismatch problem by querying the
correction database directly using embeddings derived from the utterance audio;
the embeddings of the utterance audio and candidate corrections are produced by
multimodal speech-text embedding networks trained to place the embedding of the
audio of an utterance and the embedding of its corresponding textual transcript
close together.
</p>
<p>After locating an appropriate correction candidate using nearest-neighbor
search, we score the candidate with its speech-text embedding distance before
adding the candidate to the original n-best list.
</p>
<p>We show a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 6% on utterances whose
transcripts appear in the candidate set, without increasing WER on general
utterances.

<p>We study the ability of LLMs to generate feedback for scientific papers and
develop MARG, a feedback generation approach using multiple LLM instances that
engage in internal discussion. By distributing paper text across agents, MARG
can consume the full text of papers beyond the input length limitations of the
base LLM, and by specializing agents and incorporating sub-tasks tailored to
different comment types (experiments, clarity, impact) it improves the
helpfulness and specificity of feedback. In a user study, baseline methods
using GPT-4 were rated as producing generic or very generic comments more than
half the time, and only 1.7 comments per paper were rated as good overall in
the best baseline. Our system substantially improves the ability of GPT-4 to
generate specific and helpful feedback, reducing the rate of generic comments

<p>Indoor imaging is a critical task for robotics and internet-of-things. WiFi
as an omnipresent signal is a promising candidate for carrying out passive
imaging and synchronizing the up-to-date information to all connected devices.
This is the first research work to consider WiFi indoor imaging as a
multi-modal image generation task that converts the measured WiFi power into a
high-resolution indoor image. Our proposed WiFi-GEN network achieves a shape
reconstruction accuracy that is 275% of that achieved by physical model-based
inversion methods. Additionally, the Frechet Inception Distance score has been
significantly reduced by 82%. To examine the effectiveness of models for this
task, the first large-scale dataset is released containing 80,000 pairs of WiFi
signal and imaging target. Our model absorbs challenges for the model-based
methods including the non-linearity, ill-posedness and non-certainty into
massive parameters of our generative AI network. The network is also designed
to best fit measured WiFi signals and the desired imaging output. For
reproducibility, we will release the data and code upon acceptance.

<p>In this paper, we explore a new way for user targeting, where non-expert
marketers could select their target users solely given demands in natural
language form. The key to this issue is how to transform natural languages into
practical structured logical languages, i.e., the structured understanding of
marketer demands. Considering the impressive natural language processing
ability of large language models (LLMs), we try to leverage LLMs to solve this
issue. Past research indicates that the reasoning ability of LLMs can be
effectively enhanced through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. But existing
methods still have some limitations: (1) Previous methods either use simple
"Let's think step by step" spells or provide fixed examples in demonstrations
without considering compatibility between prompts and questions, making LLMs
ineffective in some complex reasoning tasks such as structured language
transformation. (2) Previous methods are often implemented in closed-source
models or excessively large models, which is not suitable in industrial
practical scenarios. Based on these, we propose ARALLM (i.e., Analogical
Reasoning Augmented Large Language Models) consisting of two modules:
Analogical Reasoning based Prompting and Reasoning-Augmented Multi-Task Model
Distillation.

risks by enforcing algorithmic stability. DP-SGD enables training models with
private data in a privacy-preserving manner, but raises new obstacles in the
form of performance loss and significant engineering challenges. We introduce
DP-ZO, a new method for fine-tuning large language models that preserves the
privacy of training data by privatizing zeroth-order optimization. A key
insight into the design of our method is that the direction of the gradient in
SPSA, the zeroth-order algorithm we use, is always random and the only
information that depends on private data is the step size, i.e., a scalar.
Therefore, we only need to privatize the scalar step size, which is
memory-efficient. DP-ZO, which can be instantiated with either Laplace or
Gaussian noise, provides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different
tasks, and model sizes, under conservative privacy budgets. One noteworthy
result is that DP-ZO exhibits just $1.86\%$ performance degradation due to
privacy at $(1,10^{-5})$-DP when fine-tuning OPT-66B on 1000 training samples
from SQuAD.

<p>Paraphrases are texts that convey the same meaning while using different
words or sentence structures. It can be used as an automatic data augmentation
tool for many Natural Language Processing tasks, especially when dealing with
low-resource languages, where data shortage is a significant problem. To
generate a paraphrase in multilingual settings, previous studies have leveraged
the knowledge from the machine translation field, i.e., forming a paraphrase
through zero-shot machine translation in the same language. Despite good
performance on human evaluation, those methods still require parallel
translation datasets, thus making them inapplicable to languages that do not
have parallel corpora. To mitigate that problem, we proposed the first
unsupervised multilingual paraphrasing model, LAMPAT ($\textbf{L}$ow-rank
$\textbf{A}$daptation for $\textbf{M}$ultilingual $\textbf{P}$araphrasing using
$\textbf{A}$dversarial $\textbf{T}$raining), by which monolingual dataset is
sufficient enough to generate a human-like and diverse sentence. Throughout the
experiments, we found out that our method not only works well for English but
can generalize on unseen languages as well. Data and code are available at

<p>Knowledge-grounded dialogue (KGD) learns to generate an informative response
based on a given dialogue context and external knowledge (\emph{e.g.},
knowledge graphs; KGs). Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs)
and pre-training techniques has brought great success to knowledge-grounded
dialogue. However, when building KGD systems in real applications, there are
various real-world noises that are inevitable to face. For example, the
dialogue context might involve perturbations such as misspellings and
abbreviations. In addition, KGs typically suffer from incompletion and also
might contain erroneous and outdated facts. Such real-world noises pose a
challenge to the robustness of KGD systems and hinder their applications in the
real world. In this paper, we propose an entity-based contrastive learning
framework for improving the robustness of KGD. Specifically, we make use of the
entity information in a KGD sample to create both its positive and negative
samples which involve semantic-irrelevant and semantic-relevant perturbations,
respectively. The contrastive learning framework ensures the KGD model is aware
of these two types of perturbations, thus generating informative responses with
the potentially noisy inputs in real applications. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance in terms of automatic evaluation scores, verifying its
effectiveness and potentiality. Furthermore, we show that our method can
generate better responses than comparison models in both the noisy and the
few-shot settings.

<p>This study introduces a novel methodology for modelling patient emotions from
online patient experience narratives. We employed metadata network topic
modelling to analyse patient-reported experiences from Care Opinion, revealing
key emotional themes linked to patient-caregiver interactions and clinical
outcomes. We develop a probabilistic, context-specific emotion recommender
system capable of predicting both multilabel emotions and binary sentiments
using a naive Bayes classifier using contextually meaningful topics as
predictors. The superior performance of our predicted emotions under this model
compared to baseline models was assessed using the information retrieval
metrics nDCG and Q-measure, and our predicted sentiments achieved an F1 score
of 0.921, significantly outperforming standard sentiment lexicons. This method
offers a transparent, cost-effective way to understand patient feedback,
enhancing traditional collection methods and informing individualised patient
care. Our findings are accessible via an R package and interactive dashboard,

<p>Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising
direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based
question answering and fact verification. Compared with generic reasoning,
table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both
free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data. Chain-of-Thought and its
similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual
context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular
data in the reasoning chain. We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, where
tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for
intermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to
iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular
reasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based
on the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table
forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem. The
chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more
accurate and reliable predictions. Chain-of-Table achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM
choices.

<p>Due to their ease of use and high accuracy, Word2Vec (W2V) word embeddings
enjoy great success in the semantic representation of words, sentences, and
whole documents as well as for semantic similarity estimation. However, they
have the shortcoming that they are directly extracted from a surface
representation, which does not adequately represent human thought processes and
also performs poorly for highly ambiguous words. Therefore, we propose Semantic
Concept Embeddings (CE) based on the MultiNet Semantic Network (SN) formalism,
which addresses both shortcomings. The evaluation on a marketing target group
distribution task showed that the accuracy of predicted target groups can be
increased by combining traditional word embeddings with semantic CEs.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
have shown excellent general capabilities, even exhibiting adaptability in many
professional domains such as law, economics, transportation, and medicine.
Currently, many domain-specific benchmarks have been proposed to verify the
performance of (M)LLMs in specific fields. Among various domains,
transportation plays a crucial role in modern society as it impacts the
economy, the environment, and the quality of life for billions of people.
However, it is unclear how much traffic knowledge (M)LLMs possess and whether
they can reliably perform transportation-related tasks. To address this gap, we
propose TransportationGames, a carefully designed and thorough evaluation
benchmark for assessing (M)LLMs in the transportation domain. By
comprehensively considering the applications in real-world scenarios and
referring to the first three levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, we test the
performance of various (M)LLMs in memorizing, understanding, and applying
transportation knowledge by the selected tasks. The experimental results show
that although some models perform well in some tasks, there is still much room
for improvement overall. We hope the release of TransportationGames can serve
as a foundation for future research, thereby accelerating the implementation
and application of (M)LLMs in the transportation domain.

<p>The success of drug discovery and development relies on the precise
prediction of molecular activities and properties. While in silico molecular
property prediction has shown remarkable potential, its use has been limited so
far to assays for which large amounts of data are available. In this study, we
use a fine-tuned large language model to integrate biological assays based on
their textual information, coupled with Barlow Twins, a Siamese neural network
using a novel self-supervised learning approach. This architecture uses both
assay information and molecular fingerprints to extract the true molecular
information. TwinBooster enables the prediction of properties of unseen
bioassays and molecules by providing state-of-the-art zero-shot learning tasks.
Remarkably, our artificial intelligence pipeline shows excellent performance on
the FS-Mol benchmark. This breakthrough demonstrates the application of deep
learning to critical property prediction tasks where data is typically scarce.
By accelerating the early identification of active molecules in drug discovery

<p>The recent success in language generation capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), such as GPT, Bard, Llama etc., can potentially lead to concerns
about their possible misuse in inducing mass agitation and communal hatred via
generating fake news and spreading misinformation. Traditional means of
developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset does not scale well because of
the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. In this paper, we
propose an LLM-based approach of creating silver-standard ground-truth datasets
for identifying misinformation. Specifically speaking, given a trusted news
article, our proposed approach involves prompting LLMs to automatically
generate a summarised version of the original article. The prompts in our
proposed approach act as a controlling mechanism to generate specific types of
factual incorrectness in the generated summaries, e.g., incorrect quantities,
false attributions etc. To investigate the usefulness of this dataset, we
conduct a set of experiments where we train a range of supervised models for
the task of misinformation detection.

<p>Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still

domain-specific special words for which little or no data is available. To
address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose an self-supervised
continual learning approach. Given the audio of a lecture talk with
corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the
slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from previous work. Then, we
perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new
words into an adaptation dataset. Continual learning is then performed on this
set by adapting low-rank matrix weights added to each weight matrix of the
model. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this
approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur
more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance

<p>In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which
generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising
strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between
code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated
code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our
preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an
LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could
potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit
functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from
the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the
foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that
additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style
normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts
retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%),
and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search
scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research
in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first
metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our
empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing

<p>Critique, as a natural language description for assessing the quality of
model-generated content, has been proven to play an essential role in the
training, evaluation, and refinement of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
there is a lack of principled understanding in evaluating the quality of the
critique itself. In this paper, we pioneer the critique of critique, termed
MetaCritique, which is a framework to evaluate the critique from two aspects,
i.e., factuality as precision score and comprehensiveness as recall score. We
calculate the harmonic mean of precision and recall as the overall rating
called F1 score. To obtain a reliable evaluation outcome, we propose Atomic
Information Units (AIUs), which describe the critique in a more fine-grained
manner. MetaCritique takes each AIU into account and aggregates each AIU's
judgment for the overall score. Moreover, given the evaluation process involves
intricate reasoning, our MetaCritique provides a natural language rationale to
support each judgment. We construct a meta-evaluation dataset containing 300
critiques (2653 AIUs) across four tasks (question answering, reasoning,
entailment, and summarization), and we conduct a comparative study to
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness. Experiments also show superior
critique judged by MetaCritique leads to better refinement, indicating
generative artificial intelligence indeed has the potential to be significantly
advanced with our MetaCritique. We will release relevant code and
meta-evaluation datasets at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/MetaCritique.

<p>Over the past few years, one of the most notable advancements in AI research
has been in foundation models (FMs), headlined by the rise of language models
(LMs). As the models' size increases, LMs demonstrate enhancements in
measurable aspects and the development of new qualitative features. However,
despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, the
capabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be better
understood. To address these issues, we introduce an open Multimodal Evaluation
of Russian-language Architectures (MERA), a new instruction benchmark for
evaluating foundation models oriented towards the Russian language. The
benchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models in 11 skill
domains and is designed as a black-box test to ensure the exclusion of data
leakage. The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in zero-
and few-shot fixed instruction settings that can be extended to other
modalities. We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for
the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system. We evaluate
open LMs as baselines and find that they are still far behind the human level.
We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipate
groundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, and
address potential societal drawbacks.

<p>Companies, organizations, and governments increasingly exploit Language
Models' (LM) remarkable capability to display agent-like behavior. As LMs are
adopted to perform tasks with growing autonomy, there exists an urgent need for
reliable and scalable evaluation benchmarks. Current, predominantly static LM
benchmarks are ill-suited to evaluate such dynamic applications. Thus, we
propose jointly evaluating LM performance and alignment through the lenses of
negotiation games. We argue that this common task better reflects real-world
deployment conditions while offering insights into LMs' decision-making
processes. Crucially, negotiation games allow us to study multi-turn, and
cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental data
leakage in evaluation. We report results for six publicly accessible LMs from
several major providers on a variety of negotiation games, evaluating both
self-play and cross-play performance. Noteworthy findings include: (i)
open-source models are currently unable to complete these tasks; (ii)
cooperative bargaining games prove challenging; and (iii) the most powerful
models do not always "win".

<p>Mental health challenges pose considerable global burdens on individuals and
communities. Recent data indicates that more than 20% of adults may encounter
at least one mental disorder in their lifetime. On the one hand, the
advancements in large language models have facilitated diverse applications,
yet a significant research gap persists in understanding and enhancing the
potential of large language models within the domain of mental health. On the
other hand, across various applications, an outstanding question involves the
capacity of large language models to comprehend expressions of human mental
health conditions in natural language. This study presents an initial
evaluation of large language models in addressing this gap. Due to this, we
compare the performance of Llama-2 and ChatGPT with classical Machine as well
as Deep learning models. Our results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset show that
transformer-based models, like BERT or XLNet, outperform the large language
models.

<p>In the contemporary digital era, the Internet functions as an unparalleled
catalyst, dismantling geographical and linguistic barriers particularly evident
in texting. This evolution facilitates global communication, transcending
physical distances and fostering dynamic cultural exchange. A notable trend is
the widespread use of transliteration, where the English alphabet is employed
to convey messages in native languages, posing a unique challenge for language
technology in accurately detecting the source language. This paper addresses
this challenge through a dataset of phone text messages in Hindi and Russian
transliterated into English utilizing BERT for language classification and
Google Translate API for transliteration conversion. The research pioneers
innovative approaches to identify and convert transliterated text, navigating
challenges in the diverse linguistic landscape of digital communication.
Emphasizing the pivotal role of comprehensive datasets for training Large
Language Models LLMs like BERT, our model showcases exceptional proficiency in
accurately identifying and classifying languages from transliterated text. With
a validation accuracy of 99% our models robust performance underscores its
reliability. The comprehensive exploration of transliteration dynamics

<p>Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly permeating
various domains of human production and life, highlighting the importance of
aligning them with human values. The current alignment of AI systems primarily
focuses on passively aligning LLMs through human intervention. However, agents
possess characteristics like receiving environmental feedback and
self-evolution, rendering the LLM alignment methods inadequate. In response, we
propose an evolutionary framework for agent evolution and alignment, named
EvolutionaryAgent, which transforms agent alignment into a process of evolution
and selection under the principle of survival of the fittest. In an environment
where social norms continuously evolve, agents better adapted to the current
social norms will have a higher probability of survival and proliferation,
while those inadequately aligned dwindle over time. Experimental results
assessing the agents from multiple perspectives in aligning with social norms
demonstrate that EvolutionaryAgent possesses the capability to align
progressively better with the evolving social norms while maintaining its
proficiency in general tasks. Effectiveness tests conducted on various open and
closed-source LLMs as the foundation for agents also prove the applicability of
our approach.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional coding capability.
However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the
debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous
evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of
data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To
overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging
benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories
and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we
collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source
data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial
and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while
closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared
to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate
scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug
category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging
performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM
debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for
closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in
debugging.

<p>Effective prioritization of issue reports is crucial in software engineering
to optimize resource allocation and address critical problems promptly.
However, the manual classification of issue reports for prioritization is
laborious and lacks scalability. Alternatively, many open source software (OSS)
projects employ automated processes for this task, albeit relying on
substantial datasets for adequate training. This research seeks to devise an
automated approach that ensures reliability in issue prioritization, even when
trained on smaller datasets. Our proposed methodology harnesses the power of
Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), recognizing their potential to
efficiently handle this task. By leveraging the capabilities of such models, we
aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing issue reports accurately,
mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while maintaining
reliability. In our research, we have developed a reliable GPT-based approach
to accurately label and prioritize issue reports with a reduced training
dataset. By reducing reliance on massive data requirements and focusing on
few-shot fine-tuning, our methodology offers a more accessible and efficient
solution for issue prioritization in software engineering. Our model predicted
issue types in individual projects up to 93.2% in precision, 95% in recall, and
89.3% in F1-score.

<p>Emotions are integral to human social interactions, with diverse responses
elicited by various situational contexts. Particularly, the prevalence of
negative emotional states has been correlated with negative outcomes for mental
health, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of their occurrence and impact
on individuals. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset named DepressionEmo
designed to detect 8 emotions associated with depression by 6037 examples of
long Reddit user posts. This dataset was created through a majority vote over
inputs by zero-shot classifications from pre-trained models and validating the
quality by annotators and ChatGPT, exhibiting an acceptable level of interrater
reliability between annotators. The correlation between emotions, their
distribution over time, and linguistic analysis are conducted on DepressionEmo.
Besides, we provide several text classification methods classified into two
groups: machine learning methods such as SVM, XGBoost, and Light GBM; and deep
learning methods such as BERT, GAN-BERT, and BART. The pretrained BART model,
bart-base allows us to obtain the highest F1- Macro of 0.76, showing its
outperformance compared to other methods evaluated in our analysis. Across all
emotions, the highest F1-Macro value is achieved by suicide intent, indicating
a certain value of our dataset in identifying emotions in individuals with
depression symptoms through text analysis. The curated dataset is publicly

<p>Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently
emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its
ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear
attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without
sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various
sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue
with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot
demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we
present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that
enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To
achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the
intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation.
Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for
the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks.
A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to
take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton
to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on
different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains
consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and
is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is

<p>Factual questions typically can be answered correctly at different levels of
granularity. For example, both ``August 4, 1961'' and ``1961'' are correct
answers to the question ``When was Barack Obama born?''. Standard question
answering (QA) evaluation protocols, however, do not explicitly take this into
account and compare a predicted answer against answers of a single granularity
level. In this work, we propose GRANOLA QA, a novel evaluation setting where a
predicted answer is evaluated in terms of accuracy and informativeness against
a set of multi-granularity answers. We present a simple methodology for
enriching existing datasets with multi-granularity answers, and create
GRANOLA-EQ, a multi-granularity version of the EntityQuestions dataset. We
evaluate a range of decoding methods on GRANOLA-EQ, including a new algorithm,
called Decoding with Response Aggregation (DRAG), that is geared towards
aligning the response granularity with the model's uncertainty. Our experiments
show that large language models with standard decoding tend to generate
specific answers, which are often incorrect. In contrast, when evaluated on
multi-granularity answers, DRAG yields a nearly 20 point increase in accuracy
on average, which further increases for rare entities. Overall, this reveals
that standard evaluation and decoding schemes may significantly underestimate
the knowledge encapsulated in LMs.

<p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new paradigms
for accessing the knowledge stored in their parameters. One critical challenge
that has emerged is the presence of hallucinations in LLM outputs due to false
or outdated knowledge. Since retraining LLMs with updated information is
resource-intensive, there has been a growing interest in model editing.
However, many model editing methods, while effective in various scenarios, tend
to overemphasize aspects such as efficacy, generalization, and locality in
editing performance, often overlooking potential side effects on the general
abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we raise concerns that the improvement of
model factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of these
general abilities, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of
LLMs. Systematically, we analyze side effects by evaluating four popular
editing methods on two LLMs across eight representative task categories.
Extensive empirical research reveals that model editing does improve model
factuality but at the expense of substantially impairing general abilities.
Therefore, we advocate for more research efforts to minimize the loss of
general abilities acquired during LLM pre-training and to ultimately preserve
them during model editing.

<p>Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning is a popular fashion for large-scale
pretraining language models. However, the prior seq2seq pretraining models
generally focus on reconstructive objectives on the decoder side and neglect
the effect of encoder-side supervision, which we argue may lead to sub-optimal
performance. To verify our hypothesis, we first empirically study the
functionalities of the encoder and decoder in seq2seq pretrained language
models, and find that the encoder takes an important but under-exploitation
role than the decoder regarding the downstream performance and neuron
activation. Therefore, we propose an encoding-enhanced seq2seq pretraining
strategy, namely E2S2, which improves the seq2seq models via integrating more
efficient self-supervised information into the encoders. Specifically, E2S2
adopts two self-supervised objectives on the encoder side from two aspects: 1)
locally denoising the corrupted sentence (denoising objective); and 2) globally
learning better sentence representations (contrastive objective). With the help
of both objectives, the encoder can effectively distinguish the noise tokens
and capture high-level (i.e., syntactic and semantic) knowledge, thus
strengthening the ability of seq2seq model to accurately achieve the
conditional generation. On a large diversity of downstream natural language
understanding and generation tasks, E2S2 dominantly improves the performance of
its powerful backbone models, e.g., BART and T5. For example, upon BART
backbone, we achieve +1.1% averaged gain on the general language understanding
evaluation (GLUE) benchmark and +1.75% F_0.5 score improvement on CoNLL2014
dataset. We also provide in-depth analyses to show the improvement stems from
better linguistic representation. We hope that our work will foster future
self-supervision research on seq2seq language model pretraining.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12407">Entailment Semantics Can Be Extracted from an Ideal Language Model. (arXiv:2209.12407v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Language models are often trained on text alone, without additional
grounding. There is debate as to how much of natural language semantics can be
inferred from such a procedure. We prove that entailment judgments between
sentences can be extracted from an ideal language model that has perfectly
learned its target distribution, assuming the training sentences are generated
by Gricean agents, i.e., agents who follow fundamental principles of
communication from the linguistic theory of pragmatics. We also show entailment
judgments can be decoded from the predictions of a language model trained on
such Gricean data. Our results reveal a pathway for understanding the semantic
information encoded in unlabeled linguistic data and a potential framework for
extracting semantics from language models.

<p>Medical tabular data, abundant in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), is a
valuable resource for diverse medical tasks such as risk prediction. While deep
learning approaches, particularly transformer-based models, have shown
remarkable performance in tabular data prediction, there are still problems
remained for existing work to be effectively adapted into medical domain, such
as under-utilization of unstructured free-texts, limited exploration of textual
information in structured data, and data corruption. To address these issues,
we propose P-Transformer, a Prompt-based multimodal Transformer architecture
designed specifically for medical tabular data. This framework consists two
critical components: a tabular cell embedding generator and a tabular
transformer. The former efficiently encodes diverse modalities from both
structured and unstructured tabular data into a harmonized language semantic
space with the help of pre-trained sentence encoder and medical prompts. The
latter integrates cell representations to generate patient embeddings for
various medical tasks. In comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets
for three medical tasks, P-Transformer demonstrated the improvements with
10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE, 0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE, and 1.6%/0.8% on BACC/AUROC
compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in predictability. Notably, the
model exhibited strong resilience to data corruption in the structured data,
particularly when the corruption rates are high.

<p>Emotion recognition in conversations is challenging due to the multi-modal
nature of the emotion expression. We propose a hierarchical cross-attention
model (HCAM) approach to multi-modal emotion recognition using a combination of
recurrent and co-attention neural network models. The input to the model
consists of two modalities, i) audio data, processed through a learnable
wav2vec approach and, ii) text data represented using a bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) model. The audio and text
representations are processed using a set of bi-directional recurrent neural
network layers with self-attention that converts each utterance in a given
conversation to a fixed dimensional embedding. In order to incorporate
contextual knowledge and the information across the two modalities, the audio
and text embeddings are combined using a co-attention layer that attempts to
weigh the utterance level embeddings relevant to the task of emotion
recognition. The neural network parameters in the audio layers, text layers as
well as the multi-modal co-attention layers, are hierarchically trained for the
emotion classification task. We perform experiments on three established
datasets namely, IEMOCAP, MELD and CMU-MOSI, where we illustrate that the
proposed model improves significantly over other benchmarks and helps achieve
state-of-art results on all these datasets.

<p>We address the challenge of ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees in
training deep retrieval systems. Training these systems often involves the use
of contrastive-style losses, which are typically non-per-example decomposable,
making them difficult to directly DP-train with since common techniques require
per-example gradient. To address this issue, we propose an approach that
prioritizes ensuring query privacy prior to training a deep retrieval system.
Our method employs DP language models (LMs) to generate private synthetic
queries representative of the original data. These synthetic queries can be
used in downstream retrieval system training without compromising privacy. Our
approach demonstrates a significant enhancement in retrieval quality compared
to direct DP-training, all while maintaining query-level privacy guarantees.
This work highlights the potential of harnessing LMs to overcome limitations in
standard DP-training methods.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread deployment in various
real-world applications. Understanding these biases is crucial to comprehend
the potential downstream consequences when using LLMs to make decisions,
particularly for historically disadvantaged groups. In this work, we propose a
simple method for analyzing and comparing demographic bias in LLMs, through the
lens of job recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by
measuring intersectional biases within ChatGPT and LLaMA, two cutting-edge
LLMs. Our experiments primarily focus on uncovering gender identity and
nationality bias; however, our method can be extended to examine biases
associated with any intersection of demographic identities. We identify
distinct biases in both models toward various demographic identities, such as
both models consistently suggesting low-paying jobs for Mexican workers or
preferring to recommend secretarial roles to women. Our study highlights the
importance of measuring the bias of LLMs in downstream applications to
understand the potential for harm and inequitable outcomes.

<p>Although there have been remarkable advances in dialogue systems through the
dialogue systems technology competition (DSTC), it remains one of the key
challenges to building a robust task-oriented dialogue system with a speech
interface. Most of the progress has been made for text-based dialogue systems
since there are abundant datasets with written corpora while those with spoken
dialogues are very scarce. However, as can be seen from voice assistant systems
such as Siri and Alexa, it is of practical importance to transfer the success
to spoken dialogues. In this paper, we describe our engineering effort in
building a highly successful model that participated in the speech-aware
dialogue systems technology challenge track in DSTC11. Our model consists of
three major modules: (1) automatic speech recognition error correction to
bridge the gap between the spoken and the text utterances, (2) text-based
dialogue system (D3ST) for estimating the slots and values using slot
descriptions, and (3) post-processing for recovering the error of the estimated
slot value. Our experiments show that it is important to use an explicit
automatic speech recognition error correction module, post-processing, and data
augmentation to adapt a text-based dialogue state tracker for spoken dialogue
corpora.

<p>The reliance of text classifiers on spurious correlations can lead to poor
generalization at deployment, raising concerns about their use in
safety-critical domains such as healthcare. In this work, we propose to use
counterfactual data augmentation, guided by knowledge of the causal structure
of the data, to simulate interventions on spurious features and to learn more
robust text classifiers. We show that this strategy is appropriate in
prediction problems where the label is spuriously correlated with an attribute.
Under the assumptions of such problems, we discuss the favorable sample
complexity of counterfactual data augmentation, compared to importance
re-weighting. Pragmatically, we match examples using auxiliary data, based on
diff-in-diff methodology, and use a large language model (LLM) to represent a
conditional probability of text. Through extensive experimentation on learning
caregiver-invariant predictors of clinical diagnoses from medical narratives
and on semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate that our method for simulating
interventions improves out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy compared to baseline
invariant learning algorithms.

<p>Table-to-text systems generate natural language statements from structured
data like tables. While end-to-end techniques suffer from low factual
correctness (fidelity), a previous study reported gains when using manual
logical forms (LF) that represent the selected content and the semantics of the
target text. Given the manual step, it was not clear whether automatic LFs
would be effective, or whether the improvement came from content selection
alone. We present TlT which, given a table and a selection of the content,
first produces LFs and then the textual statement. We show for the first time
that automatic LFs improve quality, with an increase in fidelity of 30 points
over a comparable system not using LFs. Our experiments allow to quantify the
remaining challenges for high factual correctness, with automatic selection of
content coming first, followed by better Logic-to-Text generation and, to a
lesser extent, better Table-to-Logic parsing.

<p>While self-correction has shown promise in improving LLM outputs in terms of
style and quality (e.g. Chen et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023), recent
attempts to self-correct logical or reasoning errors often cause correct
answers to become incorrect, resulting in worse performances overall (Huang et
al., 2023). In this paper, we break down the self-correction process into two
core components: mistake finding and output correction. For mistake finding, we
release BIG-Bench Mistake, a dataset of logical mistakes in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning traces. We provide benchmark numbers for several state-of-the-art
LLMs, and demonstrate that LLMs generally struggle with finding logical
mistakes. For output correction, we propose a backtracking method which
provides large improvements when given information on mistake location. We
construe backtracking as a lightweight alternative to reinforcement learning

<p>Recently, the strong text creation ability of Large Language Models(LLMs) has
given rise to many tools for assisting paper reading or even writing. However,
the weak diagram analysis abilities of LLMs or Multimodal LLMs greatly limit
their application scenarios, especially for scientific academic paper writing.
In this work, towards a more versatile copilot for academic paper writing, we
mainly focus on strengthening the multi-modal diagram analysis ability of
Multimodal LLMs. By parsing Latex source files of high-quality papers, we
carefully build a multi-modal diagram understanding dataset M-Paper. By
aligning diagrams in the paper with related paragraphs, we construct
professional diagram analysis samples for training and evaluation. M-Paper is
the first dataset to support joint comprehension of multiple scientific
diagrams, including figures and tables in the format of images or Latex codes.
Besides, to better align the copilot with the user's intention, we introduce
the `outline' as the control signal, which could be directly given by the user
or revised based on auto-generated ones. Comprehensive experiments with a
state-of-the-art Mumtimodal LLM demonstrate that training on our dataset shows
stronger scientific diagram understanding performance, including diagram
captioning, diagram analysis, and outline recommendation. The dataset, code,

<p>Language models have been supervised with both language-only objective and
visual grounding in existing studies of visual-grounded language learning.
However, due to differences in the distribution and scale of visual-grounded
datasets and language corpora, the language model tends to mix up the context
of the tokens that occurred in the grounded data with those that do not. As a
result, during representation learning, there is a mismatch between the visual
information and the contextual meaning of the sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose GroundedBERT - a grounded language learning method that
enhances the BERT representation with visually grounded information.
GroundedBERT comprises two components: (i) the original BERT which captures the
contextual representation of words learned from the language corpora, and (ii)
a visual grounding module which captures visual information learned from
visual-grounded datasets. Moreover, we employ Optimal Transport (OT),
specifically its partial variant, to solve the fractional alignment problem
between the two modalities. Our proposed method significantly outperforms the
baseline language models on various language tasks of the GLUE and SQuAD
datasets.

we design multiple-choice tasks to probe its intrinsic understanding in
high-order tasks such as reasoning and computation. We examine the model
horizontally, comparing different sizes, and vertically, assessing different
layers. We unveil several key and uncommon findings based on the designed
probing tasks: (1) Horizontally, enlarging model sizes almost could not
automatically impart additional knowledge or computational prowess. Instead, it
can enhance reasoning abilities, especially in math problem solving, and helps
reduce hallucinations, but only beyond certain size thresholds; (2) In vertical
analysis, the lower layers of LLaMA lack substantial arithmetic and factual
knowledge, showcasing logical thinking, multilingual and recognitive abilities,
with top layers housing most computational power and real-world knowledge.

<p>In-Context Learning (ICL) is an important paradigm for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks through a few demonstrations.
Despite the great success of ICL, the limitation of the demonstration number
may lead to demonstration bias, i.e. the input-label mapping induced by LLMs
misunderstands the task's essence. Inspired by human experience, we attempt to
mitigate such bias through the perspective of the inter-demonstration
relationship. Specifically, we construct Comparable Demonstrations (CDs) by
minimally editing the texts to flip the corresponding labels, in order to
highlight the task's essence and eliminate potential spurious correlations
through the inter-demonstration comparison. Through a series of experiments on
CDs, we find that (1) demonstration bias does exist in LLMs, and CDs can
significantly reduce such bias; (2) CDs exhibit good performance in ICL,
especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. In summary, this study explores
the ICL mechanisms from a novel perspective, providing a deeper insight into
the demonstration selection strategy for ICL.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still
remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied
this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can
change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one.
Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive
conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer
correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which
contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive
misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief
changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that
LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various
persuasive strategies.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting significant research attention
due to their instruction-following abilities, allowing users and developers to
leverage LLMs for a variety of tasks. However, LLMs are vulnerable to
prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's
instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired,
possibly malicious ones. In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for
generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks. Jatmo
leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have
undergone instruction tuning. It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to
generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model
(i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model). Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a
dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs.
For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example,
or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset. Our
experiments on seven tasks show that Jatmo models provide similar quality of
outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to
prompt injections. The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases
against our models, versus 87% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo. We release
Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense.

<p>Recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
generative agents. Among them, Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs)
attract considerable attention due to their ability to emotionally engage
users. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark impedes progress in
this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CharacterEval, a Chinese benchmark
for comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality
dataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues,
encompassing 23,020 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese
novels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial
dialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control,
and enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike.
CharacterEval employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen
targeted metrics on four dimensions. Comprehensive experiments on CharacterEval
demonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in
Chinese role-playing conversation. Source code, data source and reward model
will be publicly accessible at https://github.com/morecry/CharacterEval.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in
understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.
However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands
during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge
is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating
frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new
knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many
applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address
deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in
efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end,
recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for
LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains
while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we
first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive
review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and
cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that
classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external
knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.
Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.
Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can
give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs.
Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,
outlining its broad and impactful implications.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01854">Multilingual Instruction Tuning With Just a Pinch of Multilinguality. (arXiv:2401.01854v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their
ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly
crucial. One promising approach is cross-lingual transfer, where a model
acquires specific functionality on some language by finetuning on another
language. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction
tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages. We
first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities
to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only
40 multilingual examples in an English tuning set substantially improve
multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during
tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures
exhibit comparable or superior performance in several languages compared to
monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those
languages. Finally, we find that increasing the number of languages in the
instruction tuning set from 1 to only 2, 3, or 4 increases cross-lingual
generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual
instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual
instruction-responses.

<p>In conversational AI research, there's a noticeable trend towards developing
models with a larger number of parameters, exemplified by models like ChatGPT.
While these expansive models tend to generate increasingly better chat
responses, they demand significant computational resources and memory. This
study explores a pertinent question: Can a combination of smaller models
collaboratively achieve comparable or enhanced performance relative to a
singular large model? We introduce an approach termed "blending", a
straightforward yet effective method of integrating multiple chat AIs. Our
empirical evidence suggests that when specific smaller models are
synergistically blended, they can potentially outperform or match the
capabilities of much larger counterparts. For instance, integrating just three
models of moderate size (6B/13B paramaeters) can rival or even surpass the
performance metrics of a substantially larger model like ChatGPT (175B+
paramaters). This hypothesis is rigorously tested using A/B testing
methodologies with a large user base on the Chai research platform over a span
of thirty days. The findings underscore the potential of the "blending"
strategy as a viable approach for enhancing chat AI efficacy without a
corresponding surge in computational demands.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03512">Token-free LLMs Can Generate Chinese Classical Poetry with More Accurate Format. (arXiv:2401.03512v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Finetuned large language models (such as ChatGPT and Qwen-chat) can generate
Chinese classical poetry following human's instructions. LLMs perform well in
content, but are usually lacking in format, with occasionally excess or
insufficient number of characters in each line. Since most SOTA LLMs are
token-based, we assume that the format inaccuracy is due to the difficulty of
the "token planning" task, which means that the LLM need to know exactly how
much characters are contained in each token and do length-control planning
based on that knowledge. In this paper, we first confirm our assumption by
showing that existing token-based large language models has limited knowledge
on token-character relationship. We use a spelling bee probing procedure, and
find that Qwen-chat failed in nearly 15% Chinese spelling test. We then show
that a token-based model can be easily tailored into a token-free model (in
terms of Chinese), which can largely solve the format accuracy problem. Our
tailoring procedure removes long-tokens from the vocabulary and the language
model head, and keeps only character-level or byte-level tokens. As part of our
contribution, we release the finetuned token-free model (which is based on
Qwen-chat-7B), which can generate chinese classical poetry following complex
instructions like LLMs (such as story paraphrasing), and also perform well in
format. On the test set, our token-free model achives an format accuracy of
0.96, compared to 0.84 for token-based equivalents and 0.38 for GPT-4.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03514">ROIC-DM: Robust Text Inference and Classification via Diffusion Model. (arXiv:2401.03514v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>While language models have made many milestones in text inference and
classification tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that can
lead to unforeseen outcomes. Existing works alleviate this problem by equipping
language models with defense patches. However, these defense strategies often
rely on impractical assumptions or entail substantial sacrifices in model
performance. Consequently, enhancing the resilience of the target model using
such defense mechanisms is a formidable challenge. This paper introduces an
innovative model for robust text inference and classification, built upon
diffusion models (ROIC-DM). Benefiting from its training involving denoising
stages, ROIC-DM inherently exhibits greater robustness compared to conventional
language models. Moreover, ROIC-DM can attain comparable, and in some cases,
superior performance to language models, by effectively incorporating them as
advisory components. Extensive experiments conducted with several strong
textual adversarial attacks on three datasets demonstrate that (1) ROIC-DM
outperforms traditional language models in robustness, even when the latter are
fortified with advanced defense mechanisms; (2) ROIC-DM can achieve comparable
and even better performance than traditional language models by using them as
advisors.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03729">The Butterfly Effect of Altering Prompts: How Small Changes and Jailbreaks Affect Large Language Model Performance. (arXiv:2401.03729v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are regularly being used to label data across
many domains and for myriad tasks. By simply asking the LLM for an answer, or
``prompting,'' practitioners are able to use LLMs to quickly get a response for
an arbitrary task. This prompting is done through a series of decisions by the
practitioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to requesting the output in a
certain data format, to jailbreaking in the case of prompts that address more
sensitive topics. In this work, we ask: do variations in the way a prompt is
constructed change the ultimate decision of the LLM? We answer this using a
series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks. We
find that even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end
of a prompt, can cause the LLM to change its answer. Further, we find that
requesting responses in XML and commonly used jailbreaks can have cataclysmic
effects on the data labeled by LLMs.
