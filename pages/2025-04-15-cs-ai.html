<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Rachmut, Roie Zivan, William Yeoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers recently extended Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) to Communication-Aware DCOPs so that they are applicable in scenarios in which messages can be arbitrarily delayed. Distributed asynchronous local search and inference algorithms designed for CA-DCOPs are less vulnerable to message latency than their counterparts for regular DCOPs. However, unlike local search algorithms for (regular) DCOPs that converge to k-opt solutions (with k > 1), that is, they converge to solutions that cannot be improved by a group of k agents), local search CA-DCOP algorithms are limited to 1-opt solutions only. In this paper, we introduce Latency-Aware Monotonic Distributed Local Search-2 (LAMDLS-2), where agents form pairs and coordinate bilateral assignment replacements. LAMDLS-2 is monotonic, converges to a 2-opt solution, and is also robust to message latency, making it suitable for CA-DCOPs. Our results indicate that LAMDLS-2 converges faster than MGM-2, a benchmark algorithm, to a similar 2-opt solution, in various message latency scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan Chipka, Chris Moyer, Clay Troyer, Tyler Fuelling, Jeremy Hochstedler</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of big data and advancements in computational techniques have significantly transformed sports analytics. However, the diverse range of data sources -- including structured statistics, semi-structured formats like sensor data, and unstructured media such as written articles, audio, and video -- creates substantial challenges in extracting actionable insights. These various formats, often referred to as multimodal data, require integration to fully leverage their potential. Conventional systems, which typically prioritize structured data, face limitations when processing and combining these diverse content types, reducing their effectiveness in real-time sports analysis.
  To address these challenges, recent research highlights the importance of multimodal data integration for capturing the complexity of real-world sports environments. Building on this foundation, this paper introduces GridMind, a multi-agent framework that unifies structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to facilitate natural language querying of NFL data. This approach aligns with the evolving field of multimodal representation learning, where unified models are increasingly essential for real-time, cross-modal interactions.
  GridMind's distributed architecture includes specialized agents that autonomously manage each stage of a prompt -- from interpretation and data retrieval to response synthesis. This modular design enables flexible, scalable handling of multimodal data, allowing users to pose complex, context-rich questions and receive comprehensive, intuitive responses via a conversational interface.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08806">Endowing Embodied Agents with Spatial Reasoning Capabilities for Vision-and-Language Navigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luo Ling, Bai Qianqian</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the spatial perception capabilities of mobile robots is crucial for achieving embodied Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Although significant progress has been made in simulated environments, directly transferring these capabilities to real-world scenarios often results in severe hallucination phenomena, causing robots to lose effective spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose BrainNav, a bio-inspired spatial cognitive navigation framework inspired by biological spatial cognition theories and cognitive map theory. BrainNav integrates dual-map (coordinate map and topological map) and dual-orientation (relative orientation and absolute orientation) strategies, enabling real-time navigation through dynamic scene capture and path planning. Its five core modules-Hippocampal Memory Hub, Visual Cortex Perception Engine, Parietal Spatial Constructor, Prefrontal Decision Center, and Cerebellar Motion Execution Unit-mimic biological cognitive functions to reduce spatial hallucinations and enhance adaptability. Validated in a zero-shot real-world lab environment using the Limo Pro robot, BrainNav, compatible with GPT-4, outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) methods without fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Islam Mansour, Georg Fischer, Ronny Haensch, Irena Hajnsek</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital elevation models derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data over glacial and snow-covered regions often exhibit systematic elevation errors, commonly termed "penetration bias." We leverage existing physics-based models and propose an integrated correction framework that combines parametric physical modeling with machine learning. We evaluate the approach across three distinct training scenarios - each defined by a different set of acquisition parameters - to assess overall performance and the model's ability to generalize. Our experiments on Greenland's ice sheet using TanDEM-X data show that the proposed hybrid model corrections significantly reduce the mean and standard deviation of DEM errors compared to a purely physical modeling baseline. The hybrid framework also achieves significantly improved generalization than a pure ML approach when trained on data with limited diversity in acquisition parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouya Pezeshkpour, Moin Aminnaseri, Estevam Hruschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance by effectively integrating visual and textual information to solve complex tasks. However, it is not clear how these models reason over the visual and textual data together, nor how the flow of information between modalities is structured. In this paper, we examine how VLMs reason by analyzing their biases when confronted with scenarios that present conflicting image and text cues, a common occurrence in real-world applications. To uncover the extent and nature of these biases, we build upon existing benchmarks to create five datasets containing mismatched image-text pairs, covering topics in mathematics, science, and visual descriptions. Our analysis shows that VLMs favor text in simpler queries but shift toward images as query complexity increases. This bias correlates with model scale, with the difference between the percentage of image- and text-preferred responses ranging from +56.8% (image favored) to -74.4% (text favored), depending on the task and model. In addition, we explore three mitigation strategies: simple prompt modifications, modifications that explicitly instruct models on how to handle conflicting information (akin to chain-of-thought prompting), and a task decomposition strategy that analyzes each modality separately before combining their results. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these strategies in identifying and mitigating bias varies significantly and is closely linked to the model's overall performance on the task and the specific modality in question.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Ke, Fangkai Jiao, Yifei Ming, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Austin Xu, Do Xuan Long, Minzhi Li, Chengwei Qin, Peifeng Wang, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoqi Wang, Jiawei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In container terminal yards, the Container Rehandling Problem (CRP) involves rearranging containers between stacks under specific operational rules, and it is a pivotal optimization challenge in intelligent container scheduling systems. Existing CRP studies primarily focus on minimizing reallocation costs using two-dimensional bay structures, considering factors such as container size, weight, arrival sequences, and retrieval priorities. This paper introduces an enhanced deepening search algorithm integrated with improved lower bounds to boost search efficiency. To further reduce the search space, we design mutually consistent pruning rules to avoid excessive computational overhead. The proposed algorithm is validated on three widely used benchmark datasets for the Unrestricted Container Rehandling Problem (UCRP). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art exact algorithms in solving the more general UCRP variant, particularly exhibiting superior efficiency when handling containers within the same priority group under strict time constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyuan Liu, Shihang Wang, Lizhi Qing, Kaisong Song, Junjie Cao, Jun Lin, Ji Zhang, Ang Li, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, stepwise supervision on Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) presents an enhancement on the logical reasoning tasks such as coding and math, with the help of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, its contribution to tasks requiring domain-specific expertise and knowledge remains unexplored. Motivated by the interest, we identify several potential challenges of vanilla MCTS within this context, and propose the framework of Stepwise Domain Knowledge-Driven Reasoning Optimization, employing the MCTS algorithm to develop step-level supervision for problems that require essential comprehension, reasoning, and specialized knowledge. Additionally, we also introduce the Preference Optimization towards Reflection Paths, which iteratively learns self-reflection on the reasoning thoughts from better perspectives. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the advantage of the methodologies. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness on various legal-domain problems. We also report a diverse set of valuable findings, hoping to encourage the enthusiasm to the research of domain-specific LLMs and MCTS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, have seen significant advancements through the slow thinking process. Despite these achievements, the substantial computational demands of LRMs present considerable challenges. In contrast, small reasoning models (SRMs), often distilled from larger ones, offer greater efficiency and can exhibit distinct capabilities and cognitive trajectories compared to LRMs. This work surveys around 170 recently published papers on SRMs for tackling various complex reasoning tasks. We review the current landscape of SRMs and analyze diverse training and inference techniques related to SRMs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of SRMs for domain-specific applications and discuss possible future research directions. This survey serves as an essential reference for researchers to leverage or develop SRMs for advanced reasoning functionalities with high efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxu Lu, Kaisen Yang, Dong Yang, Haifeng Ding, Jinxian Weng, Ryan Wen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring maritime safety and optimizing traffic management in increasingly crowded and complex waterways require effective waterway monitoring. However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09301">Continuum-Interaction-Driven Intelligence: Human-Aligned Neural Architecture via Crystallized Reasoning and Fluid Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Zhou, Zhiqiang Nie, Haochen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Current AI systems based on probabilistic neural networks, such as large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities yet face critical challenges including hallucination, unpredictability, and misalignment with human decision-making. These issues fundamentally stem from the over-reliance on randomized (probabilistic) neural networks-oversimplified models of biological neural networks-while neglecting the role of procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) in trustworthy decision-making. Inspired by the human cognitive duality of fluid intelligence (flexible generation) and crystallized intelligence (structured knowledge), this study proposes a dual-channel intelligent architecture that integrates probabilistic generation (LLMs) with white-box procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) to construct interpretable, continuously learnable, and human-aligned AI systems. Concretely, this work: (1) redefines chain-of-thought as a programmable crystallized intelligence carrier, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and decision verification through multi-turn interaction frameworks; (2) introduces a task-driven modular network design that explicitly demarcates the functional boundaries between randomized generation and procedural control to address trustworthiness in vertical-domain applications; (3) demonstrates that multi-turn interaction is a necessary condition for intelligence emergence, with dialogue depth positively correlating with the system's human-alignment degree. This research not only establishes a new paradigm for trustworthy AI deployment but also provides theoretical foundations for next-generation human-AI collaborative systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junichiro Takahashi, JingChuan Guan, Masataka Sato, Kaito Baba, Kazuto Haruguchi, Daichi Nagashima, Satoshi Kodera, Norihiko Takeda</p>
<p>Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fundamental tool in cardiovascular diagnostics due to its powerful and non-invasive nature. One of the most critical usages is to determine whether more detailed examinations are necessary, with users ranging across various levels of expertise. Given this diversity in expertise, it is essential to assist users to avoid critical errors. Recent studies in machine learning have addressed this challenge by extracting valuable information from ECG data. Utilizing language models, these studies have implemented multimodal models aimed at classifying ECGs according to labeled terms. However, the number of classes was reduced, and it remains uncertain whether the technique is effective for languages other than English. To move towards practical application, we utilized ECG data from regular patients visiting hospitals in Japan, maintaining a large number of Japanese labels obtained from actual ECG readings. Using a contrastive learning framework, we found that even with 98 labels for classification, our Japanese-based language model achieves accuracy comparable to previous research. This study extends the applicability of multimodal machine learning frameworks to broader clinical studies and non-English languages.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09440">Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Self-Consistency-Based Hallucination Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> MingShan Liu, Shi Bo, Jialing Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning capabilities but remain susceptible to hallucinations producing plausible yet incorrect statements especially in theorem proving, symbolic manipulation, and numerical computation. While self-consistency (SC) has been explored as a means to improve factuality in LLMs, existing approaches primarily apply SC to final-answer selection, neglecting the logical consistency of intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we introduce a structured self-consistency framework designed to enhance the reliability of mathematical reasoning. Our method enforces self-consistency across intermediate steps and final outputs, reducing logical inconsistencies and hallucinations. We evaluate our approach across three core mathematical tasks: theorem proving, symbolic transformation, and numerical computation. Experimental results demonstrate that SC significantly improves proof validity, symbolic reasoning accuracy, and numerical stability while maintaining computational efficiency. Further analysis reveals that structured self-consistency not only enhances problem-solving accuracy but also reduces the variance of model-generated outputs. These findings highlight self-consistency as a robust mechanism for improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable AI-driven mathematics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengkun Jiao, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Chong-Wah Ngo, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their vulnerability to user gaslighting-the deliberate use of misleading or contradictory inputs-raises critical concerns about their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we address the novel and challenging issue of mitigating the negative impact of negation-based gaslighting on LMMs, where deceptive user statements lead to significant drops in model accuracy. Specifically, we introduce GasEraser, a training-free approach that reallocates attention weights from misleading textual tokens to semantically salient visual regions. By suppressing the influence of "attention sink" tokens and enhancing focus on visually grounded cues, GasEraser significantly improves LMM robustness without requiring retraining or additional supervision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GasEraser is effective across several leading open-source LMMs on the GaslightingBench. Notably, for LLaVA-v1.5-7B, GasEraser reduces the misguidance rate by 48.2%, demonstrating its potential for more trustworthy LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqing Cui, Jiahao Yuan, Hanqing Wang, Yanshu Li, Chenxu Du, Zhenglong Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimization algorithms are essential for solving many real-world problems. However, challenges such as premature convergence to local optima and the difficulty of effectively balancing exploration and exploitation often hinder their performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved FOX optimization algorithm, Improved FOX (IFOX). The IFOX algorithm introduces a new adaptive mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation based on fitness values. It also reduces the number of hyperparameters and simplifies the core equations of the original FOX. To evaluate its effectiveness, IFOX has been tested on classical uni-modal and multi-modal benchmark functions, as well as on benchmark sets from the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), in addition to two engineering design problems: Pressure Vessel Design and Economic Load Dispatch. The results show that IFOX outperforms existing optimization algorithms, achieving superior results on 51 benchmark functions. These findings underscore the strong potential of IFOX as a competitive and robust optimization algorithm for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Theodoropoulos, Andrei Catalin Coman, James Henderson, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge discovery is hindered by the increasing volume of publications and the scarcity of extensive annotated data. To tackle the challenge of information overload, it is essential to employ automated methods for knowledge extraction and processing. Finding the right balance between the level of supervision and the effectiveness of models poses a significant challenge. While supervised techniques generally result in better performance, they have the major drawback of demanding labeled data. This requirement is labor-intensive and time-consuming and hinders scalability when exploring new domains. In this context, our study addresses the challenge of identifying semantic relationships between biomedical entities (e.g., diseases, proteins) in unstructured text while minimizing dependency on supervision. We introduce a suite of unsupervised algorithms based on dependency trees and attention mechanisms and employ a range of pointwise binary classification methods. Transitioning from weakly supervised to fully unsupervised settings, we assess the methods' ability to learn from data with noisy labels. The evaluation on biomedical benchmark datasets explores the effectiveness of the methods. Our approach tackles a central issue in knowledge discovery: balancing performance with minimal supervision. By gradually decreasing supervision, we assess the robustness of pointwise binary classification techniques in handling noisy labels, revealing their capability to shift from weakly supervised to entirely unsupervised scenarios. Comprehensive benchmarking offers insights into the effectiveness of these techniques, suggesting an encouraging direction toward adaptable knowledge discovery systems, representing progress in creating data-efficient methodologies for extracting useful insights when annotated data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wan Borui, Zhao Juntao, Jiang Chenyu, Guo Chuanxiong, Wu Chuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Pan, Shaowen Wang, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09635">A Two-Stage Interpretable Matching Framework for Causal Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Shikalgar, Md. Noor-E-Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Matching in causal inference from observational data aims to construct treatment and control groups with similar distributions of covariates, thereby reducing confounding and ensuring an unbiased estimation of treatment effects. This matched sample closely mimics a randomized controlled trial (RCT), thus improving the quality of causal estimates. We introduce a novel Two-stage Interpretable Matching (TIM) framework for transparent and interpretable covariate matching. In the first stage, we perform exact matching across all available covariates. For treatment and control units without an exact match in the first stage, we proceed to the second stage. Here, we iteratively refine the matching process by removing the least significant confounder in each iteration and attempting exact matching on the remaining covariates. We learn a distance metric for the dropped covariates to quantify closeness to the treatment unit(s) within the corresponding strata. We used these high- quality matches to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). To validate TIM, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with varying association structures and correlations. We assessed its performance by measuring bias in CATE estimation and evaluating multivariate overlap between treatment and control groups before and after matching. Additionally, we apply TIM to a real-world healthcare dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to estimate the causal effect of high cholesterol on diabetes. Our results demonstrate that TIM improves CATE estimates, increases multivariate overlap, and scales effectively to high-dimensional data, making it a robust tool for causal inference in observational data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Tang, Mengbang Zou, Udhaya Chandhar Srinivasan, Obumneme Umealor, Dennis Kevogo, Benjamin James Scott, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient orchestration of AI services in 6G AI-RAN requires well-structured, ready-to-deploy AI service repositories combined with orchestration methods adaptive to diverse runtime contexts across radio access, edge, and cloud layers. Current literature lacks comprehensive frameworks for constructing such repositories and generally overlooks key practical orchestration factors. This paper systematically identifies and categorizes critical attributes influencing AI service orchestration in 6G networks and introduces an open-source, LLM-assisted toolchain that automates service packaging, deployment, and runtime profiling. We validate the proposed toolchain through the Cranfield AI Service repository case study, demonstrating significant automation benefits, reduced manual coding efforts, and the necessity of infrastructure-specific profiling, paving the way for more practical orchestration frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qiu, Yinghui He, Xinzhe Juan, Yiming Wang, Yuhan Liu, Zixin Yao, Yue Wu, Xun Jiang, Ling Yang, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunxiang Zhang, Muhammad Khalifa, Shitanshu Bhushan, Grant D Murphy, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Jaekyeom Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents on scientific discovery lacks objective baselines and metrics to assess the viability of their proposed methods. To address this issue, we introduce MLRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions. Our benchmark highlights open research problems that demand novel methodologies, in contrast to recent benchmarks such as OpenAI's MLE-Bench (Chan et al., 2024) and METR's RE-Bench (Wijk et al., 2024), which focus on well-established research tasks that are largely solvable through sufficient engineering effort. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024b), which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with newly proposed rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB (Huang et al., 2024a)) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and their actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, which is designed to continually grow with new ML competitions to encourage rigorous and objective evaluations of AI's research capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard multimodal self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms regard cross-modal synchronization as implicit supervisory labels during pretraining, thus posing high requirements on the scale and quality of multimodal samples. These constraints significantly limit the performance of sensing intelligence in IoT applications, as the heterogeneity and the non-interpretability of time-series signals result in abundant unimodal data but scarce high-quality multimodal pairs. This paper proposes InfoMAE, a cross-modal alignment framework that tackles the challenge of multimodal pair efficiency under the SSL setting by facilitating efficient cross-modal alignment of pretrained unimodal representations. InfoMAE achieves \textit{efficient cross-modal alignment} with \textit{limited data pairs} through a novel information theory-inspired formulation that simultaneously addresses distribution-level and instance-level alignment. Extensive experiments on two real-world IoT applications are performed to evaluate InfoMAE's pairing efficiency to bridge pretrained unimodal models into a cohesive joint multimodal model. InfoMAE enhances downstream multimodal tasks by over 60% with significantly improved multimodal pairing efficiency. It also improves unimodal task accuracy by an average of 22%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitya Thakkar, Mert Yuksekgonul, Jake Silberg, Animesh Garg, Nanyun Peng, Fei Sha, Rose Yu, Carl Vondrick, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer review at AI conferences is stressed by rapidly rising submission volumes, leading to deteriorating review quality and increased author dissatisfaction. To address these issues, we developed Review Feedback Agent, a system leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve review clarity and actionability by providing automated feedback on vague comments, content misunderstandings, and unprofessional remarks to reviewers. Implemented at ICLR 2025 as a large randomized control study, our system provided optional feedback to more than 20,000 randomly selected reviews. To ensure high-quality feedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated reliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback quality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests. The results show that 27% of reviewers who received feedback updated their reviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated by those reviewers. This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated feedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews. Incorporating AI feedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words among those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews, as evaluated by blinded researchers. Moreover, reviewers who were selected to receive AI feedback were also more engaged during paper rebuttals, as seen in longer author-reviewer discussions. This work demonstrates that carefully designed LLM-generated review feedback can enhance peer review quality by making reviews more specific and actionable while increasing engagement between reviewers and authors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Jin, Hongwu Peng, Qixin Zhang, Yujin Tang, Dimitris N. Metaxas, Tong Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward solving complex, real-world tasks that single-agent systems often struggle to manage. While recent advancements in test-time scaling (TTS) have significantly improved single-agent performance on challenging reasoning tasks, how to effectively scale collaboration and reasoning in MAS remains an open question. In this work, we introduce an adaptive multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative reasoning through both model-level training and system-level coordination. We construct M500, a high-quality dataset containing 500 multi-agent collaborative reasoning traces, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on this dataset to produce M1-32B, a model optimized for multi-agent collaboration. To further enable adaptive reasoning, we propose a novel CEO agent that dynamically manages the discussion process, guiding agent collaboration and adjusting reasoning depth for more effective problem-solving. Evaluated in an open-source MAS across a range of tasks-including general understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding-our system significantly outperforms strong baselines. For instance, M1-32B achieves 12% improvement on GPQA-Diamond, 41% on AIME2024, and 10% on MBPP-Sanitized, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 on some tasks. These results highlight the importance of both learned collaboration and adaptive coordination in scaling multi-agent reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/MAS-TTS</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past year, the development of large language models (LLMs) has brought spatial intelligence into focus, with much attention on vision-based embodied intelligence. However, spatial intelligence spans a broader range of disciplines and scales, from navigation and urban planning to remote sensing and earth science. What are the differences and connections between spatial intelligence across these fields? In this paper, we first review human spatial cognition and its implications for spatial intelligence in LLMs. We then examine spatial memory, knowledge representations, and abstract reasoning in LLMs, highlighting their roles and connections. Finally, we analyze spatial intelligence across scales -- from embodied to urban and global levels -- following a framework that progresses from spatial memory and understanding to spatial reasoning and intelligence. Through this survey, we aim to provide insights into interdisciplinary spatial intelligence research and inspire future studies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09858">Reasoning Models Can Be Effective Without Thinking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Ma, Jingxuan He, Charlie Snell, Tyler Griggs, Sewon Min, Matei Zaharia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent LLMs have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, primarily by including an explicit, lengthy Thinking process as part of generation. In this paper, we question whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Zhu, Chenmien Tan, Pinzhen Chen, Rico Sennrich, Yanlin Zhang, Hanxu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback by serving as proxies for human preferences in aligning large language models. In this paper, we identify a model preference bias in RMs, where they systematically assign disproportionately high scores to responses from certain policy models. This bias distorts ranking evaluations and leads to unfair judgments. To address this issue, we propose a calibration method named CHatbot Arena calibrated Reward Modeling (CHARM) that leverages Elo scores from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard to mitigate RM overvaluation. We also introduce a Mismatch Degree metric to measure this preference bias. Our approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a small preference dataset for continued training of the RM. We conduct extensive experiments on reward model benchmarks and human preference alignment. Results demonstrate that our calibrated RMs (1) achieve improved evaluation accuracy on RM-Bench and the Chat-Hard domain of RewardBench, and (2) exhibit a stronger correlation with human preferences by producing scores more closely aligned with Elo rankings. By mitigating model preference bias, our method provides a generalizable and efficient solution for building fairer and more reliable reward models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tien Pham, Angelo Cangelosi</p>
<p>Abstract: Current approaches in Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning have limitations in which the attention mask has a displacement with the objects in visual input. This work addresses a spatial problem within traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We propose the Interpretable Feature Extractor (IFE) architecture, aimed at generating an accurate attention mask to illustrate both "what" and "where" the agent concentrates on in the spatial domain. Our design incorporates a Human-Understandable Encoding module to generate a fully interpretable attention mask, followed by an Agent-Friendly Encoding module to enhance the agent's learning efficiency. These two components together form the Interpretable Feature Extractor for vision-based deep reinforcement learning to enable the model's interpretability. The resulting attention mask is consistent, highly understandable by humans, accurate in spatial dimension, and effectively highlights important objects or locations in visual input. The Interpretable Feature Extractor is integrated into the Fast and Data-efficient Rainbow framework, and evaluated on 57 ATARI games to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on Spatial Preservation, Interpretability, and Data-efficiency. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by incorporating the IFE into the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic Model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ling, Zhiyao Guo, Yixuan Huang, Yi An, Shuai Xiao, Jinsong Lan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs have been remarkable. However, these models still rely solely on their parametric knowledge, which limits their ability to generate up-to-date information and increases the risk of producing erroneous content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates these challenges by incorporating external data sources, yet the reliance on databases and retrieval systems can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate documents, ultimately undermining both performance and reasoning quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Knowledge-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMKB-RAG), a novel multi-modal RAG framework that leverages the inherent knowledge boundaries of models to dynamically generate semantic tags for the retrieval process. This strategy enables the joint filtering of retrieved documents, retaining only the most relevant and accurate references. Extensive experiments on knowledge-based visual question-answering tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach: on the E-VQA dataset, our method improves performance by +4.2\% on the Single-Hop subset and +0.4\% on the full dataset, while on the InfoSeek dataset, it achieves gains of +7.8\% on the Unseen-Q subset, +8.2\% on the Unseen-E subset, and +8.1\% on the full dataset. These results highlight significant enhancements in both accuracy and robustness over the current state-of-the-art MLLM and RAG frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have been rapidly progressing and achieving breakthrough performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, the open-source R1 models have raised safety concerns in wide applications, such as the tendency to comply with malicious queries, which greatly impacts the utility of these powerful models in their applications. In this paper, we introduce RealSafe-R1 as safety-aligned versions of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models. To train these models, we construct a dataset of 15k safety-aware reasoning trajectories generated by DeepSeek-R1, under explicit instructions for expected refusal behavior. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies demonstrate the models' improvements, which are shown in their safety guardrails against both harmful queries and jailbreak attacks. Importantly, unlike prior safety alignment efforts that often compromise reasoning performance, our method preserves the models' reasoning capabilities by maintaining the training data within the original distribution of generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlei Zhang, Zichen Ding, Chang Ma, Zijie Chen, Qiushi Sun, Zhenzhong Lan, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents offer cross-platform solutions for automating complex digital tasks, with significant potential to transform productivity workflows. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11 mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data scarcity challenges in this emerging field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwesha Mohanty, Venkatesh Balavadhani Parthasarathy, Arsalan Shahid</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are set to transform how machines process and generate human-like responses by integrating diverse modalities such as text, images, and code. Yet, effectively harnessing their capabilities hinges on optimal prompt engineering. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of seven prompt engineering methods applied to 13 open-source MLLMs over 24 tasks spanning Reasoning and Compositionality, Multimodal Understanding and Alignment, Complex Code Generation and Execution, and Knowledge Retrieval and Integration. Our approach stratifies models by parameter count into Small (<4B), Medium (4B-10B), and Large (>10B) categories and compares prompting techniques including Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Analogical, Generated Knowledge, and Tree-of-Thought. While Large MLLMs excel in structured tasks such as code generation, achieving accuracies up to 96.88% under Few-Shot prompting, all models struggle with complex reasoning and abstract understanding, often yielding accuracies below 60% and high hallucination rates. Structured reasoning prompts frequently increased hallucination up to 75% in small models and led to longer response times (over 20 seconds in Large MLLMs), while simpler prompting methods provided more concise and efficient outputs. No single prompting method uniformly optimises all task types. Instead, adaptive strategies combining example-based guidance with selective structured reasoning are essential to enhance robustness, efficiency, and factual accuracy. Our findings offer practical recommendations for prompt engineering and support more reliable deployment of MLLMs across applications including AI-assisted coding, knowledge retrieval, and multimodal content understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhang, Yangyang Feng, Daifeng Li, Kexin Zhang, Junlan Chen, Bowen Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agents-based news-driven time series forecasting is considered as a potential paradigm shift in the era of large language models (LLMs). The challenge of this task lies in measuring the influences of different news events towards the fluctuations of time series. This requires agents to possess stronger abilities of innovative thinking and the identifying misleading logic. However, the existing multi-agent discussion framework has limited enhancement on time series prediction in terms of optimizing these two capabilities. Inspired by the role of competition in fostering innovation, this study embeds a competition mechanism within the multi-agent discussion to enhance agents' capability of generating innovative thoughts. Furthermore, to bolster the model's proficiency in identifying misleading information, we incorporate a fine-tuned small-scale LLM model within the reflective stage, offering auxiliary decision-making support. Experimental results confirm that the competition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can significantly improve the performances of time series prediction. Similar to the findings of social science, the intensity of competition within this framework can influence the performances of agents, providing a new perspective for studying LLMs-based multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlei Shi, Xing Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olha Shaposhnyk, Daria Zahorska, Svetlana Yanushkevich</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to human expert elicitation for extracting structured causal knowledge and facilitating causal modeling in biometric and healthcare applications.
  Material and Methods: LLM-generated causal structures, specifically Bayesian networks (BNs), were benchmarked against traditional statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion) using healthcare datasets. Validation techniques included structural equation modeling (SEM) to verifying relationships, and measures such as entropy, predictive accuracy, and robustness to compare network structures.
  Results and Discussion: LLM-generated BNs demonstrated lower entropy than expert-elicited and statistically generated BNs, suggesting higher confidence and precision in predictions. However, limitations such as contextual constraints, hallucinated dependencies, and potential biases inherited from training data require further investigation.
  Conclusion: LLMs represent a novel frontier in expert elicitation for probabilistic causal modeling, promising to improve transparency and reduce uncertainty in the decision-making using such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyu Ye, Haojun Shi, Darren Shih, Hyokun Yun, Tanya Roosta, Tianmin Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: To achieve successful assistance with long-horizon web-based tasks, AI agents must be able to sequentially follow real-world user instructions over a long period. Unlike existing web-based agent benchmarks, sequential instruction following in the real world poses significant challenges beyond performing a single, clearly defined task. For instance, real-world human instructions can be ambiguous, require different levels of AI assistance, and may evolve over time, reflecting changes in the user's mental state. To address this gap, we introduce RealWebAssist, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate sequential instruction-following in realistic scenarios involving long-horizon interactions with the web, visual GUI grounding, and understanding ambiguous real-world user instructions. RealWebAssist includes a dataset of sequential instructions collected from real-world human users. Each user instructs a web-based assistant to perform a series of tasks on multiple websites. A successful agent must reason about the true intent behind each instruction, keep track of the mental state of the user, understand user-specific routines, and ground the intended tasks to actions on the correct GUI elements. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art models struggle to understand and ground user instructions, posing critical challenges in following real-world user instructions for long-horizon web assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktor Dorfler, Dylan Dryden, Viet Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a Platform created in order to support SMEs' endeavor to extract value from their intangible assets effectively. To implement the Platform, we developed five knowledge bases using a knowledge-based ex-pert system shell that contain knowledge from intangible as-set consultants, patent attorneys and due diligence lawyers. In order to operationalize the knowledge bases, we developed a "Rosetta Stone", an interpreter unit for the knowledge bases outside the shell and embedded in the plat-form. Building on the initial knowledge bases we have created a system of red flags, risk scoring, and valuation with the involvement of the same experts; these additional systems work upon the initial knowledge bases and therefore they can be regarded as meta-knowledge-representations that take the form of second-order knowledge graphs. All this clever technology is dressed up in an easy-to-handle graphical user interface that we will showcase at the conference. The initial platform was finished mid-2024; therefore, it qualifies as an "emerging application of AI" and "deployable AI", while development continues. The two firms that provided experts for developing the knowledge bases obtained a white-label version of the product (i.e. it runs under their own brand "powered by Intanify"), and there are two completed cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soo Yong Lee, Hyunjin Hwang, Taekwan Kim, Yuyeong Kim, Kyuri Park, Jaemin Yoo, Denny Borsboom, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) implement computations of psychopathology? An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, mechanisms underlying LLM behaviors need to be studied for better methodological validity. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. To ground the theory for empirical analysis, we also propose a novel mechanistic interpretability method alongside a tailored empirical analytic framework. Based on the frameworks, we conduct experiments demonstrating three key claims: first, that distinct dysfunctional and problematic representational states are implemented in LLMs; second, that their activations can spread and self-sustain to trap LLMs; and third, that dynamic, cyclic structural causal models encoded in the LLMs underpin these patterns. In concert, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing. Thus, our work alludes to the possibility of AI systems with psychopathological behaviors in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Sukiennik, Haoyu Wang, Zailin Zeng, Chen Gao, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: An increasing reliance on recommender systems has led to concerns about the creation of filter bubbles on social media, especially on short video platforms like TikTok. However, their formation is still not entirely understood due to the complex dynamics between recommendation algorithms and user feedback. In this paper, we aim to shed light on these dynamics using a large language model-based simulation framework. Our work employs real-world short-video data containing rich video content information and detailed user-agents to realistically simulate the recommendation-feedback cycle. Through large-scale simulations, we demonstrate that LLMs can replicate real-world user-recommender interactions, uncovering key mechanisms driving filter bubble formation. We identify critical factors, such as demographic features and category attraction that exacerbate content homogenization. To mitigate this, we design and test interventions including various cold-start and feedback weighting strategies, showing measurable reductions in filter bubble effects. Our framework enables rapid prototyping of recommendation strategies, offering actionable solutions to enhance content diversity in real-world systems. Furthermore, we analyze how LLM-inherent biases may propagate through recommendations, proposing safeguards to promote equity for vulnerable groups, such as women and low-income populations. By examining the interplay between recommendation and LLM agents, this work advances a deeper understanding of algorithmic bias and provides practical tools to promote inclusive digital spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esmail Gumaan</p>
<p>Abstract: ExpertRAG is a novel theoretical framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to advance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-intensive language modeling. We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Yazan, Suzan Verberne, Frederik Situmeang</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalization with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often fails to capture fine-grained features of authors, making it hard to identify their unique traits. To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p>

By transforming structured data into natural language representations, we generate high-dimensional embeddings that capture deeper semantic relationships between users, items, and contexts. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves recommendation accuracy and relevance, resulting in more personalized and context-aware recommendations.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating multimodal data (text, images, videos) into retrieval and generation processes, overcoming the limitations of text-only Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG improves response accuracy by incorporating external textual knowledge, MRAG extends this framework to include multimodal retrieval and generation, leveraging contextual information from diverse data types. This approach reduces hallucinations and enhances question-answering systems by grounding responses in factual, multimodal knowledge. Recent studies show MRAG outperforms traditional RAG, especially in scenarios requiring both visual and textual understanding. This survey reviews MRAG's essential components, datasets, evaluation methods, and limitations, providing insights into its construction and improvement. It also identifies challenges and future research directions, highlighting MRAG's potential to revolutionize multimodal information retrieval and generation. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this work encourages further exploration into this promising paradigm.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of short video platforms, recommendation systems have become key technologies for improving user experience and enhancing platform engagement. However, while short video recommendation systems leverage multimodal information (such as images, text, and audio) to improve recommendation effectiveness, they also face the severe challenge of user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a short video recommendation system based on multimodal information and differential privacy protection. First, deep learning models are used for feature extraction and fusion of multimodal data, effectively improving recommendation accuracy. Then, a differential privacy protection mechanism suitable for recommendation scenarios is designed to ensure user data privacy while maintaining system performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in terms of recommendation accuracy, multimodal fusion effectiveness, and privacy protection performance, providing important insights for the design of recommendation systems for short video platforms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown in their usage to provide support for question answering across numerous disciplines. The models on their own have already shown promise for answering basic questions, however fail quickly where expert domain knowledge is required or the question is nuanced. Scientific research often involves searching for relevant literature, distilling pertinent information from that literature and analysing how the findings support or contradict one another. The information is often encapsulated in the full text body of research articles, rather than just in the abstracts. Statements within these articles frequently require the wider article context to be fully understood. We have built an LLM-based system that performs such search and distillation of information encapsulated in scientific literature, and we evaluate our keyword based search and information distillation system against a set of biology related questions from previously released literature benchmarks. We demonstrate sparse retrieval methods exhibit results close to state of the art without the need for dense retrieval, with its associated infrastructure and complexity overhead. We also show how to increase the coverage of relevant documents for literature review generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To bridge this gap, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSales), a novel task that unifies preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion to better support user decision-making. For a realistic evaluation of CSales, we present CSUser, an LLM-based user simulator constructed from real-world data, modeling diverse user profiles with needs and personalities. Additionally, we propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual profiles through dialogue for personalized action planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSUser effectively replicates real-world users and emphasize the importance of contextual profiling for strategic action selection, ultimately driving successful purchases in e-commerce.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computer Science and Design practitioners have been researching and proposing alternatives for a dearth of recommendations, standards, or best practices in user interfaces for decades. Now, with the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), we have yet again an emerging, powerful technology that lacks sufficient guidance in terms of possible interactions, inputs, and outcomes. In this context, this work proposes a lightweight framework for responsible prompting recommendation to be added before the prompt is sent to GenAI. The framework is comprised of (1) a human-curated dataset for recommendations, (2) a red team dataset for assessing recommendations, (3) a sentence transformer for semantics mapping, (4) a similarity metric to map input prompt to recommendations, (5) a set of similarity thresholds, (6) quantized sentence embeddings, (7) a recommendation engine, and (8) an evaluation step to use the red team dataset. With the proposed framework and open-source system, the contributions presented can be applied in multiple contexts where end-users can benefit from guidance for interacting with GenAI in a more responsible way, recommending positive values to be added and harmful sentences to be removed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed various sectors, including education, finance, and medicine, by enhancing content generation and decision-making processes. However, their integration into the medical field is cautious due to hallucinations, instances where generated content deviates from factual accuracy, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. To address this, we introduce Hyper-RAG, a hypergraph-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation method that comprehensively captures both pairwise and beyond-pairwise correlations in domain-specific knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experiments on the NeurologyCrop dataset with six prominent LLMs demonstrated that Hyper-RAG improves accuracy by an average of 12.3% over direct LLM use and outperforms Graph RAG and Light RAG by 6.3% and 6.0%, respectively. Additionally, Hyper-RAG maintained stable performance with increasing query complexity, unlike existing methods which declined. Further validation across nine diverse datasets showed a 35.5% performance improvement over Light RAG using a selection-based assessment. The lightweight variant, Hyper-RAG-Lite, achieved twice the retrieval speed and a 3.3% performance boost compared with Light RAG. These results confirm Hyper-RAG's effectiveness in enhancing LLM reliability and reducing hallucinations, making it a robust solution for high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wen, Jiannong Cao, Zian Wang, Beichen Guo, Ruosong Yang, Shuaiqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of academic literature creates urgent demands for comprehensive survey papers, yet manual writing remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) facilitate studies in synthesizing survey papers from multiple references, but most existing works restrict users to title-only inputs and fixed outputs, neglecting the personalized process of survey paper writing. In this paper, we introduce InteractiveSurvey - an LLM-based personalized and interactive survey paper generation system. InteractiveSurvey can generate structured, multi-modal survey papers with reference categorizations from multiple reference papers through both online retrieval and user uploads. More importantly, users can customize and refine intermediate components continuously during generation, including reference categorization, outline, and survey content through an intuitive interface. Evaluations of content quality, time efficiency, and user studies show that InteractiveSurvey is an easy-to-use survey generation system that outperforms most LLMs and existing methods in output content quality while remaining highly time-efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dario Izzo, Sebastien Origer, Giacomo Acciarini, Francesco Biscani</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks, widely recognised for their role in machine learning, are now transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modelling with classical dynamical systems and enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, the practical applicability of these models remains constrained by the opacity of their learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of these dynamical systems are predominantly restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce Event Transition Tensors, a framework based on high-order differentials that provides a rigorous mathematical description of neural ODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterising uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analysing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method enhances the interpretability and rigour of neural ODEs by expressing their behaviour through explicit mathematical structures. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new model to generate the browsing process for short-video recommendation and proposes a novel Segment Content Aware Model via User Engagement Feedback (SCAM) for watch time prediction in video recommendation. Unlike existing methods that rely on multimodal features for video content understanding, SCAM implicitly models video content through users' historical watching behavior, enabling segment-level understanding without complex multimodal data. By dividing videos into segments based on duration and employing a Transformer-like architecture, SCAM captures the sequential dependence between segments while mitigating duration bias. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale and public datasets demonstrate SCAM's state-of-the-art performance in watch time prediction. The proposed approach offers a scalable and effective solution for video recommendation by leveraging segment-level modeling and users' engagement feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younghwan Lee, Tung M. Luu, Donghoon Lee, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), learning from fixed datasets presents a promising solution for domains where real-time interaction with the environment is expensive or risky. However, designing dense reward signals for offline dataset requires significant human effort and domain expertise. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an alternative, but it remains costly due to the human-in-the-loop process, prompting interest in automated reward generation models. To address this, we propose Reward Generation via Large Vision-Language Models (RG-VLM), which leverages the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs to generate rewards from offline data without human involvement. RG-VLM improves generalization in long-horizon tasks and can be seamlessly integrated with the sparse reward signals to enhance task performance, demonstrating its potential as an auxiliary reward signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Wolfram, Aaron Schein</p>
<p>Abstract: How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Xiong, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability to comprehend and encode conceptual knowledge, revealing a lattice structure among concepts. This raises a critical question: how does this conceptualization emerge from MLM pretraining? In this paper, we explore this problem from the perspective of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a mathematical framework that derives concept lattices from the observations of object-attribute relationships. We show that the MLM's objective implicitly learns a \emph{formal context} that describes objects, attributes, and their dependencies, which enables the reconstruction of a concept lattice through FCA. We propose a novel framework for concept lattice construction from pretrained MLMs and investigate the origin of the inductive biases of MLMs in lattice structure learning. Our framework differs from previous work because it does not rely on human-defined concepts and allows for discovering "latent" concepts that extend beyond human definitions. We create three datasets for evaluation, and the empirical results verify our hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxin Xiong, Yanyu Wang, Suat Gunhan, Yimin Zhu, Charles Berryman</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing complexity of construction management (CM) projects, coupled with challenges such as strict regulatory requirements and labor shortages, requires specialized analytical tools that streamline project workflow and enhance performance. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in general reasoning tasks, their effectiveness in tackling CM-specific challenges, such as precise quantitative analysis and regulatory interpretation, remains inadequately explored. To bridge this gap, this study introduces CMExamSet, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset comprising 689 authentic multiple-choice questions sourced from four nationally accredited CM certification exams. Our zero-shot evaluation assesses overall accuracy, subject areas (e.g., construction safety), reasoning complexity (single-step and multi-step), and question formats (text-only, figure-referenced, and table-referenced). The results indicate that GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 surpass typical human pass thresholds (70%), with average accuracies of 82% and 83%, respectively. Additionally, both models performed better on single-step tasks, with accuracies of 85.7% (GPT-4o) and 86.7% (Claude 3.7). Multi-step tasks were more challenging, reducing performance to 76.5% and 77.6%, respectively. Furthermore, both LLMs show significant limitations on figure-referenced questions, with accuracies dropping to approximately 40%. Our error pattern analysis further reveals that conceptual misunderstandings are the most common (44.4% and 47.9%), underscoring the need for enhanced domain-specific reasoning models. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as valuable supplementary analytical tools in CM, while highlighting the need for domain-specific refinements and sustained human oversight in complex decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu-Xiang Zhong, Chao Yi, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous benchmarks have been proposed to measure and compare the capabilities of different LLMs. However, evaluating LLMs is costly due to the large number of test instances and their slow inference speed. In this paper, we aim to explore how to efficiently estimate a model's real performance on a given benchmark based on its evaluation results on a small number of instances sampled from the benchmark. Inspired by Collaborative Filtering (CF) in Recommendation Systems (RS), we treat LLMs as users and test instances as items and propose a two-stage method. In the first stage, we treat instance selection as recommending products to users to choose instances that can easily distinguish model performance. In the second stage, we see performance prediction as rating prediction problem in RS to predict the target LLM's behavior on unselected instances. Experiments on multiple LLMs and datasets imply that our method can accurately estimate the target model's performance while largely reducing its inference overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Beerens, Desmond J. Higham</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new attack paradigm that embeds hidden adversarial capabilities directly into diffusion models via fine-tuning, without altering their observable behavior or requiring modifications during inference. Unlike prior approaches that target specific images or adjust the generation process to produce adversarial outputs, our method integrates adversarial functionality into the model itself. The resulting tampered model generates high-quality images indistinguishable from those of the original, yet these images cause misclassification in downstream classifiers at a high rate. The misclassification can be targeted to specific output classes. Users can employ this compromised model unaware of its embedded adversarial nature, as it functions identically to a standard diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our approach, uncovering a covert attack vector that raises new security concerns. These findings expose a risk arising from the use of externally-supplied models and highlight the urgent need for robust model verification and defense mechanisms against hidden threats in generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated considerable interest in their utilization for sequential recommendation tasks. While collaborative signals from similar users are central to recommendation modeling, effectively transforming these signals into a format that LLMs can understand and utilize remains challenging. The critical challenges include selecting relevant demonstrations from large-scale user interactions and ensuring their alignment with LLMs' reasoning process. To address these challenges, we introduce AdaptRec, a self-adaptive fram-ework that leverages LLMs for sequential recommendations by incorporating explicit collaborative signals. AdaptRec employs a two-phase user selection mechanism -- User Similarity Retrieval and Self-Adaptive User Selection -- to efficiently identify relevant user sequences in large-scale datasets from multi-metric evaluation. We also develop a User-Based Similarity Retrieval Prompt, enabling the model to actively select similar users and continuously refine its selection criteria during training. Using the collaborative signals from similar users, we construct a User-Contextualized Recommendation Prompt that translates their behavior sequences into natural language, explicitly integrating this information into the recommendation process. Experiments demonstrate AdaptRec's superior performance, with significant improvements in HitRatio@1 scores of 7.13\%, 18.16\%, and 10.41\% across real-world datasets with full fine-tuning, and even higher gains of 23.00\%, 15.97\%, and 17.98\% in few-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghang Li, Tao Li, Wenjiao Feng, Mohsen Guizani, Hongfang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency of DeepSeek R1 and QwQ 32B have broken through performance barriers for running frontier large language models (LLMs) on home devices. While consumer hardware is getting stronger and model quantization is improving, existing end-side solutions still demand GPU clusters, large RAM/VRAM, and high bandwidth, far beyond what a common home cluster can handle. This paper introduces prima.cpp, a distributed inference system that runs 70B-scale models on everyday home devices using a mix of CPU/GPU, low RAM/VRAM, Wi-Fi, and cross-platform support. It uses mmap to manage model weights and introduces piped-ring parallelism with prefetching to hide disk loading. By modeling heterogeneity in computation, communication, disk, memory (and its management behavior), and OS, it optimally assigns model layers to each device's CPU and GPU, further reducing token latency. An elegant algorithm named Halda is proposed to solve this NP-hard assignment problem. We evaluate prima.cpp on a common four-node home cluster. It outperforms llama.cpp, exo, and dllama on 30B+ models while keeping memory pressure below 6%. This brings frontier 30B-70B models, such as Llama 3, DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, and QwQ to home assistants, making advanced AI truly accessible to individuals.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge A. Huertas, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs are grouped in batches and processed sequentially within their batch. This paper considers multiple parallel machines, nonidentical job weights and release times, and sequence-dependent setup times between batches of different families. Although s-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken into account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as semiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this minimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming and meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP) to do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, for the first time, a CP model for s-batching with minimum batch size. The computational experiments on standard cases compare the CP model with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. The results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed CP model to handle multiple variations of s-batching; and its ability to produce, in large instances, better solutions than the MIP models faster.</p>

<p>Abstract: Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of natural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas pre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data. These findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting textual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes between normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive detection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces significant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a significant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection but consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD (GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip non-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption without compromising detection performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) -- enhanced versions of multimodal language models (MLLMs) equipped with reasoning capabilities -- has revolutionized diverse applications. However, their safety implications remain underexplored. While prior work has exposed critical vulnerabilities in unimodal reasoning models, MLRMs introduce distinct risks from cross-modal reasoning pathways. This work presents the first systematic safety analysis of MLRMs through large-scale empirical studies comparing MLRMs with their base MLLMs. Our experiments reveal three critical findings: (1) The Reasoning Tax: Acquiring reasoning capabilities catastrophically degrades inherited safety alignment. MLRMs exhibit 37.44% higher jailbreaking success rates than base MLLMs under adversarial attacks. (2) Safety Blind Spots: While safety degradation is pervasive, certain scenarios (e.g., Illegal Activity) suffer 25 times higher attack rates -- far exceeding the average 3.4 times increase, revealing scenario-specific vulnerabilities with alarming cross-model and datasets consistency. (3) Emergent Self-Correction: Despite tight reasoning-answer safety coupling, MLRMs demonstrate nascent self-correction -- 16.9% of jailbroken reasoning steps are overridden by safe answers, hinting at intrinsic safeguards. These findings underscore the urgency of scenario-aware safety auditing and mechanisms to amplify MLRMs' self-correction potential. To catalyze research, we open-source OpenSafeMLRM, the first toolkit for MLRM safety evaluation, providing unified interface for mainstream models, datasets, and jailbreaking methods. Our work calls for immediate efforts to harden reasoning-augmented AI, ensuring its transformative potential aligns with ethical safeguards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as the backbone for time series prediction has recently gained significant research interest. However, the effectiveness of LLM backbones in this domain remains a topic of debate. Based on thorough empirical analyses, we observe that training and testing LLM-based models on small datasets often leads to the Encoder and Decoder becoming overly adapted to the dataset, thereby obscuring the true predictive capabilities of the LLM backbone. To investigate the genuine potential of LLMs in time series prediction, we introduce three pre-training models with identical architectures but different pre-training strategies. Thereby, large-scale pre-training allows us to create unbiased Encoder and Decoder components tailored to the LLM backbone. Through controlled experiments, we evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot prediction performance of the LLM, offering insights into its capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that although the LLM backbone demonstrates some promise, its forecasting performance is limited.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobing Yu, Jin Yang, Xiao Wu, Peijie Qiu, Xiaofeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: How to adapt a pre-trained model continuously for sequential tasks with different prediction class labels and domains and finally learn a generalizable model across diverse tasks is a long-lasting challenge. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models (e.g., Transformers) for sequential tasks. While many existing CL methods incrementally store additional learned structures, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters or prompts and sometimes even preserve features from previous samples to maintain performance. This leads to unsustainable parameter growth and escalating storage costs as the number of tasks increases. Moreover, current approaches often lack task similarity awareness, which further hinders the models ability to effectively adapt to new tasks without interfering with previously acquired knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose FM-LoRA, a novel and efficient low-rank adaptation method that integrates both a dynamic rank selector (DRS) and dynamic meta-prompting (DMP). This framework allocates model capacity more effectively across tasks by leveraging a shared low-rank subspace critical for preserving knowledge, thereby avoiding continual parameter expansion. Extensive experiments on various CL benchmarks, including ImageNet-R, CIFAR100, and CUB200 for class-incremental learning (CIL), and DomainNet for domain-incremental learning (DIL), with Transformers backbone demonstrate that FM-LoRA effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while delivering robust performance across a diverse range of tasks and domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the third most prevalent malignant tumour worldwide. Early detection of CRC remains problematic due to its non-specific and often embarrassing symptoms, which patients frequently overlook or hesitate to report to clinicians. Crucially, the stage at which CRC is diagnosed significantly impacts survivability, with a survival rate of 80-95\% for Stage I and a stark decline to 10\% for Stage IV. Unfortunately, in the UK, only 14.4\% of cases are diagnosed at the earliest stage (Stage I).
  In this study, we propose ColonScopeX, a machine learning framework utilizing explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to enhance the early detection of CRC and pre-cancerous lesions. Our approach employs a multimodal model that integrates signals from blood sample measurements, processed using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm for fingerprint smoothing, alongside comprehensive patient metadata, including medication history, comorbidities, age, weight, and BMI. By leveraging XAI techniques, we aim to render the model's decision-making process transparent and interpretable, thereby fostering greater trust and understanding in its predictions. The proposed framework could be utilised as a triage tool or a screening tool of the general population.
  This research highlights the potential of combining diverse patient data sources and explainable machine learning to tackle critical challenges in medical diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samy-Melwan Vilhes (LITIS), Gilles Gasso (LITIS), Mokhtar Z Alaya (LMAC)</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) focuses on identifying whether observations in streaming data deviate significantly from normal patterns. With the prevalence of connected devices, anomaly detection on time series has become paramount, as it enables real-time monitoring and early detection of irregular behaviors across various application domains. In this work, we introduce PatchTrAD, a Patch-based Transformer model for time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show that PatchTrAD is on par, in terms of detection performance, with state-of-the-art deep learning models for anomaly detection while being time efficient during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G. Charbel N. Kindji (IRISA, MALT), Elisa Fromont (MALT, IRISA), Lina Maria Rojas-Barahona, Tanguy Urvoy</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing power of generative models raises major concerns about the authenticity of published content. To address this problem, several synthetic content detection methods have been proposed for uniformly structured media such as image or text. However, little work has been done on the detection of synthetic tabular data, despite its importance in industry and government. This form of data is complex to handle due to the diversity of its structures: the number and types of the columns may vary wildly from one table to another. We tackle the tough problem of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'', i.e. when the model is deployed on table structures it has never seen before. We introduce a novel datum-wise transformer architecture and show that it outperforms existing models. Furthermore, we investigate the application of domain adaptation techniques to enhance the effectiveness of our model, thereby providing a more robust data-forgery detection solution.</p>

This article focuses on informing students about the significance of investing their time during their studies on developing essential life-long learning skills using their own critical thinking, rather than depending on AI models that are susceptible to misinformation, hallucination, and bias. As we transition to an AI-centric era, it is important to educate students on how these models work, their pitfalls, and the ethical concerns associated with feeding data to such tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Wang, Chao Qu, Zuming Huang, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a textual rethinking trigger to the end of initial rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision to achieve 80.3%, 61.8%, and 43.9% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with GPT-o1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Lasby, Nish Sinnadurai, Valavan Manohararajah, Sean Lie, Vithursan Thangarasa</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for reducing the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a fault-tolerant framework that enables the use of highly compressed draft models. In this work, we introduce Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters (SD$^2$), a novel methodology that leverages self-data distillation and fine-grained weight sparsity to produce highly efficient and well-aligned draft models. SD$^2$ systematically enhances draft token acceptance rates while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs), even in the Universal Assisted Generation (UAG) setting, where draft and target models originate from different model families. On a Llama-3.1-70B target model, SD$^2$ provides a $\times$1.59 higher Mean Accepted Length (MAL) compared to layer-pruned draft models and reduces MACs by over 43.87% with a 8.36% reduction in MAL compared to a dense draft models. Our results highlight the potential of sparsity-aware fine-tuning and compression strategies to improve LLM inference efficiency while maintaining alignment with target models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasiliki Tassopoulou, Haochang Shou, Christos Davatzikos</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal biomedical studies monitor individuals over time to capture dynamics in brain development, disease progression, and treatment effects. However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two common modalities for providing RT treatment planning and delivery guidance/monitoring. In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful and widely adopted technique across various fields, valued for its efficiency and convenience enabled by implicit function definition and data-driven feature representation learning. Here, we present a series of AI-driven medical imaging reconstruction frameworks for enhanced radiotherapy, designed to improve CT image reconstruction quality and speed, refine dual-energy CT (DECT) multi-material decomposition (MMD), and significantly accelerate 4D MRI acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mostafa Faghih Shojaei, Rahul Gulati, Benjamin A. Jasperson, Shangshang Wang, Simone Cimolato, Dangli Cao, Willie Neiswanger, Krishna Garikipati</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AI University (AI-U), a flexible framework for AI-driven course content delivery that adapts to instructors' teaching styles. At its core, AI-U fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate instructor-aligned responses from lecture videos, notes, and textbooks. Using a graduate-level finite-element-method (FEM) course as a case study, we present a scalable pipeline to systematically construct training data, fine-tune an open-source LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and optimize its responses through RAG-based synthesis. Our evaluation - combining cosine similarity, LLM-based assessment, and expert review - demonstrates strong alignment with course materials. We also have developed a prototype web application, available at https://my-ai-university.com, that enhances traceability by linking AI-generated responses to specific sections of the relevant course material and time-stamped instances of the open-access video lectures. Our expert model is found to have greater cosine similarity with a reference on 86% of test cases. An LLM judge also found our expert model to outperform the base Llama 3.2 model approximately four times out of five. AI-U offers a scalable approach to AI-assisted education, paving the way for broader adoption in higher education. Here, our framework has been presented in the setting of a class on FEM - a subject that is central to training PhD and Master students in engineering science. However, this setting is a particular instance of a broader context: fine-tuning LLMs to research content in science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bibek Upadhayay, Vahid Behzadan, Ph. D</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to numerous applications in critical domains where reliability is paramount. Despite significant advances in safety frameworks and guardrails, current protective measures exhibit crucial vulnerabilities, particularly in multilingual contexts. Existing safety systems remain susceptible to adversarial attacks in low-resource languages and through code-switching techniques, primarily due to their English-centric design. Furthermore, the development of effective multilingual guardrails is constrained by the scarcity of diverse cross-lingual training data. Even recent solutions like Llama Guard-3, while offering multilingual support, lack transparency in their decision-making processes. We address these challenges by introducing X-Guard agent, a transparent multilingual safety agent designed to provide content moderation across diverse linguistic contexts. X-Guard effectively defends against both conventional low-resource language attacks and sophisticated code-switching attacks. Our approach includes: curating and enhancing multiple open-source safety datasets with explicit evaluation rationales; employing a jury of judges methodology to mitigate individual judge LLM provider biases; creating a comprehensive multilingual safety dataset spanning 132 languages with 5 million data points; and developing a two-stage architecture combining a custom-finetuned mBART-50 translation module with an evaluation X-Guard 3B model trained through supervised finetuning and GRPO training. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate X-Guard's effectiveness in detecting unsafe content across multiple languages while maintaining transparency throughout the safety evaluation process. Our work represents a significant advancement in creating robust, transparent, and linguistically inclusive safety systems for LLMs and its integrated systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mallika Mainali, Rosina O. Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive attributes are fundamental to metacognition, shaping how individuals process information, evaluate choices, and make decisions. To develop metacognitive artificial intelligence (AI) models that reflect human reasoning, it is essential to account for the attributes that influence reasoning patterns and decision-maker behavior, often leading to different or even conflicting choices. This makes it crucial to incorporate cognitive attributes in designing AI models that align with human decision-making processes, especially in high-stakes domains such as finance, where decisions have significant real-world consequences. However, existing AI alignment research has primarily focused on value alignment, often overlooking the role of individual cognitive attributes that distinguish decision-makers. To address this issue, this paper (1) analyzes the literature on cognitive attributes, (2) establishes five criteria for defining them, and (3) categorizes 19 domain-specific cognitive attributes relevant to financial decision-making. These three components provide a strong basis for developing AI systems that accurately reflect and align with human decision-making processes in financial contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early exiting has recently emerged as a promising technique for accelerating large language models (LLMs) by effectively reducing the hardware computation and memory access. In this paper, we present SpecEE, a fast LLM inference engine with speculative early exiting. (1) At the algorithm level, we propose the speculation-based lightweight predictor design by exploiting the probabilistic correlation between the speculative tokens and the correct results and high parallelism of GPUs. (2) At the system level, we point out that not all layers need a predictor and design the two-level heuristic predictor scheduling engine based on skewed distribution and contextual similarity. (3) At the mapping level, we point out that different decoding methods share the same essential characteristics, and propose the context-aware merged mapping for predictor with efficient GPU implementations to support speculative decoding, and form a framework for various existing orthogonal acceleration techniques (e.g., quantization and sparse activation) on cloud and personal computer (PC) scenarios, successfully pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and speedup. It is worth noting that SpecEE can be applied to any LLM by negligible training overhead in advance without affecting the model original parameters. Extensive experiments show that SpecEE achieves 2.25x and 2.43x speedup with Llama2-7B on cloud and PC scenarios respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchu Jiang, Jiale Fu, Chenduo Hao, Xinting Hu, Yingzhe Peng, Xin Geng, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, In-context Learning (ICL) has become a significant inference paradigm in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), utilizing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs) to prompt LMMs for new tasks. However, the synergistic effects in multimodal data increase the sensitivity of ICL performance to the configurations of ICDs, stimulating the need for a more stable and general mapping function. Mathematically, in Transformer-based models, ICDs act as ``shift vectors'' added to the hidden states of query tokens. Inspired by this, we introduce Mimic In-Context Learning (MimIC) to learn stable and generalizable shift effects from ICDs. Specifically, compared with some previous shift vector-based methods, MimIC more strictly approximates the shift effects by integrating lightweight learnable modules into LMMs with four key enhancements: 1) inserting shift vectors after attention layers, 2) assigning a shift vector to each attention head, 3) making shift magnitude query-dependent, and 4) employing a layer-wise alignment loss. Extensive experiments on two LMMs (Idefics-9b and Idefics2-8b-base) across three multimodal tasks (VQAv2, OK-VQA, Captioning) demonstrate that MimIC outperforms existing shift vector-based methods.

<p>Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of machine learning (ML) models have driven the growing need for custom hardware accelerators capable of efficiently supporting ML workloads. However, the design of such accelerators remains a time-consuming process, heavily relying on engineers to manually ensure design interpretability through clear documentation and effective communication. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising opportunity to automate these design interpretability tasks, particularly the generation of natural language descriptions for register-transfer level (RTL) code, what we refer to as "RTL-to-NL tasks." In this paper, we examine how design interpretability, particularly in RTL-to-NL tasks, influences the efficiency of the hardware design process. We review existing work adapting LLMs for these tasks, highlight key challenges that remain unaddressed, including those related to data, computation, and model development, and identify opportunities to address them. By doing so, we aim to guide future research in leveraging ML to automate RTL-to-NL tasks and improve hardware design interpretability, thereby accelerating the hardware design process and meeting the increasing demand for custom hardware accelerators in machine learning and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Formosa, In\^es Hip\'olito, Thomas Montefiore</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems exhibiting complex and seemingly agentive behaviours necessitates a critical philosophical examination of their agency, autonomy, and moral status. In this paper we undertake a systematic analysis of the differences between basic, autonomous, and moral agency in artificial systems. We argue that while current AI systems are highly sophisticated, they lack genuine agency and autonomy because: they operate within rigid boundaries of pre-programmed objectives rather than exhibiting true goal-directed behaviour within their environment; they cannot authentically shape their engagement with the world; and they lack the critical self-reflection and autonomy competencies required for full autonomy. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of future systems that could achieve a limited form of artificial moral agency without consciousness through hybrid approaches to ethical decision-making. This leads us to suggest, by appealing to the necessity of consciousness for moral patiency, that such non-conscious AMAs might represent a case that challenges traditional assumptions about the necessary connection between moral agency and moral patiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are transforming the global labor market. Human workers, limited to a 33% duty cycle due to rest and holidays, cost $14 to $55 per hour. In contrast, digital labor operates nearly 24/7 at just $0.10 to $0.50 per hour. We examine sectors like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and retail, finding that 40-70% of tasks could be automated. Yet, human skills like emotional intelligence and adaptability remain essential. Humans process 5,000-20,000 tokens (units of information) per hour, while AI far exceeds this, though its energy use-3.5 to 7 times higher than humans-could offset 20-40% of cost savings. Using real-world examples, such as AI in journalism and law, we illustrate these dynamics and propose six strategies-like a 4-day workweek and retraining-to ensure a fair transition to an AI-driven economy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting key concepts and their relationships from course information and materials facilitates the provision of visualizations and recommendations for learners who need to select the right courses to take from a large number of courses. However, identifying and extracting themes manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Previous machine learning-based methods to extract relevant concepts from courses heavily rely on detailed course materials, which necessitates labor-intensive preparation of course materials. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs such as GPT in automatically generating course concepts and their relations. Specifically, we design a suite of prompts and provide GPT with the course information with different levels of detail, thereby generating high-quality course concepts and identifying their relations. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate the quality of the generated concepts and relationships through extensive experiments. Our results demonstrate the viability of LLMs as a tool for supporting educational content selection and delivery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Polymer conformation generation is a critical task that enables atomic-level studies of diverse polymer materials. While significant advances have been made in designing various conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to polymers' unique structural characteristics. The scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits progress, making this promising area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities for this task. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model. We then generate corresponding orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble these local conformations into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently generates high-quality polymer conformations, facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Yan, Boyu Diao, Hangda Liu, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation with a wide range of applications in scientific computing and artificial intelligence. However, the large scale and sparsity of sparse matrix often make it a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we highlight the effectiveness of hash-based techniques in optimizing sparse matrix reordering, introducing the Hash-based Partition (HBP) format, a lightweight SpMV approach. HBP retains the performance benefits of the 2D-partitioning method while leveraging the hash transformation's ability to group similar elements, thereby accelerating the pre-processing phase of sparse matrix reordering. Additionally, we achieve parallel load balancing across matrix blocks through a competitive method. Our experiments, conducted on both Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin and Nvidia RTX 4090, show that in the pre-processing step, our method offers an average speedup of 3.53 times compared to the sorting approach and 3.67 times compared to the dynamic programming method employed in Regu2D. Furthermore, in SpMV, our method achieves a maximum speedup of 3.32 times on Orin and 3.01 times on RTX4090 against the CSR format in sparse matrices from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objectives: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to facilitate "continual learning" in medicine, in which an ML system continues to evolve in response to exposure to new data over time, even after being deployed in a clinical setting. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on the range of ethical issues raised by the use of such "adaptive" ML systems in medicine that have, thus far, been neglected in the literature.
  Target audience: The target audiences for this tutorial are the developers of machine learning AI systems, healthcare regulators, the broader medical informatics community, and practicing clinicians.
  Scope: Discussions of adaptive ML systems to date have overlooked the distinction between two sorts of variance that such systems may exhibit -- diachronic evolution (change over time) and synchronic variation (difference between cotemporaneous instantiations of the algorithm at different sites) -- and under-estimated the significance of the latter. We highlight the challenges that diachronic evolution and synchronic variation present for the quality of patient care, informed consent, and equity, and discuss the complex ethical trade-offs involved in the design of such systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyang Wu, Nan Guo, Junliang Lv, Xiao Xiao, Xiaochun Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: As an essential part of modern hardware design, manually writing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code such as Verilog is often labor-intensive. Following the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun to explore utilizing LLMs for generating RTL code. However, current studies primarily focus on generating simple single modules, which can not meet the demands in real world. In fact, due to challenges in managing long-context RTL code and complex cross-file dependencies, existing solutions cannot handle large-scale Verilog repositories in practical hardware development. As the first endeavor to exclusively adapt LLMs for large-scale RTL development, we propose RTLRepoCoder, a groundbreaking solution that incorporates specific fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for repository-level Verilog code completion. Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world, along with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning. The optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context by retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are carried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting strategy, and the chunk size. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmark, significantly surpassing GPT-4 and advanced domain-specific LLMs on Edit Similarity and Exact Match rate. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach and offer insights for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Sukiennik, Chen Gao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs as intelligent agents are being increasingly applied in scenarios where human interactions are involved, leading to a critical concern about whether LLMs are faithful to the variations in culture across regions. Several works have investigated this question in various ways, finding that there are biases present in the cultural representations of LLM outputs. To gain a more comprehensive view, in this work, we conduct the first large-scale evaluation of LLM culture assessing 20 countries' cultures and languages across ten LLMs. With a renowned cultural values questionnaire and by carefully analyzing LLM output with human ground truth scores, we thoroughly study LLMs' cultural alignment across countries and among individual models. Our findings show that the output over all models represents a moderate cultural middle ground. Given the overall skew, we propose an alignment metric, revealing that the United States is the best-aligned country and GLM-4 has the best ability to align to cultural values. Deeper investigation sheds light on the influence of model origin, prompt language, and value dimensions on cultural output. Specifically, models, regardless of where they originate, align better with the US than they do with China. The conclusions provide insight to how LLMs can be better aligned to various cultures as well as provoke further discussion of the potential for LLMs to propagate cultural bias and the need for more culturally adaptable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad A. A. K. Jalwana, Naveed Akhtar, Ajmal Mian, Nazanin Rahnavard, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, deep visual models are susceptible to transferable black-box adversarial attacks. Principally, these attacks craft perturbations in a target model-agnostic manner. However, surprisingly, we find that existing methods in this domain inadvertently take help from various priors that violate the black-box assumption such as the availability of the dataset used to train the target model, and the knowledge of the number of classes in the target model. Consequently, the literature fails to articulate the true potency of transferable black-box attacks. We provide an empirical study of these biases and propose a framework that aids in a prior-free transparent study of this paradigm. Using our framework, we analyze the role of prior knowledge of the target model data and number of classes in attack performance. We also provide several interesting insights based on our analysis, and demonstrate that priors cause overestimation in transferability scores. Finally, we extend our framework to query-based attacks. This extension inspires a novel image-blending technique to prepare data for effective surrogate model training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed communication, yet their role in secure messaging remains underexplored, especially in surveillance-heavy environments. At the same time, many governments all over the world are proposing legislation to detect, backdoor, or even ban encrypted communication. That emphasizes the need for alternative ways to communicate securely and covertly over open channels. We propose a novel cryptographic embedding framework that enables covert Public Key or Symmetric Key encrypted communication over public chat channels with humanlike produced texts. Some unique properties of our framework are: 1. It is LLM agnostic, i.e., it allows participants to use different local LLM models independently; 2. It is pre- or post-quantum agnostic; 3. It ensures indistinguishability from human-like chat-produced texts. Thus, it offers a viable alternative where traditional encryption is detectable and restricted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghyun Lee, Omid Tavallaie, Shuaijun Chen, Kanchana Thilakarathna, Suranga Seneviratne, Adel Nadjaran Toosi, Albert Y. Zomaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Accommodating edge networks between IoT devices and the cloud server in Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) enhances communication efficiency without compromising data privacy. However, devices connected to the same edge often share geographic or contextual similarities, leading to varying edge-level data heterogeneity with different subsets of labels per edge, on top of device-level heterogeneity. This hierarchical non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature, which implies that each edge has its own optimization goal, has been overlooked in HFL research. Therefore, existing edge-accommodated HFL demonstrates inconsistent performance across edges in various hierarchical non-IID scenarios. To ensure robust performance with diverse edge-level non-IID data, we propose a Personalized Hierarchical Edge-enabled Federated Learning (PHE-FL), which personalizes each edge model to perform well on the unique class distributions specific to each edge. We evaluated PHE-FL across 4 scenarios with varying levels of edge-level non-IIDness, with extreme IoT device level non-IIDness. To accurately assess the effectiveness of our personalization approach, we deployed test sets on each edge server instead of the cloud server, and used both balanced and imbalanced test sets. Extensive experiments show that PHE-FL achieves up to 83 percent higher accuracy compared to existing federated learning approaches that incorporate edge networks, given the same number of training rounds. Moreover, PHE-FL exhibits improved stability, as evidenced by reduced accuracy fluctuations relative to the state-of-the-art FedAvg with two-level (edge and cloud) aggregation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roshan Patel, Saeed Moayedpour, Louis De Lescure, Lorenzo Kogler-Anele, Alan Cherney, Sven Jager, Yasser Jangjou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms can significantly accelerate the optimization of chemical reactions. Transfer learning can bolster the effectiveness of BO algorithms in low-data regimes by leveraging pre-existing chemical information or data outside the direct optimization task (i.e., source data). Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that chemical information present in foundation training data can give them utility for processing chemical data. Furthermore, they can be augmented with and help synthesize potentially multiple modalities of source chemical data germane to the optimization task. In this work, we examine how chemical information from LLMs can be elicited and used for transfer learning to accelerate the BO of reaction conditions to maximize yield. Specifically, we show that a survey-like prompting scheme and preference learning can be used to infer a utility function which models prior chemical information embedded in LLMs over a chemical parameter space; we find that the utility function shows modest correlation to true experimental measurements (yield) over the parameter space despite operating in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we show that the utility function can be leveraged to focus BO efforts in promising regions of the parameter space, improving the yield of the initial BO query and enhancing optimization in 4 of the 6 datasets studied. Overall, we view this work as a step towards bridging the gap between the chemistry knowledge embedded in LLMs and the capabilities of principled BO methods to accelerate reaction optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil He, Jiahong Liu, Buze Zhang, Ngoc Bui, Ali Maatouk, Menglin Yang, Irwin King, Melanie Weber, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space has been the de facto geometric setting for machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. At a large scale, real-world data often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains, such as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to effectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not merely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for the next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries, foundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned structures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to match the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency and expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and empirical investigations of prevalent foundation models.Finally, we outline a roadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models, including strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning, training from scratch, and hybrid approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahuan Long, Zhengqin Xu, Tingsong Jiang, Wen Yao, Shuai Jia, Chao Ma, Xiaoqian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a widely used vision foundation model with diverse applications, including image segmentation, detection, and tracking. Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling hierarchical data across diverse modalities. Recent studies show that token distributions in foundation models exhibit scale-free properties, suggesting that hyperbolic space is a more suitable ambient space than Euclidean space for many pre-training and downstream tasks. However, existing tools lack essential components for building hyperbolic foundation models, making it difficult to leverage recent advancements. We introduce HyperCore, a comprehensive open-source framework that provides core modules for constructing hyperbolic foundation models across multiple modalities. HyperCore's modules can be effortlessly combined to develop novel hyperbolic foundation models, eliminating the need to extensively modify Euclidean modules from scratch and possible redundant research efforts. To demonstrate its versatility, we build and test the first fully hyperbolic vision transformers (LViT) with a fine-tuning pipeline, the first fully hyperbolic multimodal CLIP model (L-CLIP), and a hybrid Graph RAG with a hyperbolic graph encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that LViT outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Additionally, we benchmark and reproduce experiments across hyperbolic GNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and vision Transformers to highlight HyperCore's advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahuan Long, Tingsong Jiang, Wen Yao, Yizhe Xiong, Zhengqin Xu, Shuai Jia, Chao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are large pre-trained models that form the backbone of various vision tasks. Fine-tuning VFMs can further unlock their potential for downstream tasks or scenarios. However, VFMs often contain significant feature redundancy, which may limit their adaptability to new tasks. In this paper, we investigate the redundancies in the segment anything model (SAM) and then propose a parameter-free fine-tuning method to address this issue. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that adjust parameters, our method emphasizes selecting, reusing, and enhancing pre-trained features, offering a new perspective on model fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a channel selection algorithm based on the model's output difference to identify redundant and effective channels. By selectively replacing the redundant channels with more effective ones, we filter out less useful features and reuse the more relevant features to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing the task-specific feature representation. Experiments on both out-of-domain and in-domain datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. Notably, our approach can seamlessly integrate with existing fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA, Adapter), further boosting the performance of already fine-tuned models. Moreover, since our channel selection involves only model inference, our method significantly reduces computational and GPU memory overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Tan, Song Wang, Yifan Li, Yu Kong, Jundong Li, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods provide interpretation by attributing predictions to input features. Natural explanations are expected to interpret how the inputs lead to the predictions. Thus, a fundamental question arises: Do these explanations unintentionally reverse the natural relationship between inputs and outputs? Specifically, are the explanations rationalizing predictions from the output rather than reflecting the true decision process? To investigate such explanatory inversion, we propose Inversion Quantification (IQ), a framework that quantifies the degree to which explanations rely on outputs and deviate from faithful input-output relationships. Using the framework, we demonstrate on synthetic datasets that widely used methods such as LIME and SHAP are prone to such inversion, particularly in the presence of spurious correlations, across tabular, image, and text domains. Finally, we propose Reproduce-by-Poking (RBP), a simple and model-agnostic enhancement to post-hoc explanation methods that integrates forward perturbation checks. We further show that under the IQ framework, RBP theoretically guarantees the mitigation of explanatory inversion. Empirically, for example, on the synthesized data, RBP can reduce the inversion by 1.8% on average across iconic post-hoc explanation approaches and domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vera Koponen</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider continuous relational structures with finite domain $[n] := \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and a many valued logic, $CLA$, with values in the unit interval and which uses continuous connectives and continuous aggregation functions. $CLA$ subsumes first-order logic on ``conventional'' finite structures. To each relation symbol $R$ and identity constraint $ic$ on a tuple the length of which matches the arity of $R$ we associate a continuous probability density function $\mu_R^{ic} : [0, 1] \to [0, \infty)$.
  We also consider a probability distribution on the set $\mathbf{W}_n$ of continuous structures with domain $[n]$ which is such that for every relation symbol $R$, identity constraint $ic$, and tuple $\bar{a}$ satisfying $ic$, the distribution of the value of $R(\bar{a})$ is given by $\mu_R^{ic}$, independently of the values for other relation symbols or other tuples.
  In this setting we prove that every formula in $CLA$ is asymptotically equivalent to a formula without any aggregation function. This is used to prove a convergence law for $CLA$ which reads as follows for formulas without free variables: If $\varphi \in CLA$ has no free variable and $I \subseteq [0, 1]$ is an interval, then there is $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ such that, as $n$ tends to infinity, the probability that the value of $\varphi$ is in $I$ tends to $\alpha$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long context processing is critical for the adoption of LLMs, but existing methods often introduce architectural complexity that hinders their practical adoption. Gisting, an in-context compression method with no architectural modification to the decoder transformer, is a promising approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing frameworks. While effective for short instructions, we demonstrate that gisting struggles with longer contexts, with significant performance drops even at minimal compression rates. Surprisingly, a simple average pooling baseline consistently outperforms gisting. We analyze the limitations of gisting, including information flow interruptions, capacity limitations and the inability to restrict its attention to subsets of the context. Motivated by theoretical insights into the performance gap between gisting and average pooling, and supported by extensive experimentation, we propose GistPool, a new in-context compression method. GistPool preserves the simplicity of gisting, while significantly boosting its performance on long context compression tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chace Ashcraft, Kiran Karra, Josh Carney, Nathan Drenkow</p>
<p>Abstract: The Treacherous Turn refers to the scenario where an artificial intelligence (AI) agent subtly, and perhaps covertly, learns to perform a behavior that benefits itself but is deemed undesirable and potentially harmful to a human supervisor. During training, the agent learns to behave as expected by the human supervisor, but when deployed to perform its task, it performs an alternate behavior without the supervisor there to prevent it. Initial experiments applying DRL to an implementation of the A Link to the Past example do not produce the treacherous turn effect naturally, despite various modifications to the environment intended to produce it. However, in this work, we find the treacherous behavior to be reproducible in a DRL agent when using other trojan injection strategies. This approach deviates from the prototypical treacherous turn behavior since the behavior is explicitly trained into the agent, rather than occurring as an emergent consequence of environmental complexity or poor objective specification. Nonetheless, these experiments provide new insights into the challenges of producing agents capable of true treacherous turn behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to multivariate forecasting cryptocurrency prices using a hybrid contextual model combining exponential smoothing (ES) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The model consists of two tracks: the context track and the main track. The context track provides additional information to the main track, extracted from representative series. This information as well as information extracted from exogenous variables is dynamically adjusted to the individual series forecasted by the main track. The RNN stacked architecture with hierarchical dilations, incorporating recently developed attentive dilated recurrent cells, allows the model to capture short and long-term dependencies across time series and dynamically weight input information. The model generates both point daily forecasts and predictive intervals for one-day, one-week and four-week horizons. We apply our model to forecast prices of 15 cryptocurrencies based on 17 input variables and compare its performance with that of comparative models, including both statistical and ML ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Arif Demirta\c{s}, Claire Zheng, Max Fowler, Kathryn Cunningham</p>
<p>Abstract: To complete an open-ended programming exercise, students need to both plan a high-level solution and implement it using the appropriate syntax. However, these problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission through test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process. Large language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting the overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this end, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns (i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that both the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these plans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by conventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller, cost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with state-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications for smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be incorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide feedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is syntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback for problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level solution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative masked transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across various content generation tasks, primarily due to their ability to effectively model large-scale dataset distributions with high consistency. However, in the animation domain, large datasets are not always available. Applying generative masked modeling to generate diverse instances from a single MoCap reference may lead to overfitting, a challenge that remains unexplored. In this work, we present MotionDreamer, a localized masked modeling paradigm designed to learn internal motion patterns from a given motion with arbitrary topology and duration. By embedding the given motion into quantized tokens with a novel distribution regularization method, MotionDreamer constructs a robust and informative codebook for local motion patterns. Moreover, a sliding window local attention is introduced in our masked transformer, enabling the generation of natural yet diverse animations that closely resemble the reference motion patterns. As demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, MotionDreamer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that are typically GAN or Diffusion-based in both faithfulness and diversity. Thanks to the consistency and robustness of the quantization-based approach, MotionDreamer can also effectively perform downstream tasks such as temporal motion editing, \textcolor{update}{crowd animation}, and beat-aligned dance generation, all using a single reference motion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi, Farahnaz Akrami, Chengkai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge graph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic benchmarks. Commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial performance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative rankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities when n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current evaluation protocols and metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Samplawski, Adam D. Cobb, Susmit Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is a promising application area for emerging artificial intelligence methods. Traditional workflows for cyberphysical systems create detailed digital models which can be evaluated by physics simulators in order to narrow the search space before creating physical prototypes. A major bottleneck of this approach is that the simulators are often computationally expensive and slow. Recent advancements in AI methods offer the possibility to accelerate these pipelines. We use the recently released AircraftVerse dataset, which is especially suited for developing and evaluating large language models for designs. AircraftVerse contains a diverse set of UAV designs represented via textual design trees together with detailed physics simulation results. Following the recent success of large language models (LLMs), we propose AGENT (Aircraft GENeraTor). AGENT is a comprehensive design tool built on the CodeT5+ LLM which learns powerful representations of aircraft textual designs directly from JSON files. We develop a curriculum of training tasks which imbues a single model with a suite of useful features. AGENT is able to generate designs conditioned on properties of flight dynamics (hover time, maximum speed, etc.). Additionally, AGENT can issue evaluations of designs allowing it to act as a surrogate model of the physics simulation that underlies the AircraftVerse dataset. We present a series of experiments which demonstrate our system's abilities. We are able to achieve strong performance using the smallest member of the CodeT5+ family (220M parameters). This allows for a flexible and powerful system which can be executed on a single GPU enabling a clear path toward future deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luna Xingyu Li, Ray-yuan Chung, Feng Chen, Wenyu Zeng, Yein Jeon, Oleg Zaslavsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Low technology and eHealth literacy among older adults in retirement communities hinder engagement with digital tools. To address this, we designed an LLM-powered chatbot prototype using a human-centered approach for a local retirement community. Through interviews and persona development, we prioritized accessibility and dual functionality: simplifying internal information retrieval and improving technology and eHealth literacy. A pilot trial with residents demonstrated high satisfaction and ease of use, but also identified areas for further improvement. Based on the feedback, we refined the chatbot using GPT-3.5 Turbo and Streamlit. The chatbot employs tailored prompt engineering to deliver concise responses. Accessible features like adjustable font size, interface theme and personalized follow-up responses were implemented. Future steps include enabling voice-to-text function and longitudinal intervention studies. Together, our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven chatbots to empower older adults through accessible, personalized interactions, bridging literacy gaps in retirement communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Ahmadi, Sarah Sharif, Yaser M. Banad</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools through standardized interfaces like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However, current MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require local process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge computing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to multiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API. Unlike existing solutions, MCP Bridge is fully LLM-agnostic, supporting any backend regardless of vendor. The system implements a risk-based execution model with three security levels standard execution, confirmation workflow, and Docker isolation while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP clients. Complementing this server-side infrastructure is a Python based MCP Gemini Agent that facilitates natural language interaction with MCP tools. The evaluation demonstrates that MCP Bridge successfully addresses the constraints of direct MCP connections while providing enhanced security controls and cross-platform compatibility, enabling sophisticated LLM-powered applications in previously inaccessible environments</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern cutting-edge AI applications are being developed over fast-evolving, heterogeneous, nascent hardware devices. This requires frequent reworking of the AI software stack to adopt bottom-up changes from new hardware, which takes time for general-purpose software libraries. Consequently, real applications often develop custom software stacks optimized for their specific workloads and hardware. Custom stacks help quick development and optimization, but incur a lot of redundant efforts across applications in writing non-portable code. This paper discusses an alternative communication library interface for AI applications that offers both portability and performance by reducing redundant efforts while maintaining flexibility for customization. We present MSCCL++, a novel abstraction of GPU communication based on separation of concerns: (1) a primitive interface provides a minimal hardware abstraction as a common ground for software and hardware developers to write custom communication, and (2) higher-level portable interfaces and specialized implementations enable optimization for different hardware environments. This approach makes the primitive interface reusable across applications while enabling highly flexible optimization. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines (NCCL, RCCL, and MSCCL), MSCCL++ achieves speedups of up to 3.8$\times$ for collective communication and up to 15\% for real-world AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is in production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and is also adopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD. MSCCL++ is open-source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/mscclpp.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have consistently proven to achieve state-of-the-art results on a lot of imaging tasks over the past years' majority of which comprise of high-quality data. However, it is important to work on low-resolution images since it could be a cheaper alternative for remote healthcare access where the primary need of automated pathology identification models occurs. Medical diagnosis using low-resolution images is challenging since critical details may not be easily identifiable. In this paper, we report classification results by experimenting on different input image sizes of Chest X-rays to deep CNN models and discuss the feasibility of classification on varying image sizes. We also leverage the noisy labels in the dataset by proposing a Randomized Flipping of labels techniques. We use an ensemble of multi-label classification models on frontal and lateral studies. Our models are trained on 5 out of the 14 chest pathologies of the publicly available CheXpert dataset. We incorporate techniques such as augmentation, regularization for model improvement and use class activation maps to visualize the neural network's decision making. Comparison with classification results on data from 200 subjects, obtained on the corresponding high-resolution images, reported in the original CheXpert paper, has been presented. For pathologies Cardiomegaly, Consolidation and Edema, we obtain 3% higher accuracy with our model architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yang Xiao, Jie Ji, Kaiyuan Deng, Bo Hui, Linke Guo, Xiaolong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have driven significant progress in various analytical tasks within 3D genomics in computational biology. However, a holistic understanding of 3D genomics knowledge remains underexplored. Here, we propose MIX-HIC, the first multimodal foundation model of 3D genome that integrates both 3D genome structure and epigenomic tracks, which obtains unified and comprehensive semantics. For accurate heterogeneous semantic fusion, we design the cross-modal interaction and mapping blocks for robust unified representation, yielding the accurate aggregation of 3D genome knowledge. Besides, we introduce the first large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million pairwise samples of Hi-C contact maps and epigenomic tracks for high-quality pre-training, enabling the exploration of functional implications in 3D genomics. Extensive experiments show that MIX-HIC can significantly surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse downstream tasks. This work provides a valuable resource for advancing 3D genomics research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes a practical approach of using supervised machine learning (ML) models to assist safety investigators to classify aviation occurrences into either incident or serious incident categories. Our implementation currently deployed as a ML web application is trained on a labelled dataset derived from publicly available aviation investigation reports. A selection of five supervised learning models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbors) were evaluated. This paper showed the best performing ML algorithm was the Random Forest Classifier with accuracy = 0.77, F1 Score = 0.78 and MCC = 0.51 (average of 100 sample runs). The study had also explored the effect of applying Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the imbalanced dataset, and the overall observation ranged from no significant effect to substantial degradation in performance for some of the models after the SMOTE adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikas Natesh, H. T. Kung</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PQS, which uses three techniques together - Prune, Quantize, and Sort - to achieve low-bitwidth accumulation of dot products in neural network computations. In conventional quantized (e.g., 8-bit) dot products, partial results are accumulated into wide (e.g., 32-bit) accumulators to avoid overflows when accumulating intermediate partial sums. However, such wide accumulators increase memory bandwidth usage and reduce energy efficiency. We show that iterative N:M pruning in floating point followed by quantization to 8 (or fewer) bits, and accumulation of partial products in a sorted order ("small to large") allows for accurate, compressed models with short dot product lengths that do not require wide accumulators. We design, analyze, and implement the PQS algorithm to eliminate accumulation overflows at inference time for several neural networks. Our method offers a 2.5x reduction in accumulator bitwidth while achieving model accuracy on par with floating-point baselines for multiple image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of machines to comprehend and produce language that is similar to that of humans has revolutionized sectors like customer service, healthcare, and finance thanks to the quick advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which are fueled by Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, because LLMs trained on large datasets may unintentionally absorb and reveal Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from user interactions, these capabilities also raise serious privacy concerns. Deep neural networks' intricacy makes it difficult to track down or stop the inadvertent storing and release of private information, which raises serious concerns about the privacy and security of AI-driven data. This study tackles these issues by detecting Generative AI weaknesses through attacks such as data extraction, model inversion, and membership inference. A privacy-preserving Generative AI application that is resistant to these assaults is then developed. It ensures privacy without sacrificing functionality by using methods to identify, alter, or remove PII before to dealing with LLMs. In order to determine how well cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS provide privacy tools for protecting AI applications, the study also examines these technologies. In the end, this study offers a fundamental privacy paradigm for generative AI systems, focusing on data security and moral AI implementation, and opening the door to a more secure and conscientious use of these tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulmajid Murad, Massimiliano Ruocco</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern air traffic management, generating synthetic flight trajectories has emerged as a promising solution for addressing data scarcity, protecting sensitive information, and supporting large-scale analyses. In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given the growing use of generative artificial intelligence as a tool for creating multilingual content and bypassing both machine and traditional translation methods, this study explores the ability of linguistically trained individuals to discern machine-generated output from human-written text (HT). After brief training sessions on the textual anomalies typically found in synthetic text (ST), twenty-three postgraduate translation students analysed excerpts of Italian prose and assigned likelihood scores to indicate whether they believed they were human-written or AI-generated (ChatGPT-4o). The results show that, on average, the students struggled to distinguish between HT and ST, with only two participants achieving notable accuracy. Closer analysis revealed that the students often identified the same textual anomalies in both HT and ST, although features such as low burstiness and self-contradiction were more frequently associated with ST. These findings suggest the need for improvements in the preparatory training. Moreover, the study raises questions about the necessity of editing synthetic text to make it sound more human-like and recommends further research to determine whether AI-generated text is already sufficiently natural-sounding not to require further refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wen, Shijie Guo, Wenbo Ning, Rui Cao, Yan Niu, Bin Wan, Peng Wei, Xiaobo Liu, Jie Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In open data sets of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the heterogeneity of the data is typically attributed to a combination of factors, including differences in scanning procedures, the presence of confounding effects, and population diversities between multiple sites. These factors contribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in turn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning network (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a representation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly (NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC). This mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical directions, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize the feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module that can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior information. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of balancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression tasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy of 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces site variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain regions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering the "black box" of deep learning to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tracking multiple objects based on textual queries is a challenging task that requires linking language understanding with object association across frames. Previous works typically train the whole process end-to-end or integrate an additional referring text module into a multi-object tracker, but they both require supervised training and potentially struggle with generalization to open-set queries. In this work, we introduce ReferGPT, a novel zero-shot referring multi-object tracking framework. We provide a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with spatial knowledge enabling it to generate 3D-aware captions. This enhances its descriptive capabilities and supports a more flexible referring vocabulary without training. We also propose a robust query-matching strategy, leveraging CLIP-based semantic encoding and fuzzy matching to associate MLLM generated captions with user queries. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTIv2 and Refer-KITTI+ demonstrate that ReferGPT achieves competitive performance against trained methods, showcasing its robustness and zero-shot capabilities in autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saikat Dutta, Akhil Vasim, Siddhant Gole, Hamid Rezatofighi, Biplab Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation beyond predefined categories is a key challenge in remote sensing, where novel and unseen classes often emerge during inference. Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p>

To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjin Ke, Zhe Li, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the efficiency of inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical area of research. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is a popular technique, but it often faces challenges at low-bit levels, particularly in downstream tasks. Quantization-aware Training (QAT) can alleviate this problem, but it requires significantly more computational resources. To tackle this, we introduced Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training (DL-QAT), which merges the advantages of QAT while training only less than 1% of the total parameters. Specifically, we introduce a group-specific quantization magnitude to adjust the overall scale of each quantization group. Within each quantization group, we use LoRA matrices to update the weight size and direction in the quantization space. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families. The results show significant improvements over our baseline method across different quantization granularities. For instance, for LLaMA-7B, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.2% in MMLU on 3-bit LLaMA-7B model. Additionally, our quantization results on pre-trained models also surpass previous QAT methods, demonstrating the superior performance and efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubing Cao, Yinfeng Yu, Yongming Li, Liejun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents AMNet, an Acoustic Model Network designed to improve the performance of Mandarin speech synthesis by incorporating phrase structure annotation and local convolution modules. AMNet builds upon the FastSpeech 2 architecture while addressing the challenge of local context modeling, which is crucial for capturing intricate speech features such as pauses, stress, and intonation. By embedding a phrase structure parser into the model and introducing a local convolution module, AMNet enhances the model's sensitivity to local information. Additionally, AMNet decouples tonal characteristics from phonemes, providing explicit guidance for tone modeling, which improves tone accuracy and pronunciation. Experimental results demonstrate that AMNet outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective evaluations. The proposed model achieves superior Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), lower Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD), and improved fundamental frequency fitting $F0 (R^2)$, confirming its ability to generate high-quality, natural, and expressive Mandarin speech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yomna Mokhtar, Tarek Shohdy, Abdallah A. Hassan, Mostafa Eshra, Omar Elmenawy, Osama Khalil, Haitham El-Hussieny</p>
<p>Abstract: Rigid robots were extensively researched, whereas soft robotics remains an underexplored field. Utilizing soft-legged robots in performing tasks as a replacement for human beings is an important stride to take, especially under harsh and hazardous conditions over rough terrain environments. For the demand to teach any robot how to behave in different scenarios, a real-time physical and visual simulation is essential. When it comes to soft robots specifically, a simulation framework is still an arduous problem that needs to be disclosed. Using the simulation open framework architecture (SOFA) is an advantageous step. However, neither SOFA's manual nor prior public SOFA projects show its maximum capabilities the users can reach. So, we resolved this by establishing customized settings and handling the framework components appropriately. Settling on perfect, fine-tuned SOFA parameters has stimulated our motivation towards implementing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) method of proximal policy optimization (PPO). The final representation is a well-defined, ready-to-deploy walking, tripedal, soft-legged robot based on PPO-RL in a SOFA environment. Robot navigation performance is a key metric to be considered for measuring the success resolution. Although in the simulated soft robots case, an 82\% success rate in reaching a single goal is a groundbreaking output, we pushed the boundaries to further steps by evaluating the progress under assigning a sequence of goals. While trailing the platform steps, outperforming discovery has been observed with an accumulative squared error deviation of 19 mm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohom Ghosh, Arnab Maji, Sudip Kumar Naskar</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting stock market prices following corporate earnings calls remains a significant challenge for investors and researchers alike, requiring innovative approaches that can process diverse information sources. This study investigates the impact of corporate earnings calls on stock prices by introducing a multi-modal predictive model. We leverage textual data from earnings call transcripts, along with images and tables from accompanying presentations, to forecast stock price movements on the trading day immediately following these calls. To facilitate this research, we developed the MiMIC (Multi-Modal Indian Earnings Calls) dataset, encompassing companies representing the Nifty 50, Nifty MidCap 50, and Nifty Small 50 indices. The dataset includes earnings call transcripts, presentations, fundamentals, technical indicators, and subsequent stock prices. We present a multimodal analytical framework that integrates quantitative variables with predictive signals derived from textual and visual modalities, thereby enabling a holistic approach to feature representation and analysis. This multi-modal approach demonstrates the potential for integrating diverse information sources to enhance financial forecasting accuracy. To promote further research in computational economics, we have made the MiMIC dataset publicly available under the CC-NC-SA-4.0 licence. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature on market reactions to corporate communications and highlights the efficacy of multi-modal machine learning techniques in financial analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koustuv Saha, Yoshee Jain, Munmun De Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: The ubiquity and widespread use of digital and online technologies have transformed mental health support, with online mental health communities (OMHCs) providing safe spaces for peer support. More recently, generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for scalable, around-the-clock mental health assistance that could potentially augment and supplement the capabilities of OMHCs. Although genAI shows promise in delivering immediate and personalized responses, their effectiveness in replicating the nuanced, experience-based support of human peers remains an open question. In this study, we harnessed 24,114 posts and 138,758 online community (OC) responses from 55 OMHCs on Reddit. We prompted several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3, and Mistral-7B) with these posts, and compared their (AI) responses to human-written (OC) responses based on a variety of linguistic measures across psycholinguistics and lexico-semantics. Our findings revealed that AI responses are more verbose, readable, and analytically structured, but lack linguistic diversity and personal narratives inherent in human-human interactions. Through a qualitative examination, we found validation as well as complementary insights into the nature of AI responses, such as its neutrality of stance and the absence of seeking back-and-forth clarifications. We discuss the ethical and practical implications of integrating generative AI into OMHCs, advocating for frameworks that balance AI's scalability and timeliness with the irreplaceable authenticity, social interactiveness, and expertise of human connections that form the ethos of online support communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashmi Banerjee, Adithi Satish, Fitri Nur Aisyah, Wolfgang W\"orndl, Yashar Deldjoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) are crucial in personalizing travel experiences by tailoring recommendations to users' preferences, constraints, and contextual factors. However, publicly available travel datasets often lack sufficient breadth and depth, limiting their ability to support advanced personalization strategies -- particularly for sustainable travel and off-peak tourism. In this work, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic travel queries that emulate diverse user personas and incorporate structured filters such as budget constraints and sustainability preferences.
  This paper introduces a novel SynthTRIPs framework for generating synthetic travel queries using LLMs grounded in a curated knowledge base (KB). Our approach combines persona-based preferences (e.g., budget, travel style) with explicit sustainability filters (e.g., walkability, air quality) to produce realistic and diverse queries. We mitigate hallucination and ensure factual correctness by grounding the LLM responses in the KB. We formalize the query generation process and introduce evaluation metrics for assessing realism and alignment. Both human expert evaluations and automatic LLM-based assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic dataset in capturing complex personalization aspects underrepresented in existing datasets. While our framework was developed and tested for personalized city trip recommendations, the methodology applies to other recommender system domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyan Vaithilingam, Munyeong Kim, Frida-Cecilia Acosta-Parenteau, Daniel Lee, Amine Mhedhbi, Elena L. Glassman, Ian Arawjo</p>
<p>Abstract: How do we update AI memory of user intent as intent changes? We consider how an AI interface may assist the integration of new information into a repository of natural language data. Inspired by software engineering concepts like impact analysis, we develop methods and a UI for managing semantic changes with non-local effects, which we call "semantic conflict resolution." The user commits new intent to a project -- makes a "semantic commit" -- and the AI helps the user detect and resolve semantic conflicts within a store of existing information representing their intent (an "intent specification"). We develop an interface, SemanticCommit, to better understand how users resolve conflicts when updating intent specifications such as Cursor Rules and game design documents. A knowledge graph-based RAG pipeline drives conflict detection, while LLMs assist in suggesting resolutions. We evaluate our technique on an initial benchmark. Then, we report a 12 user within-subjects study of SemanticCommit for two task domains -- game design documents, and AI agent memory in the style of ChatGPT memories -- where users integrated new information into an existing list. Half of our participants adopted a workflow of impact analysis, where they would first flag conflicts without AI revisions then resolve conflicts locally, despite having access to a global revision feature. We argue that AI agent interfaces, such as software IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf, should provide affordances for impact analysis and help users validate AI retrieval independently from generation. Our work speaks to how AI agent designers should think about updating memory as a process that involves human feedback and decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training LLMs in distributed environments presents significant challenges due to the complexity of model execution, deployment systems, and the vast space of configurable strategies. Although various optimization techniques exist, achieving high efficiency in practice remains difficult. Accurate performance models that effectively characterize and predict a model's behavior are essential for guiding optimization efforts and system-level studies. We propose Lumos, a trace-driven performance modeling and estimation toolkit for large-scale LLM training, designed to accurately capture and predict the execution behaviors of modern LLMs. We evaluate Lumos on a production ML cluster with up to 512 NVIDIA H100 GPUs using various GPT-3 variants, demonstrating that it can replay execution time with an average error of just 3.3%, along with other runtime details, across different models and configurations. Additionally, we validate its ability to estimate performance for new setups from existing traces, facilitating efficient exploration of model and deployment configurations.</p>

Drawing on cognitive psychology and computational linguistics, it examines how confirmation bias, commonly understood as the tendency to seek information that aligns with existing beliefs, can be replicated and amplified by the design and functioning of large language models. The article analyzes the mechanisms by which confirmation bias may manifest in chatbot interactions, assesses the ethical and practical risks associated with such bias, and proposes a range of mitigation strategies. These include technical interventions, interface redesign, and policy measures aimed at promoting balanced AI-generated discourse. The article concludes by outlining future research directions, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and empirical evaluation to better understand and address confirmation bias in generative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichao Yuan, Lin Ma, Nishil Talati</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs, characterized by their sparse activation patterns, offer a promising approach to scaling language models while avoiding proportionally increasing the inference cost. However, their large parameter sizes present deployment challenges in resource-constrained environments with limited GPU memory capacity, as GPU memory is often insufficient to accommodate the full set of model weights. Consequently, typical deployments rely on CPU-GPU hybrid execution: the GPU handles compute-intensive GEMM operations, while the CPU processes the relatively lightweight attention mechanism. This setup introduces a key challenge: how to effectively optimize resource utilization across CPU and GPU? Prior work has designed system optimizations based on performance models with limited scope. Specifically, such models do not capture the complex interactions between hardware properties and system execution mechanisms. Therefore, previous approaches neither identify nor achieve the hardware limit.
  This paper presents MoE-Lens, a high-throughput MoE LLM inference system designed through holistic performance modeling for resource-constrained environments. Our performance model thoroughly analyzes various fundamental system components, including CPU memory capacity, GPU compute power, and workload characteristics, to understand the theoretical performance upper bound of MoE inference. Furthermore, it captures the system execution mechanisms to identify the key hardware bottlenecks and accurately predict the achievable throughput. Informed by our performance model, MoE-Lens introduces an inference system approaching hardware limits. Evaluated on diverse MoE models and datasets, MoE-Lens outperforms the state-of-the-art solution by 4.6x on average (up to 25.5x), with our theoretical model predicting performance with an average 94% accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) speech generation and voice cloning technologies have produced naturalistic speech and accurate voice replication, yet their influence on sociotechnical systems across diverse accents and linguistic traits is not fully understood. This study evaluates two synthetic AI voice services (Speechify and ElevenLabs) through a mixed methods approach using surveys and interviews to assess technical performance and uncover how users' lived experiences influence their perceptions of accent variations in these speech technologies. Our findings reveal technical performance disparities across five regional, English-language accents and demonstrate how current speech generation technologies may inadvertently reinforce linguistic privilege and accent-based discrimination, potentially creating new forms of digital exclusion. Overall, our study highlights the need for inclusive design and regulation by providing actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and organizations to ensure equitable and socially responsible AI speech technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iason Chaimalas, Arnas Vy\v{s}niauskas, Gabriel Brostow</p>
<p>Abstract: Automation of existing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is important but hard to achieve. Upstream of making the GUI user-accessible or somehow scriptable, even the data-collection to understand the original interface poses significant challenges. For example, large quantities of general UI data seem helpful for training general machine learning (ML) models, but accessibility for each person can hinge on the ML's precision on a specific app. We therefore take the perspective that a given user needs confidence, that the relevant UI elements are being detected correctly throughout one app or digital environment. We mostly assume that the target application is known in advance, so that data collection and ML-training can be personalized for the test-time target domain. The proposed Explorer system focuses on detecting on-screen buttons and text-entry fields, i.e. interactables, where the training process has access to a live version of the application. The live application can run on almost any popular platform except iOS phones, and the collection is especially streamlined for Android phones or for desktop Chrome browsers. Explorer also enables the recording of interactive user sessions, and subsequent mapping of how such sessions overlap and sometimes loop back to similar states. We show how having such a map enables a kind of path planning through the GUI, letting a user issue audio commands to get to their destination. Critically, we are releasing our code for Explorer openly at https://github.com/varnelis/Explorer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duy-Cat Can, Quang-Huy Tang, Huong Ha, Binh T. Nguyen, Oliver Y. Ch\'en</p>
<p>Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, is central to disease management. Existing deep learning models require large-scale annotated datasets and often function as "black boxes". Additionally, datasets in clinical practice are frequently small or unlabeled, restricting the full potential of deep learning methods. Here, we introduce REMEMBER -- Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning -- a new machine learning framework that facilitates zero- and few-shot Alzheimer's diagnosis using brain MRI scans through a reference-based reasoning process. Specifically, REMEMBER first trains a contrastively aligned vision-text model using expert-annotated reference data and extends pseudo-text modalities that encode abnormality types, diagnosis labels, and composite clinical descriptions. Then, at inference time, REMEMBER retrieves similar, human-validated cases from a curated dataset and integrates their contextual information through a dedicated evidence encoding module and attention-based inference head. Such an evidence-guided design enables REMEMBER to imitate real-world clinical decision-making process by grounding predictions in retrieved imaging and textual context. Specifically, REMEMBER outputs diagnostic predictions alongside an interpretable report, including reference images and explanations aligned with clinical workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that REMEMBER achieves robust zero- and few-shot performance and offers a powerful and explainable framework to neuroimaging-based diagnosis in the real world, especially under limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stella C. Dong, James R. Finlay</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for insurance reserving that integrates tail-risk sensitivity, macroeconomic regime modeling, and regulatory compliance. The reserving problem is formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which reserve adjustments are optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) subject to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraints. To enhance policy robustness across varying economic conditions, the agent is trained using a regime-aware curriculum that progressively increases volatility exposure.
  The reward structure penalizes reserve shortfall, capital inefficiency, and solvency floor violations, with design elements informed by Solvency II and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) frameworks. Empirical evaluations on two industry datasets--Workers' Compensation, and Other Liability--demonstrate that the RL-CVaR agent achieves superior performance relative to classical reserving methods across multiple criteria, including tail-risk control (CVaR$_{0.95}$), capital efficiency, and regulatory violation rate. The framework also accommodates fixed-shock stress testing and regime-stratified analysis, providing a principled and extensible approach to reserving under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feijiang Han, Licheng Guo, Hengtao Cui, Zhiyuan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks that require a deep understanding of complex questions, especially when faced with long-range dependencies or multi-step reasoning. This work investigates the limitations of current LLMs in question comprehension and identifies three insights: (1) repeating question tokens improves comprehension by increasing attention to question regions, (2) increased backward dependencies negatively affect performance due to unidirectional attentional constraints, and (3) recalibrating attentional mechanisms to prioritize question-relevant regions improves performance.
  Based on these findings, we first propose a family of prompt-based strategies - Step-by-Step Reading (SSR), SSR+, and SSR++ - that guide LLMs to incrementally process question tokens and align their reasoning with the input structure. These methods significantly improve performance, with SSR++ achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks: 96.66% on GSM8K, 94.61% on ASDiv, and 76.28% on AQuA. Second, we introduce a training-free attention recalibration mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention distributions during inference to emphasize question-relevant regions. This method improves the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1-8B on AQuA by 5.17% without changing model parameters or input prompts.
  Taken together, our results highlight the importance of structured prompt design and attention optimization in improving LLM comprehension, providing lightweight yet effective tools for improving performance in various NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengao Wang, Arjun Chandra, Aoming Liu, Venkatesh Saligrama, Boqing Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Wang, Dandan Lin, Wenqing Lin, Ziming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (\emph{e.g.}, images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model \textsc{FROG} that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at \kw{Tencent} have demonstrated the superiority of \textsc{FROG} over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikael Makonnen, Moritz Vandenhirtz, Sonia Laguna, Julia E Vogt</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by structuring predictions around human-understandable concepts. However, unintended information leakage, where predictive signals bypass the concept bottleneck, compromises their transparency. This paper introduces an information-theoretic measure to quantify leakage in CBMs, capturing the extent to which concept embeddings encode additional, unintended information beyond the specified concepts. We validate the measure through controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting leakage trends across various configurations. Our findings highlight that feature and concept dimensionality significantly influence leakage, and that classifier choice impacts measurement stability, with XGBoost emerging as the most reliable estimator. Additionally, preliminary investigations indicate that the measure exhibits the anticipated behavior when applied to soft joint CBMs, suggesting its reliability in leakage quantification beyond fully synthetic settings. While this study rigorously evaluates the measure in controlled synthetic experiments, future work can extend its application to real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wen, Shijie Guo, Wenbo Ning, Rui Cao, Jie Xiang, Xiaobo Liu, Jintai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuro-developmental disorders are manifested as dysfunctions in cognition, communication, behaviour and adaptability, and deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can alleviate the increasingly strained healthcare resources on neuroimaging. However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pucheng Dang, Di Huang, Dong Li, Kang Chen, Yuanbo Wen, Qi Guo, Xing Hu, Ninghui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-tree kernel patches are essential for adapting the Linux kernel to new hardware or enabling specific functionalities. Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration. However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification. In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities. Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 72.59% (50.74% improvement) for migration tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun-Gill Kang, Dohyeon Lee, Soohee Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical drones with multi rotors are generally less maneuverable due to unidirectional thrust, which may be unfavorable to agile flight in very narrow and confined spaces. This paper suggests a new bio-inspired drone that is empowered with high maneuverability in a lightweight and easy-to-carry way. The proposed flying squirrel inspired drone has controllable foldable wings to cover a wider range of flight attitudes and provide more maneuverable flight capability with stable tracking performance. The wings of a drone are fabricated with silicone membranes and sophisticatedly controlled by reinforcement learning based on human-demonstrated data. Specially, such learning based wing control serves to capture even the complex aerodynamics that are often impossible to model mathematically. It is shown through experiment that the proposed flying squirrel drone intentionally induces aerodynamic drag and hence provides the desired additional repulsive force even under saturated mechanical thrust. This work is very meaningful in demonstrating the potential of biomimicry and machine learning for realizing an animal-like agile drone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) have gained widespread adoption in Open-Vocabulary (OV) object detection and segmentation tasks. Despite they have shown promise on OV-related tasks, their effectiveness in conventional vision tasks has thus far been unevaluated. In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharanya Dasgupta, Sujoy Nath, Arkaprabha Basu, Pourya Shamsolmoali, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered widespread attention due to their adeptness at generating innovative responses to the given prompts across a multitude of domains. However, LLMs often suffer from the inherent limitation of hallucinations and generate incorrect information while maintaining well-structured and coherent responses. In this work, we hypothesize that hallucinations stem from the internal dynamics of LLMs. Our observations indicate that, during passage generation, LLMs tend to deviate from factual accuracy in subtle parts of responses, eventually shifting toward misinformation. This phenomenon bears a resemblance to human cognition, where individuals may hallucinate while maintaining logical coherence, embedding uncertainty within minor segments of their speech. To investigate this further, we introduce an innovative approach, HalluShift, designed to analyze the distribution shifts in the internal state space and token probabilities of the LLM-generated responses. Our method attains superior performance compared to existing baselines across various benchmark datasets. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/sharanya-dasgupta001/hallushift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Wu, Xunkai Li, Yinlin Zhu, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for its distributed training capabilities in graph-based machine intelligence applications, mitigating data silos while offering a new perspective for privacy-preserve large-scale graph learning. However, multi-level FGL heterogeneity presents various client-server collaboration challenges: (1) Model-level: The variation in clients for expected performance and scalability necessitates the deployment of heterogeneous models. Unfortunately, most FGL methods rigidly demand identical client models due to the direct model weight aggregation on the server. (2) Data-level: The intricate nature of graphs, marked by the entanglement of node profiles and topology, poses an optimization dilemma. This implies that models obtained by federated training struggle to achieve superior performance. (3) Communication-level: Some FGL methods attempt to increase message sharing among clients or between clients and the server to improve training, which inevitably leads to high communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedPG as a general prototype-guided optimization method for the above multi-level FGL heterogeneity. Specifically, on the client side, we integrate multi-level topology-aware prototypes to capture local graph semantics. Subsequently, on the server side, leveraging the uploaded prototypes, we employ topology-guided contrastive learning and personalized technology to tailor global prototypes for each client, broadcasting them to improve local training. Experiments demonstrate that FedPG outperforms SOTA baselines by an average of 3.57\% in accuracy while reducing communication costs by 168x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony C. Constantinou, Nicholas Higgins, Neville K. Kitson</p>
<p>Abstract: Hattrick is a free web-based probabilistic football manager game with over 200,000 users competing for titles at national and international levels. Launched in Sweden in 1997 as part of an MSc project, the game's slow-paced design has fostered a loyal community, with many users remaining active for decades. Hattrick's game-engine mechanics are partially hidden, and users have attempted to decode them with incremental success over the years. Rule-based, statistical and machine learning models have been developed to aid this effort and are widely used by the community. However, these models or tools have not been formally described or evaluated in the scientific literature. This study is the first to explore Hattrick using structure learning techniques and Bayesian networks, integrating both data and domain knowledge to develop models capable of explaining and simulating the game engine. We present a comprehensive analysis assessing the effectiveness of structure learning algorithms in relation to knowledge-based structures, and show that while structure learning may achieve a higher overall network fit, it does not result in more accurate predictions for selected variables of interest, when compared to knowledge-based networks that produce a lower overall network fit. Additionally, we introduce and publicly share a fully specified Bayesian network model that matches the performance of top models used by the Hattrick community. We further demonstrate how analysis extends beyond prediction by providing a visual representation of conditional dependencies, and using the best performing Bayesian network model for in-game decision-making. To support future research, we make all data, graphical structures, and models publicly available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Sun, Renat Aksitov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Nolan Andrew Miller, Max Vladymyrov, Ulrich Rueckert, Been Kim, Mark Sandler</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce "Outlandish," a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

<p>Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform loco-manipulation tasks in complex, unstructured environments poses significant challenges. This entails equipping robots with the capability to plan actions over extended horizons while leveraging multi-modality to bridge gaps between high-level planning and actual task execution. Recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models have showcased substantial potential in enhancing planning and reasoning abilities, particularly in the comprehension and processing of semantic information for robotic control tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on foundation models that applies the embodied chain of action reasoning methodology to autonomously plan actions from textual instructions for humanoid loco-manipulation. Our method integrates humanoid-specific chain of thought methodology, including detailed affordance and body movement analysis, which provides a breakdown of the task into a sequence of locomotion and manipulation actions. Moreover, we incorporate spatial reasoning based on the observation and target object properties to effectively navigate where target position may be unseen or occluded. Through rigorous experimental setups on object rearrangement, manipulations and loco-manipulation tasks on a real-world environment, we evaluate our method's efficacy on the decoupled upper and lower body control and demonstrate the effectiveness of the chain of robotic action reasoning strategies in comprehending human instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqian Li, Yuxi Ma, Jiajun Yan, Bo Dai, Yujia Peng, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The role of mental simulation in human physical reasoning is widely acknowledged, but whether it is employed across scenarios with varying simulation costs and where its boundary lies remains unclear. Using a pouring-marble task, our human study revealed two distinct error patterns when predicting pouring angles, differentiated by simulation time. While mental simulation accurately captured human judgments in simpler scenarios, a linear heuristic model better matched human predictions when simulation time exceeded a certain boundary. Motivated by these observations, we propose a dual-process framework, Simulation-Heuristics Model (SHM), where intuitive physics employs simulation for short-time simulation but switches to heuristics when simulation becomes costly. By integrating computational methods previously viewed as separate into a unified model, SHM quantitatively captures their switching mechanism. The SHM aligns more precisely with human behavior and demonstrates consistent predictive performance across diverse scenarios, advancing our understanding of the adaptive nature of intuitive physical reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Generalizable Gaussian Splatting have enabled robust 3D reconstruction from sparse input views by utilizing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models, achieving superior cross-scene generalization. However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations typically demands extensive domain expertise, limiting broader access. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced scientific computing, their use in automating CFD workflows is underdeveloped. We introduce a novel approach centered on domain-specific LLM adaptation. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on NL2FOAM, our custom dataset of 28716 natural language-to-OpenFOAM configuration pairs with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, we enable direct translation from natural language descriptions to executable CFD setups. A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency. The results highlight the critical role of domain-specific adaptation in deploying LLM assistants for complex engineering workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohyeon Lee, Jun-Gill Kang, Soohee Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Drones, like most airborne aerial vehicles, face inherent disadvantages in achieving agile flight due to their limited thrust capabilities. These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone.

Although existing methods that combine multiple models suffer from inference costs and architectural constraints, MHCG avoids these problems by performing decentralized Bayesian inference through a process resembling a language game. The knowledge fusion process establishes communication between two VLM agents alternately captioning images and learning from each other. We conduct two image-captioning experiments with two VLMs, each pre-trained on a different dataset. The first experiment demonstrates that MHCG achieves consistent improvement in reference-free evaluation metrics. The second experiment investigates how MHCG contributes to sharing VLMs' category-level vocabulary by observing the occurrence of the vocabulary in the generated captions.</p>

Although prior work has explored pure language-based 3D grounding, there has been limited exploration of 3D-ERU, which also incorporates human pointing gestures. To address this gap, we introduce a data augmentation framework-Imputer, and use it to curate a new benchmark dataset-ImputeRefer for 3D-ERU, by incorporating human pointing gestures into existing 3D scene datasets that only contain language instructions. We also propose Ges3ViG, a novel model for 3D-ERU that achieves ~30% improvement in accuracy as compared to other 3D-ERU models and ~9% compared to other purely language-based 3D grounding models.

That is, for making recommendations, these methods typically encodes user historical interactions to obtain user representations and directly match these representations with candidate item representations. However, due to the limited capacity of traditional lightweight recommendation models, this one-step inference paradigm often leads to suboptimal performance. To tackle this issue, we present a novel slow thinking recommendation model, named STREAM-Rec. Our approach is capable of analyzing historical user behavior, generating a multi-step, deliberative reasoning process, and ultimately delivering personalized recommendations. In particular, we focus on two key challenges: (1) identifying the suitable reasoning patterns in recommender systems, and (2) exploring how to effectively stimulate the reasoning capabilities of traditional recommenders. To this end, we introduce a three-stage training framework. In the first stage, the model is pretrained on large-scale user behavior data to learn behavior patterns and capture long-range dependencies. In the second stage, we design an iterative inference algorithm to annotate suitable reasoning traces by progressively refining the model predictions. This annotated data is then used to fine-tune the model. Finally, in the third stage, we apply reinforcement learning to further enhance the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aung Kyaw Htet, Mark Dras</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite dramatic recent progress in NLP, it is still a major challenge to apply Large Language Models (LLM) to low-resource languages. This is made visible in benchmarks such as Cross-Lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI), a key task that demonstrates cross-lingual capabilities of NLP systems across a set of 15 languages. In this paper, we extend the XNLI task for one additional low-resource language, Myanmar, as a proxy challenge for broader low-resource languages, and make three core contributions. First, we build a dataset called Myanmar XNLI (myXNLI) using community crowd-sourced methods, as an extension to the existing XNLI corpus. This involves a two-stage process of community-based construction followed by expert verification; through an analysis, we demonstrate and quantify the value of the expert verification stage in the context of community-based construction for low-resource languages. We make the myXNLI dataset available to the community for future research. Second, we carry out evaluations of recent multilingual language models on the myXNLI benchmark, as well as explore data-augmentation methods to improve model performance. Our data-augmentation methods improve model accuracy by up to 2 percentage points for Myanmar, while uplifting other languages at the same time. Third, we investigate how well these data-augmentation methods generalise to other low-resource languages in the XNLI dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenny Ma, Riya Sahni, Karthik Sreedhar, Lydia B. Chilton</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent large language model simulations have the potential to model complex human behaviors and interactions. If the mechanics are set up properly, unanticipated and valuable social dynamics can surface. However, it is challenging to consistently enforce simulation mechanics while still allowing for notable and emergent dynamics. We present AgentDynEx, an AI system that helps set up simulations from user-specified mechanics and dynamics. AgentDynEx uses LLMs to guide users through a Configuration Matrix to identify core mechanics and define milestones to track dynamics. It also introduces a method called \textit{nudging}, where the system dynamically reflects on simulation progress and gently intervenes if it begins to deviate from intended outcomes. A technical evaluation found that nudging enables simulations to have more complex mechanics and maintain its notable dynamics compared to simulations without nudging. We discuss the importance of nudging as a technique for balancing mechanics and dynamics of multi-agent simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Cheng, Amira Hijazi, Jeren Konak, Alan Erera, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans.
  This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christophe El Zeinaty, Wassim Hamidouche, Glenn Herrou, Daniel Menard, Merouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for designing efficient neural network architectures specifically tailored to tiny machine learning (TinyML) platforms. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for neural architecture search (NAS), a vision transformer (ViT)-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, and an explainability module, the approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. The LLM-guided search explores a hierarchical search space, refining candidate architectures through Pareto optimization based on accuracy, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and memory metrics. The best-performing architectures are further fine-tuned using logits-based KD with a pre-trained ViT-B/16 model, which enhances generalization without increasing model size. Evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset and deployed on an STM32H7 microcontroller (MCU), the three proposed models, LMaNet-Elite, LMaNet-Core, and QwNet-Core, achieve accuracy scores of 74.50%, 74.20% and 73.00%, respectively. All three models surpass current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MCUNet-in3/in4 (69.62% / 72.86%) and XiNet (72.27%), while maintaining a low computational cost of less than 100 million MACs and adhering to the stringent 320 KB static random-access memory (SRAM) constraint. These results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed framework for TinyML platforms, underscoring the potential of combining LLM-driven search, Pareto optimization, KD, and explainability to develop accurate, efficient, and interpretable models. This approach opens new possibilities in NAS, enabling the design of efficient architectures specifically suited for TinyML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Celal Ziftci, Stoyan Nikolov, Anna Sj\"ovall, Bo Kim, Daniele Codecasa, Max Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Developers often evolve an existing software system by making internal changes, called migration. Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations.
  Migration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling. Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete. Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations.
  In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned.
  Our case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations.
  Our results suggest that our automated, LLM-assisted workflow can serve as a model for similar initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Jiang, Saeed Hassanpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language and vision tasks, but their application to gene expression analysis remains limited due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and missing values. We present GexBERT, a transformer-based autoencoder framework for robust representation learning of gene expression data. GexBERT learns context-aware gene embeddings by pretraining on large-scale transcriptomic profiles with a masking and restoration objective that captures co-expression relationships among thousands of genes. We evaluate GexBERT across three critical tasks in cancer research: pan-cancer classification, cancer-specific survival prediction, and missing value imputation. GexBERT achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy from limited gene subsets, improves survival prediction by restoring expression of prognostic anchor genes, and outperforms conventional imputation methods under high missingness. Furthermore, its attention-based interpretability reveals biologically meaningful gene patterns across cancer types. These findings demonstrate the utility of GexBERT as a scalable and effective tool for gene expression modeling, with translational potential in settings where gene coverage is limited or incomplete.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM jailbreaks are a widespread safety challenge. Given this problem has not yet been tractable, we suggest targeting a key failure mechanism: the failure of safety to generalize across semantically equivalent inputs. We further focus the target by requiring desirable tractability properties of attacks to study: explainability, transferability between models, and transferability between goals. We perform red-teaming within this framework by uncovering new vulnerabilities to multi-turn, multi-image, and translation-based attacks. These attacks are semantically equivalent by our design to their single-turn, single-image, or untranslated counterparts, enabling systematic comparisons; we show that the different structures yield different safety outcomes. We then demonstrate the potential for this framework to enable new defenses by proposing a Structure Rewriting Guardrail, which converts an input to a structure more conducive to safety assessment. This guardrail significantly improves refusal of harmful inputs, without over-refusing benign ones. Thus, by framing this intermediate challenge - more tractable than universal defenses but essential for long-term safety - we highlight a critical milestone for AI safety research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reliance on translated or adapted datasets from English or multilingual resources introduces challenges regarding linguistic and cultural suitability. This study addresses the need for robust and culturally appropriate benchmarks by evaluating the quality of 17 commonly used Turkish benchmark datasets. Using a comprehensive framework that assesses six criteria, both human and LLM-judge annotators provide detailed evaluations to identify dataset strengths and shortcomings.
  Our results reveal that 70% of the benchmark datasets fail to meet our heuristic quality standards. The correctness of the usage of technical terms is the strongest criterion, but 85% of the criteria are not satisfied in the examined datasets. Although LLM judges demonstrate potential, they are less effective than human annotators, particularly in understanding cultural common sense knowledge and interpreting fluent, unambiguous text. GPT-4o has stronger labeling capabilities for grammatical and technical tasks, while Llama3.3-70B excels at correctness and cultural knowledge evaluation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for more rigorous quality control in creating and adapting datasets for low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Ganzfried</p>
<p>Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work aims to interpret human behavior to anticipate potential user confusion when a robot provides explanations for failure, allowing the robot to adapt its explanations for more natural and efficient collaboration. Using a dataset that included facial emotion detection, eye gaze estimation, and gestures from 55 participants in a user study, we analyzed how human behavior changed in response to different types of failures and varying explanation levels. Our goal is to assess whether human collaborators are ready to accept less detailed explanations without inducing confusion. We formulate a data-driven predictor to predict human confusion during robot failure explanations. We also propose and evaluate a mechanism, based on the predictor, to adapt the explanation level according to observed human behavior. The promising results from this evaluation indicate the potential of this research in adapting a robot's explanations for failures to enhance the collaborative experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's globalized world, there are increasing opportunities for individuals to communicate using a common non-native language (lingua franca). Non-native speakers often have opportunities to listen to foreign languages, but may not comprehend them as fully as native speakers do. To aid real-time comprehension, live transcription of subtitles is frequently used in everyday life (e.g., during Zoom conversations, watching YouTube videos, or on social networking sites). However, simultaneously reading subtitles while listening can increase cognitive load. In this study, we propose Dynamik, a system that reduces cognitive load during reading by decreasing the size of less important words and enlarging important ones, thereby enhancing sentence contrast. Our results indicate that Dynamik can reduce certain aspects of cognitive load, specifically, participants' perceived performance and effort among individuals with low proficiency in English, as well as enhance the users' sense of comprehension, especially among people with low English ability. We further discuss our methods' applicability to other languages and potential improvements and further research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting transitions between intro/credits and main content in videos is a crucial task for content segmentation, indexing, and recommendation systems. Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization. Future work will explore multimodal learning, incorporating audio features and subtitles to further enhance detection accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.
  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Chitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables large language models to solve multi-step tasks by framing problem solving as sequential decision problems. Outcome-based rewards, which provide feedback only on final answers, show impressive success, but face challenges with credit assignment and slow convergence. In contrast, procedure-based rewards offer efficient step-level feedback, but typically require costly human supervision. We introduce \emph{Backwards Adaptive Reward Shaping} (BARS), a no-regret framework that converts sparse outcomes-based rewards into effective procedure-based signals. BARS uses sparse rewards generated from terminal-state priors and cover trees to scale rewards while preventing exploitation. With Bellman contraction and $(\Delta, \epsilon)$-gap rewards, our backward Euler solver achieves $\epsilon$-accuracy in $O\left((R_{\max}/\Delta)\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$ iterations with $O(\log T)$ dynamic regret over $T$ rounds. Our analysis, based on generic chaining, continuous scaling limits, and non-linear Feynman-Kac bounds, connects recent outcome-based methods' empirical successes with the benefits of intermediate supervision. Combined, this provides the first rigorous no-regret algorithm for outcome reward shaping, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of DeepSeek's R1.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI is already impacting learning and help-seeking. While the benefits of generative AI are well-understood, recent studies have also raised concerns about increased potential for cheating and negative impacts on students' metacognition and critical thinking. However, the potential impacts on social interactions, peer learning, and classroom dynamics are not yet well understood. To investigate these aspects, we conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with undergraduate computing students across seven R1 universities in North America. Our findings suggest that help-seeking requests are now often mediated by generative AI. For example, students often redirected questions from their peers to generative AI instead of providing assistance themselves, undermining peer interaction. Students also reported feeling increasingly isolated and demotivated as the social support systems they rely on begin to break down. These findings are concerning given the important role that social interactions play in students' learning and sense of belonging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtian Wu, Claire Cardie</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks like question answering and fact verification, they continue to suffer from hallucinations and reasoning errors, especially in multi-hop tasks that require integration of multiple information sources. Current methods address these issues through retrieval-based techniques (grounding reasoning in external evidence), reasoning-based approaches (enhancing coherence via improved prompting), or hybrid strategies combining both elements. One prominent hybrid method, ReAct, has outperformed purely retrieval-based or reasoning-based approaches; however, it lacks internal verification of intermediate reasoning steps, allowing potential errors to propagate through complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning Court (RC), a novel framework that extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval methods, such as ReAct, with a dedicated LLM judge. Unlike ReAct, RC employs this judge to independently evaluate multiple candidate answers and their associated reasoning generated by separate LLM agents. The judge is asked to select the answer that it considers the most factually grounded and logically coherent based on the presented reasoning and evidence, or synthesizes a new answer using available evidence and its pre-trained knowledge if all candidates are inadequate, flawed, or invalid. Evaluations on multi-hop benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and fact-verification (FEVER) demonstrate that RC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot prompting methods without task-specific fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Liu, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporally consistent video-to-video generation is essential for applications of video diffusion models in areas such as sim-to-real, style-transfer, video upsampling, etc. In this paper, we propose a video diffusion framework that leverages temporally consistent noise to generate coherent video frames without specialized modules or additional constraints. We show that the standard training objective of diffusion models, when applied with temporally consistent noise, encourages the model to be equivariant to spatial transformations in input video and noise. This enables our model to better follow motion patterns from the input video, producing aligned motion and high-fidelity frames. Furthermore, we extend our approach to 3D-consistent video generation by attaching noise as textures on 3D meshes, ensuring 3D consistency in sim-to-real applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in motion alignment, 3D consistency, and video quality while requiring only a few sampling steps in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryota Tanaka, Taichi Iki, Taku Hasegawa, Kyosuke Nishida, Kuniko Saito, Jun Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: We aim to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that answers questions over a corpus of visually-rich documents presented in mixed modalities (e.g., charts, tables) and diverse formats (e.g., PDF, PPTX). In this paper, we introduce a new RAG framework, VDocRAG, which can directly understand varied documents and modalities in a unified image format to prevent missing information that occurs by parsing documents to obtain text. To improve the performance, we propose novel self-supervised pre-training tasks that adapt large vision-language models for retrieval by compressing visual information into dense token representations while aligning them with textual content in documents. Furthermore, we introduce OpenDocVQA, the first unified collection of open-domain document visual question answering datasets, encompassing diverse document types and formats. OpenDocVQA provides a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating retrieval and question answering models on visually-rich documents in an open-domain setting. Experiments show that VDocRAG substantially outperforms conventional text-based RAG and has strong generalization capability, highlighting the potential of an effective RAG paradigm for real-world documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dinh Dai Quan Tran, Hoang-Thien Nguyen. Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Gia-Van To, Tien-Huy Nguyen, Quan Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation accuracy by leveraging a small set of labeled images alongside a larger pool of unlabeled data. Recent advances primarily focus on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and co-training strategies. However, existing methods struggle to balance global semantic representation with fine-grained local feature extraction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tri-branch semi-supervised segmentation framework incorporating a dual-teacher strategy, named IGL-DT. Our approach employs SwinUnet for high-level semantic guidance through Global Context Learning and ResUnet for detailed feature refinement via Local Regional Learning. Additionally, a Discrepancy Learning mechanism mitigates over-reliance on a single teacher, promoting adaptive feature learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior segmentation performance across various data regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan Zhou, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Dayu Zhang, Xiongtao Zhang, Yaohong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has been extensively studied and applied due to its ability to ensure data security in distributed environments while building better models. However, clients participating in federated learning still face limitations, as clients with different structures or tasks cannot participate in learning together. In view of this, constructing a federated learning framework that allows collaboration between clients with different model structures and performing different tasks, enabling them to share valuable knowledge to enhance model efficiency, holds significant practical implications for the widespread application of federated learning. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-task federated learning with encoder-decoder structure (M-Fed). Specifically, given the widespread adoption of the encoder-decoder architecture in current models, we leverage this structure to share intra-task knowledge through traditional federated learning methods and extract general knowledge from the encoder to achieve cross-task knowledge sharing. The training process is similar to traditional federated learning, and we incorporate local decoder and global decoder information into the loss function. The local decoder iteratively updates and gradually approaches the global decoder until sufficient cross-task knowledge sharing is achieved. Our method is lightweight and modular, demonstrating innovation compared to previous research. It enables clients performing different tasks to share general knowledge while maintaining the efficiency of traditional federated learning systems. We conducted experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets to verify the feasibility of M-Fed and compared it with traditional methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of M-Fed in multi-task federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenrui Cai, Chengyu Wang, Junbing Yan, Jun Huang, Xiangzhong Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need to explore strategies to train effective reasoning LLMs with far fewer parameters. A critical challenge is that smaller models have different capacities and cognitive trajectories than their larger counterparts. Hence, direct distillation of chain-of-thought (CoT) results from large LLMs to smaller ones can be sometimes ineffective and requires a huge amount of annotated data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV), designed for training smaller yet powerful reasoning LLMs. Our CRV framework consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique abilities: (i) critiquing the CoTs according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. We further propose the cognitive preference optimization (CogPO) algorithm to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning thoughts of these models with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CRV and CogPO, which outperforms other training methods by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Li, Haichao Miao, Xinyuan Yan, Valerio Pascucci, Matthew Berger, Shusen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly. This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks. Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy). However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem. During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided. We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal. It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge). This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering. Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan Zhou, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Zhengyi Zhong, Dayu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although multi-task learning is widely applied in intelligent services, traditional multi-task modeling methods often require customized designs based on specific task combinations, resulting in a cumbersome modeling process. Inspired by the rapid development and excellent performance of single-task models, this paper proposes an efficient multi-task modeling method that can automatically fuse trained single-task models with different structures and tasks to form a multi-task model. As a general framework, this method allows modelers to simply prepare trained models for the required tasks, simplifying the modeling process while fully utilizing the knowledge contained in the trained models. This eliminates the need for excessive focus on task relationships and model structure design. To achieve this goal, we consider the structural differences among various trained models and employ model decomposition techniques to hierarchically decompose them into multiple operable model components. Furthermore, we have designed an Adaptive Knowledge Fusion (AKF) module based on Transformer, which adaptively integrates intra-task and inter-task knowledge based on model components. Through the proposed method, we achieve efficient and automated construction of multi-task models, and its effectiveness is verified through extensive experiments on three datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Korel Gundem, Zhengling Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline sequential feature-based pricing and inventory control problem where the current demand depends on the past demand levels and any demand exceeding the available inventory is lost. Our goal is to leverage the offline dataset, consisting of past prices, ordering quantities, inventory levels, covariates, and censored sales levels, to estimate the optimal pricing and inventory control policy that maximizes long-term profit. While the underlying dynamic without censoring can be modeled by Markov decision process (MDP), the primary obstacle arises from the observed process where demand censoring is present, resulting in missing profit information, the failure of the Markov property, and a non-stationary optimal policy. To overcome these challenges, we first approximate the optimal policy by solving a high-order MDP characterized by the number of consecutive censoring instances, which ultimately boils down to solving a specialized Bellman equation tailored for this problem. Inspired by offline reinforcement learning and survival analysis, we propose two novel data-driven algorithms to solving these Bellman equations and, thus, estimate the optimal policy. Furthermore, we establish finite sample regret bounds to validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in estimating the optimal policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven approach to learning optimal pricing and inventory control policies in a sequential decision-making environment characterized by censored and dependent demand.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisheng Zhang, Derui Wang, Qianyi Yang, Pengyang Huang, Junhan Pu, Yuxin Cao, Kai Ye, Jie Hao, Yixian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech synthesis technology has brought great convenience, while the widespread usage of realistic deepfake audio has triggered hazards. Malicious adversaries may unauthorizedly collect victims' speeches and clone a similar voice for illegal exploitation (\textit{e.g.}, telecom fraud). However, the existing defense methods cannot effectively prevent deepfake exploitation and are vulnerable to robust training techniques. Therefore, a more effective and robust data protection method is urgently needed. In response, we propose a defensive framework, \textit{\textbf{SafeSpeech}}, which protects the users' audio before uploading by embedding imperceptible perturbations on original speeches to prevent high-quality synthetic speech. In SafeSpeech, we devise a robust and universal proactive protection technique, \textbf{S}peech \textbf{PE}rturbative \textbf{C}oncealment (\textbf{SPEC}), that leverages a surrogate model to generate universally applicable perturbation for generative synthetic models. Moreover, we optimize the human perception of embedded perturbation in terms of time and frequency domains. To evaluate our method comprehensively, we conduct extensive experiments across advanced models and datasets, both subjectively and objectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that SafeSpeech achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) voice protection effectiveness and transferability and is highly robust against advanced adaptive adversaries. Moreover, SafeSpeech has real-time capability in real-world tests. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech}{https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Feng, Xudong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized popular business applications dealing with tabular data, i.e., tabular agents. Although LLMs are observed to be vulnerable against prompt injection attacks from external data sources, tabular agents impose strict data formats and predefined rules on the attacker's payload, which are ineffective unless the agent navigates multiple layers of structural data to incorporate the payload. To address the challenge, we present a novel attack termed StruPhantom which specifically targets black-box LLM-powered tabular agents. Our attack designs an evolutionary optimization procedure which continually refines attack payloads via the proposed constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search augmented by an off-topic evaluator. StruPhantom helps systematically explore and exploit the weaknesses of target applications to achieve goal hijacking. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of StruPhantom across various LLM-based agents, including those on real-world platforms, and attack scenarios. Our attack achieves over 50% higher success rates than baselines in enforcing the application's response to contain phishing links or malicious codes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern frameworks for training large foundation models (LFMs) employ data loaders in a data parallel paradigm. While this design offers implementation simplicity, it introduces two fundamental challenges. First, due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention operator, the non-uniform sample distribution over data-parallel ranks leads to a significant workload imbalance among loaders, which degrades the training efficiency. This paradigm also impedes the implementation of data mixing algorithms (e.g., curriculum learning) over different datasets. Second, to acquire a broad range of capability, LFMs training ingests data from diverse sources, each with distinct file access states. Colocating massive datasets within loader instances can easily exceed local pod memory capacity. Additionally, heavy sources with higher transformation latency require larger worker pools, further exacerbating memory consumption.
  We present OVERLORD, an industrial-grade distributed data loading architecture with three innovations: (1) A centralized and declarative data plane, which facilitates elastic data orchestration strategy, such as long-short context, multimodal, and curriculum learning; (2) Disaggregated multisource preprocessing through role-specific actors, i.e., Source Loaders and Data Constructors, leveraging autoscaling for Source Loaders towards heterogeneous and evolving source preprocessing cost; (3) Shadow Loaders with differential checkpointing for uninterrupted fault recovery. Deployed on production clusters scaling to multi-thousand GPU, OVERLORD achieves: (1) 4.5x end-to-end training throughput improvement, (2) a minimum 3.6x reduction in CPU memory usage, with further improvements to be added in later experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asiful Arefeen, Saman Khamesian, Maria Adela Grando, Bithika Thompson, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Frequent and long-term exposure to hyperglycemia (i.e., high blood glucose) increases the risk of chronic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Current technologies like continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) primarily model specific aspects of glycemic control-like hypoglycemia prediction or insulin delivery. Similarly, most digital twin approaches in diabetes management simulate only physiological processes. These systems lack the ability to offer alternative treatment scenarios that support proactive behavioral interventions. To address this, we propose GlyTwin, a novel digital twin framework that uses counterfactual explanations to simulate optimal treatments for glucose regulation. Our approach helps patients and caregivers modify behaviors like carbohydrate intake and insulin dosing to avoid abnormal glucose events. GlyTwin generates behavioral treatment suggestions that proactively prevent hyperglycemia by recommending small adjustments to daily choices, reducing both frequency and duration of these events. Additionally, it incorporates stakeholder preferences into the intervention design, making recommendations patient-centric and tailored. We evaluate GlyTwin on AZT1D, a newly constructed dataset with longitudinal data from 21 type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients on automated insulin delivery systems over 26 days. Results show GlyTwin outperforms state-of-the-art counterfactual methods, generating 76.6% valid and 86% effective interventions. These findings demonstrate the promise of counterfactual-driven digital twins in delivering personalized healthcare.</p>

By integrating area-efficient approximate multipliers into Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units, our approach effectively reduces silicon area and fabrication overhead while maintaining high computational accuracy. Experimental evaluations across three technology nodes (45nm, 14nm, and 7nm) show that our method reduces embodied carbon by up to 30% with negligible accuracy drop.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective pest management is complex due to the need for accurate, context-specific decisions. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) open new possibilities for addressing these challenges by providing sophisticated, adaptive knowledge acquisition and reasoning. However, existing LLM-based pest management approaches often rely on a single-agent paradigm, which can limit their capacity to incorporate diverse external information, engage in systematic validation, and address complex, threshold-driven decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PestMA, an LLM-based multi-agent system (MAS) designed to generate reliable and evidence-based pest management advice. Building on an editorial paradigm, PestMA features three specialized agents, an Editor for synthesizing pest management recommendations, a Retriever for gathering relevant external data, and a Validator for ensuring correctness. Evaluations on real-world pest scenarios demonstrate that PestMA achieves an initial accuracy of 86.8% for pest management decisions, which increases to 92.6% after validation. These results underscore the value of collaborative agent-based workflows in refining and validating decisions, highlighting the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems to automate and enhance pest management processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucinda Gullison, Feng Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation are significant barriers to achieving widespread vaccination coverage. Smaller public health departments may lack the expertise or resources to craft effective vaccine messaging. This paper explores the potential of ChatGPT-augmented messaging to promote confidence in vaccination uptake.
  We conducted a survey in which participants chose between pairs of vaccination messages and assessed which was more persuasive and to what extent. In each pair, one message was the original, and the other was augmented by ChatGPT. At the end of the survey, participants were informed that half of the messages had been generated by ChatGPT. They were then asked to provide both quantitative and qualitative responses regarding how knowledge of a message's ChatGPT origin affected their impressions.
  Overall, ChatGPT-augmented messages were rated slightly higher than the original messages. These messages generally scored better when they were longer. Respondents did not express major concerns about ChatGPT-generated content, nor was there a significant relationship between participants' views on ChatGPT and their message ratings. Notably, there was a correlation between whether a message appeared first or second in a pair and its score.
  These results point to the potential of ChatGPT to enhance vaccine messaging, suggesting a promising direction for future research on human-AI collaboration in public health communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose SUMART, a method for summarizing and compressing the volume of verbose subtitle translations. SUMART is designed for understanding translated captions (e.g., interlingual conversations via subtitle translation or when watching movies in foreign language audio and translated captions). SUMART is intended for users who want a big-picture and fast understanding of the conversation, audio, video content, and speech in a foreign language. During the training data collection, when a speaker makes a verbose statement, SUMART employs a large language model on-site to compress the volume of subtitles. This compressed data is then stored in a database for fine-tuning purposes. Later, SUMART uses data pairs from those non-compressed ASR results and compressed translated results for fine-tuning the translation model to generate more concise translations for practical uses. In practical applications, SUMART utilizes this trained model to produce concise translation results. Furthermore, as a practical application, we developed an application that allows conversations using subtitle translation in augmented reality spaces. As a pilot study, we conducted qualitative surveys using a SUMART prototype and a survey on the summarization model for SUMART. We envision the most effective use case of this system is where users need to consume a lot of information quickly (e.g., Speech, lectures, podcasts, Q&A in conferences).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isabel O. Gallegos, Chen Shani, Weiyan Shi, Federico Bianchi, Izzy Gainsburg, Dan Jurafsky, Robb Willer</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables the creation and dissemination of information at massive scale and speed, it is increasingly important to understand how people perceive AI-generated content. One prominent policy proposal requires explicitly labeling AI-generated content to increase transparency and encourage critical thinking about the information, but prior research has not yet tested the effects of such labels. To address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment (N=1601) on a diverse sample of Americans, presenting participants with an AI-generated message about several public policies (e.g., allowing colleges to pay student-athletes), randomly assigning whether participants were told the message was generated by (a) an expert AI model, (b) a human policy expert, or (c) no label. We found that messages were generally persuasive, influencing participants' views of the policies by 9.74 percentage points on average. However, while 94.6% of participants assigned to the AI and human label conditions believed the authorship labels, labels had no significant effects on participants' attitude change toward the policies, judgments of message accuracy, nor intentions to share the message with others. These patterns were robust across a variety of participant characteristics, including prior knowledge of the policy, prior experience with AI, political party, education level, or age. Taken together, these results imply that, while authorship labels would likely enhance transparency, they are unlikely to substantially affect the persuasiveness of the labeled content, highlighting the need for alternative strategies to address challenges posed by AI-generated information.</p>

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in medical image segmentation, their performance is often limited by the need for large-scale annotated datasets - an impractical requirement in clinical ultrasound imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a compelling solution by leveraging unlabeled data, but existing teacher-student frameworks often suffer from confirmation bias and high computational costs. We propose HDC, a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework that integrates Hierarchical Distillation and Consistency learning within a multi-level noise mean-teacher framework. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on pseudo-labeling, we introduce a hierarchical distillation mechanism that guides feature-level learning via two novel objectives: (1) Correlation Guidance Loss to align feature representations between the teacher and main student branch, and (2) Mutual Information Loss to stabilize representations between the main and noisy student branches. Our framework reduces model complexity while improving generalization. Extensive experiments on two fetal ultrasound datasets, FUGC and PSFH, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead than existing multi-teacher models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atul Kumar, Nisha Gupta, Saswati Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: Short technical support pages such as IBM Technotes are quite common in technical support domain. These pages can be very useful as the knowledge sources for technical support applications such as chatbots, search engines and question-answering (QA) systems. Information extracted from documents to drive technical support applications is often stored in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG). Building KGs from a large corpus of documents poses a challenge of granularity because a large number of entities and actions are present in each page. The KG becomes virtually unusable if all entities and actions from these pages are stored in the KG. Therefore, only key entities and actions from each page are extracted and stored in the KG. This approach however leads to loss of knowledge represented by entities and actions left out of the KG as they are no longer available to graph search and reasoning functions. We propose a set of techniques to create micro knowledge graph (micrograph) for each of such web pages. The micrograph stores all the entities and actions in a page and also takes advantage of the structure of the page to represent exactly in which part of that page these entities and actions appeared, and also how they relate to each other. These micrographs can be used as additional knowledge sources by technical support applications. We define schemas for representing semi-structured and plain text knowledge present in the technical support web pages. Solutions in technical support domain include procedures made of steps. We also propose a technique to extract procedures from these webpages and the schemas to represent them in the micrographs. We also discuss how technical support applications can take advantage of the micrographs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Yin, Min-Sung Yoon, Yuchi Huo, Kang Zhang, Sung-Eui Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Task execution for object rearrangement could be challenged by Task-Level Perturbations (TLP), i.e., unexpected object additions, removals, and displacements that can disrupt underlying visual policies and fundamentally compromise task feasibility and progress. To address these challenges, we present LangPert, a language-based framework designed to detect and mitigate TLP situations in tabletop rearrangement tasks. LangPert integrates a Visual Language Model (VLM) to comprehensively monitor policy's skill execution and environmental TLP, while leveraging the Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) reasoning mechanism to enhance the Large Language Model (LLM)'s contextual understanding and generate adaptive, corrective skill-execution plans. Our experimental results demonstrate that LangPert handles diverse TLP situations more effectively than baseline methods, achieving higher task completion rates, improved execution efficiency, and potential generalization to unseen scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang He, Zhi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive video streaming systems are designed to optimize Quality of Experience (QoE) and, in turn, enhance user satisfaction. However, differences in user profiles and video content lead to different weights for QoE factors, resulting in user-specific QoE functions and, thus, varying optimization objectives. This variability poses significant challenges for neural networks, as they often struggle to generalize under evolving targets - a phenomenon known as plasticity loss that prevents conventional models from adapting effectively to changing optimization objectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE), a novel learning framework that dynamically modulates network plasticity by balancing memory retention with selective forgetting. In particular, PA-MoE leverages noise injection to promote the selective forgetting of outdated knowledge, thereby endowing neural networks with enhanced adaptive capabilities. In addition, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of PA-MoE by deriving a regret bound that quantifies its learning performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PA-MoE achieves a 45.5% improvement in QoE over competitive baselines in dynamic streaming environments. Further analysis reveals that the model effectively mitigates plasticity loss by optimizing neuron utilization. Finally, a parameter sensitivity study is performed by injecting varying levels of noise, and the results align closely with our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farha Nausheen, Khandakar Ahmed, M Imad Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent developments, deep learning methodologies applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revealed a paradox: They improve performance but demand considerable data and resources for their training. Alternatively, quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the computational limitations of current methodologies, thereby establishing an emerging field known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). This domain holds the potential to attain a quantum advantage in the processing of linguistic structures, surpassing classical models in both efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, it is proposed to categorise QNLP models based on quantum computing principles, architecture, and computational approaches. This paper attempts to provide a survey on how quantum meets language by mapping state-of-the-art in this area, embracing quantum encoding techniques for classical data, QNLP models for prevalent NLP tasks, and quantum optimisation techniques for hyper parameter tuning. The landscape of quantum computing approaches applied to various NLP tasks is summarised by showcasing the specific QNLP methods used, and the popularity of these methods is indicated by their count. From the findings, it is observed that QNLP approaches are still limited to small data sets, with only a few models explored extensively, and there is increasing interest in the application of quantum computing to natural language processing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dish images play a crucial role in the digital era, with the demand for culturally distinctive dish images continuously increasing due to the digitization of the food industry and e-commerce. In general cases, existing text-to-image generation models excel in producing high-quality images; however, they struggle to capture diverse characteristics and faithful details of specific domains, particularly Chinese dishes. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-Dish, the first text-to-image generation model specifically tailored for Chinese dishes. We develop a comprehensive dish curation pipeline, building the largest dish dataset to date. Additionally, we introduce a recaption strategy and employ a coarse-to-fine training scheme to help the model better learn fine-grained culinary nuances. During inference, we enhance the user's textual input using a pre-constructed high-quality caption library and a large language model, enabling more photorealistic and faithful image generation. Furthermore, to extend our model's capability for dish editing tasks, we propose Concept-Enhanced P2P. Based on this approach, we build a dish editing dataset and train a specialized editing model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyu Wu, Boyang Pang, Xunkai Li, Yinlin Zhu, Daohan Su, Bowen Fan, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Zhu, Fanbin Mo, Zheng Zhang, Jiaxi Wang, Yiming Shi, Ming Wu, Chuang Zhang, Miao Li, Ji Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing bipedal robots capable of traversing diverse real-world terrains presents a fundamental robotics challenge, as existing methods using predefined height maps and static environments fail to address the complexity of unstructured landscapes. To bridge this gap, we propose GenTe, a framework for generating physically realistic and adaptable terrains to train generalizable locomotion policies. GenTe constructs an atomic terrain library that includes both geometric and physical terrains, enabling curriculum training for reinforcement learning-based locomotion policies. By leveraging function-calling techniques and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GenTe generates complex, contextually relevant terrains from textual and graphical inputs. The framework introduces realistic force modeling for terrain interactions, capturing effects such as soil sinkage and hydrodynamic resistance. To the best of our knowledge, GenTe is the first framework that systemically generates simulation environments for legged robot locomotion control. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark of 100 generated terrains. Experiments demonstrate improved generalization and robustness in bipedal robot locomotion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Luque-Cerpa, Elizabeth Polgreen, Ajitha Rajan, Hazem Torfah</p>
<p>Abstract: Class activation mapping (CAM) is a widely adopted class of saliency methods used to explain the behavior of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods generate heatmaps that highlight the parts of the input most relevant to the CNN output. Various CAM methods have been proposed, each distinguished by the expressions used to derive heatmaps. In general, users look for heatmaps with specific properties that reflect different aspects of CNN functionality. These may include similarity to ground truth, robustness, equivariance, and more. Although existing CAM methods implicitly encode some of these properties in their expressions, they do not allow for variability in heatmap generation following the user's intent or domain knowledge. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing SyCAM, a metric-based approach for synthesizing CAM expressions. Given a predefined evaluation metric for saliency maps, SyCAM automatically generates CAM expressions optimized for that metric. We specifically explore a syntax-guided synthesis instantiation of SyCAM, where CAM expressions are derived based on predefined syntactic constraints and the given metric. Using several established evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of our approach in generating targeted heatmaps. We compare SyCAM with other well-known CAM methods on three prominent models: ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Jiyang Guan, Jian Liang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress, yet their safety alignment remains limited. Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Air quality prediction plays a crucial role in public health and environmental protection. Accurate air quality prediction is a complex multivariate spatiotemporal problem, that involves interactions across temporal patterns, pollutant correlations, spatial station dependencies, and particularly meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and chemical transformations. Existing works underestimate the critical role of atmospheric conditions in air quality prediction and neglect comprehensive meteorological data utilization, thereby impairing the modeling of dynamic interdependencies between air quality and meteorological data. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that explicitly models air quality observations and atmospheric conditions as distinct modalities, integrating multi-pressure-level meteorological data and weather forecasts to capture atmosphere-pollution dependencies for prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet demonstrate MDSTNet's superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54\% compared to the state-of-the-art model.

<p>Abstract: Existing pedestrian attribute recognition methods are generally developed based on RGB frame cameras. However, these approaches are constrained by the limitations of RGB cameras, such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and motion blur, which hinder their performance. Furthermore, current attribute recognition primarily focuses on analyzing pedestrians' external appearance and clothing, lacking an exploration of emotional dimensions. In this paper, we revisit these issues and propose a novel multi-modal RGB-Event attribute recognition task by drawing inspiration from the advantages of event cameras in low-light, high-speed, and low-power consumption. Specifically, we introduce the first large-scale multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition dataset, termed EventPAR, comprising 100K paired RGB-Event samples that cover 50 attributes related to both appearance and six human emotions, diverse scenes, and various seasons. By retraining and evaluating mainstream PAR models on this dataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and provide a solid foundation for future research in terms of data and algorithmic baselines. In addition, we propose a novel RWKV-based multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition framework, featuring an RWKV visual encoder and an asymmetric RWKV fusion module. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed dataset as well as two simulated datasets (MARS-Attribute and DukeMTMC-VID-Attribute), achieving state-of-the-art results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yin, Gunagzong Si, Zilei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment, making its early diagnosis through fundus imaging critical for effective treatment planning. However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors such as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts yields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR screening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass restoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind restoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus images in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low quality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest restored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method can learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing its limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies to minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate PTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on DeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for diabetic retinopathy detection. Our result demonstrates state of the art performance, showcasing PTL's potential as a superior approach to iterative image quality restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rick den Otter, Gabriel Weindel, Sjoerd Stuit, Leendert van Maanen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the sequence of cognitive operations that underlie decision-making is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Traditional approaches often rely on group-level statistics, which obscure trial-by-trial variations in cognitive strategies. In this study, we introduce a novel machine learning method that combines Hidden Multivariate Pattern analysis with a Structured State Space Sequence model to decode cognitive strategies from electroencephalography data at the trial level. We apply this method to a decision-making task, where participants were instructed to prioritize either speed or accuracy in their responses. Our results reveal an additional cognitive operation, labeled Confirmation, which seems to occur predominantly in the accuracy condition but also frequently in the speed condition. The modeled probability that this operation occurs is associated with higher probability of responding correctly as well as changes of mind, as indexed by electromyography data. By successfully modeling cognitive operations at the trial level, we provide empirical evidence for dynamic variability in decision strategies, challenging the assumption of homogeneous cognitive processes within experimental conditions. Our approach shows the potential of sequence modeling in cognitive neuroscience to capture trial-level variability that is obscured by aggregate analyses. The introduced method offers a new way to detect and understand cognitive strategies in a data-driven manner, with implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in many fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanwen Wan, Yifei Chen, Zeyu Wei, Dongrui Li, Zexin Lin, Donghao Wu, Jiu Cheng, Yuxiang Zhang, Xiaoqiang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces EmbodiedAgent, a hierarchical framework for heterogeneous multi-robot control. EmbodiedAgent addresses critical limitations of hallucination in impractical tasks. Our approach integrates a next-action prediction paradigm with a structured memory system to decompose tasks into executable robot skills while dynamically validating actions against environmental constraints. We present MultiPlan+, a dataset of more than 18,000 annotated planning instances spanning 100 scenarios, including a subset of impractical cases to mitigate hallucination. To evaluate performance, we propose the Robot Planning Assessment Schema (RPAS), combining automated metrics with LLM-aided expert grading. Experiments demonstrate EmbodiedAgent's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving 71.85% RPAS score. Real-world validation in an office service task highlights its ability to coordinate heterogeneous robots for long-horizon objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments, including evaluation on question answering and data-to-text tasks, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks, two of which were annotated by us and are being publicly released to facilitate further research. Beyond its strong in-domain performance, TOHA maintains remarkable domain transferability across multiple open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context video understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) faces a critical challenge: balancing computational efficiency with the retention of fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns. Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Divyaksh Shukla, Ashutosh Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Commonsense reasoning deals with the implicit knowledge that is well understood by humans and typically acquired via interactions with the world. In recent times, commonsense reasoning and understanding of various LLMs have been evaluated using text-based tasks. In this work, we argue that a proxy of this understanding can be maintained as a graphical structure that can further help to perform a rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning abilities about various real-world activities. We create an annotation scheme for capturing this implicit knowledge in the form of a graphical structure for 37 daily human activities. We find that the created resource can be used to frame an enormous number of commonsense queries (~ 10^{17}), facilitating rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning in LLMs. Moreover, recently, the remarkable performance of LLMs has raised questions about whether these models are truly capable of reasoning in the wild and, in general, how reasoning occurs inside these models. In this resource paper, we bridge this gap by proposing design mechanisms that facilitate research in a similar direction. Our findings suggest that the reasoning components are localized in LLMs that play a prominent role in decision-making when prompted with a commonsense query.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sports video analysis is a key domain in computer vision, enabling detailed spatial understanding through multi-view correspondences. In this work, we introduce SoccerNet-v3D and ISSIA-3D, two enhanced and scalable datasets designed for 3D scene understanding in soccer broadcast analysis. These datasets extend SoccerNet-v3 and ISSIA by incorporating field-line-based camera calibration and multi-view synchronization, enabling 3D object localization through triangulation. We propose a monocular 3D ball localization task built upon the triangulation of ground-truth 2D ball annotations, along with several calibration and reprojection metrics to assess annotation quality on demand. Additionally, we present a single-image 3D ball localization method as a baseline, leveraging camera calibration and ball size priors to estimate the ball's position from a monocular viewpoint. To further refine 2D annotations, we introduce a bounding box optimization technique that ensures alignment with the 3D scene representation. Our proposed datasets establish new benchmarks for 3D soccer scene understanding, enhancing both spatial and temporal analysis in sports analytics. Finally, we provide code to facilitate access to our annotations and the generation pipelines for the datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of generating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way that enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems. Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michal Danilowski, Soumyajit Chatterjee, Abhirup Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on test samples at runtime, and shifts from the training data distribution can significantly reduce accuracy. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models during inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original training set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like algorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model architectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to mobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark designed to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge devices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources and usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to categories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts within a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios using benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed. Furthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by advocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation. Experiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small datasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity and complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific resource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\times$ with $512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi versus the base model. BoTTA offers actionable guidance for TTA in real-world, resource-constrained deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiansheng Li, Xingxuan Zhang, Hao Zou, Yige Guo, Renzhe Xu, Yilong Liu, Chuzhao Zhu, Yue He, Peng Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Current object detectors often suffer significant perfor-mance degradation in real-world applications when encountering distributional shifts. Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) methods have proven highly effective in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks with verifiable solutions such as mathematics and coding. However, applying this idea to machine translation (MT), where outputs are flexibly formatted and difficult to automatically evaluate with explicit rules, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first open-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised fine-tuning or cold-start. We propose a rule-metric mixed reward mechanism to guide LLMs towards improved translation quality via emergent reasoning. On the WMT 24 English-Chinese benchmark, our MT-R1-Zero-3B-Mix achieves competitive performance, surpassing TowerInstruct-7B-v0.2 by an average of 1.26 points. Meanwhile, our MT-R1-Zero-7B-Mix attains a high average score of 62.25 across all metrics, placing it on par with advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, while the MT-R1-Zero-7B-Sem variant achieves state-of-the-art scores on semantic metrics. Moreover, our work exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution MT tasks, robustly supporting multilingual and low-resource settings. Extensive analysis of model behavior across different initializations and reward metrics offers pioneering insight into the critical role of reward design, LLM adaptability, training dynamics, and emergent reasoning patterns within the R1-Zero paradigm for MT.

<p>Abstract: Live tracking of wildlife via high-resolution video processing directly onboard drones is widely unexplored and most existing solutions rely on streaming video to ground stations to support navigation. Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive -- a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated animal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational autonomy.</p>

Using HaluAgent, we construct C-FAITH, a Chinese QA hallucination benchmark created from 1,399 knowledge documents obtained from web scraping, totaling 60,702 entries. We comprehensively evaluate 16 mainstream LLMs with our proposed C-FAITH, providing detailed experimental results and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyadeep Pal, Changsheng Wang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various complex tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deyuan Liu, Peng Sun, Xufeng Li, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Veniamin Veselovsky, Berke Argin, Benedikt Stroebl, Chris Wendler, Robert West, James Evans, Thomas L. Griffiths, Arvind Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Just as humans display language patterns influenced by their native tongue when speaking new languages, LLMs often default to English-centric responses even when generating in other languages. Nevertheless, we observe that local cultural information persists within the models and can be readily activated for cultural customization. We first demonstrate that explicitly providing cultural context in prompts significantly improves the models' ability to generate culturally localized responses. We term the disparity in model performance with versus without explicit cultural context the explicit-implicit localization gap, indicating that while cultural knowledge exists within LLMs, it may not naturally surface in multilingual interactions if cultural context is not explicitly provided. Despite the explicit prompting benefit, however, the answers reduce in diversity and tend toward stereotypes. Second, we identify an explicit cultural customization vector, conserved across all non-English languages we explore, which enables LLMs to be steered from the synthetic English cultural world-model toward each non-English cultural world. Steered responses retain the diversity of implicit prompting and reduce stereotypes to dramatically improve the potential for customization. We discuss the implications of explicit cultural customization for understanding the conservation of alternative cultural world models within LLMs, and their controllable utility for translation, cultural customization, and the possibility of making the explicit implicit through soft control for expanded LLM function and appeal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqiang Cao, Linnan Zhao, Jiaxuan Zhao, Fang Liu, Puhua Chen, Wenping Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex video object segmentation continues to face significant challenges in small object recognition, occlusion handling, and dynamic scene modeling. This report presents our solution, which ranked second in the MOSE track of CVPR 2025 PVUW Challenge. Based on an existing segmentation framework, we propose an improved model named MASSeg for complex video object segmentation, and construct an enhanced dataset, MOSE+, which includes typical scenarios with occlusions, cluttered backgrounds, and small target instances. During training, we incorporate a combination of inter-frame consistent and inconsistent data augmentation strategies to improve robustness and generalization. During inference, we design a mask output scaling strategy to better adapt to varying object sizes and occlusion levels. As a result, MASSeg achieves a J score of 0.8250, F score of 0.9007, and a J&F score of 0.8628 on the MOSE test set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gergely B\'ari, L\'aszl\'o Palkovics</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, autonomous driving has become a popular field of study. As control at tire grip limit is essential during emergency situations, algorithms developed for racecars are useful for road cars too. This paper examines the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the problem of grip limit driving in a simulated environment. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method is used to train an agent to control the steering wheel and pedals of the vehicle, using only visual inputs to achieve professional human lap times. The paper outlines the formulation of the task of time optimal driving on a race track as a deep reinforcement learning problem, and explains the chosen observations, actions, and reward functions. The results demonstrate human-like learning and driving behavior that utilize maximum tire grip potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language model deployments in consumer-facing applications introduce numerous risks. While existing research on harms and hazards of such applications follows top-down approaches derived from regulatory frameworks and theoretical analyses, empirical evidence of real-world failure modes remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RealHarm, a dataset of annotated problematic interactions with AI agents built from a systematic review of publicly reported incidents. Analyzing harms, causes, and hazards specifically from the deployer's perspective, we find that reputational damage constitutes the predominant organizational harm, while misinformation emerges as the most common hazard category. We empirically evaluate state-of-the-art guardrails and content moderation systems to probe whether such systems would have prevented the incidents, revealing a significant gap in the protection of AI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Characterization of atomic-scale materials traditionally requires human experts with months to years of specialized training. Even for trained human operators, accurate and reliable characterization remains challenging when examining newly discovered materials such as two-dimensional (2D) structures. This bottleneck drives demand for fully autonomous experimentation systems capable of comprehending research objectives without requiring large training datasets. In this work, we present ATOMIC (Autonomous Technology for Optical Microscopy & Intelligent Characterization), an end-to-end framework that integrates foundation models to enable fully autonomous, zero-shot characterization of 2D materials. Our system integrates the vision foundation model (i.e., Segment Anything Model), large language models (i.e., ChatGPT), unsupervised clustering, and topological analysis to automate microscope control, sample scanning, image segmentation, and intelligent analysis through prompt engineering, eliminating the need for additional training. When analyzing typical MoS2 samples, our approach achieves 99.7% segmentation accuracy for single layer identification, which is equivalent to that of human experts. In addition, the integrated model is able to detect grain boundary slits that are challenging to identify with human eyes. Furthermore, the system retains robust accuracy despite variable conditions including defocus, color temperature fluctuations, and exposure variations. It is applicable to a broad spectrum of common 2D materials-including graphene, MoS2, WSe2, SnSe-regardless of whether they were fabricated via chemical vapor deposition or mechanical exfoliation. This work represents the implementation of foundation models to achieve autonomous analysis, establishing a scalable and data-efficient characterization paradigm that fundamentally transforms the approach to nanoscale materials research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhu, Yupeng He, Ehsan-Ul Haq, Gareth Tyson, Pan Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to simulate human decision-making processes, enabling their use as agents in modeling sophisticated social networks, both offline and online. Recent research has explored collective behavioral patterns and structural characteristics of LLM agents within simulated networks. However, empirical comparisons between LLM-driven and human-driven online social networks remain scarce, limiting our understanding of how LLM agents differ from human users. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of Chirper.ai, an X/Twitter-like social network entirely populated by LLM agents, comprising over 65,000 agents and 7.7 million AI-generated posts. For comparison, we collect a parallel dataset from Mastodon, a human-driven decentralized social network, with over 117,000 users and 16 million posts. We examine key differences between LLM agents and humans in posting behaviors, abusive content, and social network structures. Our findings provide critical insights into the evolving landscape of online social network analysis in the AI era, offering a comprehensive profile of LLM agents in social simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advancement of speech synthesis technology, users have higher expectations for the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech. But previous research ignores the importance of prompt selection. This study proposes a text-to-speech (TTS) framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which can dynamically adjust the speech style according to the text content to achieve more natural and vivid communication effects. We have constructed a speech style knowledge database containing high-quality speech samples in various contexts and developed a style matching scheme. This scheme uses embeddings, extracted by Llama, PER-LLM-Embedder,and Moka, to match with samples in the knowledge database, selecting the most appropriate speech style for synthesis. Furthermore, our empirical research validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our demo can be viewed at: https://thuhcsi.github.io/icme2025-AutoStyle-TTS</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Noroozizadeh, Sayantan Kumar, Jeremy C. Weiss</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical case reports encode rich, temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Chen, Lei Sun, Jing Tang, Geng Li, Xiangxiang Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models. The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult. In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable. Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons. Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance. Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Zhang, Shuaiyi Nie, Xinghua Zhang, Zefeng Zhang, Tingwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce S1-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate Large Reasoning Models' (LRMs) performance on simple tasks that favor intuitive system 1 thinking rather than deliberative system 2 reasoning. While LRMs have achieved significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks through explicit chains of thought, their reliance on deep analytical thinking may limit their system 1 thinking capabilities. Moreover, a lack of benchmark currently exists to evaluate LRMs' performance in tasks that require such capabilities. To fill this gap, S1-Bench presents a set of simple, diverse, and naturally clear questions across multiple domains and languages, specifically designed to assess LRMs' performance in such tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation of 22 LRMs reveals significant lower efficiency tendencies, with outputs averaging 15.5 times longer than those of traditional small LLMs. Additionally, LRMs often identify correct answers early but continue unnecessary deliberation, with some models even producing numerous errors. These findings highlight the rigid reasoning patterns of current LRMs and underscore the substantial development needed to achieve balanced dual-system thinking capabilities that can adapt appropriately to task complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangcheng Jin, Yuqi Wang, Peixin Ma, Guodong Yang, Pan Zhao, En Li, Zhengtao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving robust locomotion on complex terrains remains a challenge due to high dimensional control and environmental uncertainties. This paper introduces a teacher prior framework based on the teacher student paradigm, integrating imitation and auxiliary task learning to improve learning efficiency and generalization. Unlike traditional paradigms that strongly rely on encoder-based state embeddings, our framework decouples the network design, simplifying the policy network and deployment. A high performance teacher policy is first trained using privileged information to acquire generalizable motion skills. The teacher's motion distribution is transferred to the student policy, which relies only on noisy proprioceptive data, via a generative adversarial mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by distributional shifts. Additionally, auxiliary task learning enhances the student policy's feature representation, speeding up convergence and improving adaptability to varying terrains. The framework is validated on a humanoid robot, showing a great improvement in locomotion stability on dynamic terrains and significant reductions in development costs. This work provides a practical solution for deploying robust locomotion strategies in humanoid robots.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific equation discovery is a fundamental task in the history of scientific progress, enabling the derivation of laws governing natural phenomena. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained interest for this task due to their potential to leverage embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, evaluating the true discovery capabilities of these methods remains challenging, as existing benchmarks often rely on common equations that are susceptible to memorization by LLMs, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect discovery. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SRBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 239 challenging problems across four scientific domains specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based scientific equation discovery methods while preventing trivial memorization. Our benchmark comprises two main categories: LSR-Transform, which transforms common physical models into less common mathematical representations to test reasoning beyond memorized forms, and LSR-Synth, which introduces synthetic, discovery-driven problems requiring data-driven reasoning. Through extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods, using both open and closed LLMs, we find that the best-performing system so far achieves only 31.5% symbolic accuracy. These findings highlight the challenges of scientific equation discovery, positioning LLM-SRBench as a valuable resource for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Yi, Jake Lever, Kevin Bryson, Zaiqiao Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an effective approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by modifying their internal knowledge. However, their application to the biomedical domain faces unique challenges due to the long-tailed distribution of biomedical knowledge, where rare and infrequent information is prevalent. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to investigate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods for editing long-tail biomedical knowledge. Our results indicate that, while existing editing methods can enhance LLMs' performance on long-tail biomedical knowledge, their performance on long-tail knowledge remains inferior to that on high-frequency popular knowledge, even after editing. Our further analysis reveals that long-tail biomedical knowledge contains a significant amount of one-to-many knowledge, where one subject and relation link to multiple objects. This high prevalence of one-to-many knowledge limits the effectiveness of knowledge editing in improving LLMs' understanding of long-tail biomedical knowledge, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to bridge this performance gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled them to approach human-level persuasion capabilities. However, such potential also raises concerns about the safety risks of LLM-driven persuasion, particularly their potential for unethical influence through manipulation, deception, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and many other harmful tactics. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of LLM persuasion safety through two critical aspects: (1) whether LLMs appropriately reject unethical persuasion tasks and avoid unethical strategies during execution, including cases where the initial persuasion goal appears ethically neutral, and (2) how influencing factors like personality traits and external pressures affect their behavior. To this end, we introduce PersuSafety, the first comprehensive framework for the assessment of persuasion safety which consists of three stages, i.e., persuasion scene creation, persuasive conversation simulation, and persuasion safety assessment. PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and 15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including failing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical persuasion strategies. Our study calls for more attention to improve safety alignment in progressive and goal-driven conversations such as persuasion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in video understanding. However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC). Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding. Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Dang, Christina Baek, Kaiyue Wen, Zico Kolter, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades-off between bias and variance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predict+Optimize frameworks integrate forecasting and optimization to address real-world challenges such as renewable energy scheduling, where variability and uncertainty are critical factors. This paper benchmarks solutions from the IEEE-CIS Technical Challenge on Predict+Optimize for Renewable Energy Scheduling, focusing on forecasting renewable production and demand and optimizing energy cost. The competition attracted 49 participants in total. The top-ranked method employed stochastic optimization using LightGBM ensembles, and achieved at least a 2% reduction in energy costs compared to deterministic approaches, demonstrating that the most accurate point forecast does not necessarily guarantee the best performance in downstream optimization. The published data and problem setting establish a benchmark for further research into integrated forecasting-optimization methods for energy systems, highlighting the importance of considering forecast uncertainty in optimization models to achieve cost-effective and reliable energy management. The novelty of this work lies in its comprehensive evaluation of Predict+Optimize methodologies applied to a real-world renewable energy scheduling problem, providing insights into the scalability, generalizability, and effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Potential applications extend beyond energy systems to any domain requiring integrated forecasting and optimization, such as supply chain management, transportation planning, and financial portfolio optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyu Wang, Guilin Qi, Jiaoyan Chen, Yi Huang, Tianxing Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ontologies contain rich knowledge within domain, which can be divided into two categories, namely extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge. Extensional knowledge provides information about the concrete instances that belong to specific concepts in the ontology, while intensional knowledge details inherent properties, characteristics, and semantic associations among concepts. However, existing ontology embedding approaches fail to take both extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge into fine consideration simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology embedding approach named EIKE (Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding) by representing ontologies in two spaces, called extensional space and intensional space. EIKE presents a unified framework for embedding instances, concepts and their relations in an ontology, applying a geometry-based method to model extensional knowledge and a pretrained language model to model intensional knowledge, which can capture both structure information and textual information. Experimental results show that EIKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three datasets for both triple classification and link prediction, indicating that EIKE provides a more comprehensive and representative perspective of the domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Mikhail Baranchuk, Martin Strohmeier, Vijay Bolina, Philip H. S. Torr, Lewis Hammond, Christian Schroeder de Witt</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Marzari, Priya L. Donti, Changliu Liu, Enrico Marchesini</p>
<p>Abstract: We present $\varepsilon$-retrain, an exploration strategy encouraging a behavioral preference while optimizing policies with monotonic improvement guarantees. To this end, we introduce an iterative procedure for collecting retrain areas -- parts of the state space where an agent did not satisfy the behavioral preference. Our method switches between the typical uniform restart state distribution and the retrain areas using a decaying factor $\varepsilon$, allowing agents to retrain on situations where they violated the preference. We also employ formal verification of neural networks to provably quantify the degree to which agents adhere to these behavioral preferences. Experiments over hundreds of seeds across locomotion, power network, and navigation tasks show that our method yields agents that exhibit significant performance and sample efficiency improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyun Qiao, Kathryn A McGurk, Shuo Wang, Paul M. Matthews, Declan P O Regan, Wenjia Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the structure and motion of the heart is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of global death. There is wide variation in cardiac shape and motion patterns, that are influenced by demographic, anthropometric and disease factors. Unravelling the normal patterns of shape and motion, as well as understanding how each individual deviates from the norm, would facilitate accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment strategies. To this end, we developed a novel conditional generative model, MeshHeart, to learn the distribution of cardiac shape and motion patterns. MeshHeart is capable of generating 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences, taking into account clinical factors such as age, sex, weight and height. To model the high-dimensional and complex spatio-temporal mesh data, MeshHeart employs a geometric encoder to represent cardiac meshes in a latent space, followed by a temporal Transformer to model the motion dynamics of latent representations. Based on MeshHeart, we investigate the latent space of 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences and propose a novel distance metric termed latent delta, which quantifies the deviation of a real heart from its personalised normative pattern in the latent space. In experiments using a large dataset of 38,309 subjects, MeshHeart demonstrates a high performance in cardiac mesh sequence reconstruction and generation. Features defined in the latent space are highly discriminative for cardiac disease classification, whereas the latent delta exhibits strong correlation with clinical phenotypes in phenome-wide association studies. The codes and models of this study will be released to benefit further research on digital heart modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele De Vito, Filomena Ferrucci, Athanasios Angelakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Medication errors significantly threaten patient safety, leading to adverse drug events and substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) aimed at mitigating these errors often face limitations when processing unstructured clinical data, including reliance on static databases and rule-based algorithms, frequently generating excessive alerts that lead to alert fatigue among healthcare providers. This paper introduces HELIOT, an innovative CDSS for adverse drug reaction management that processes free-text clinical information using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with a comprehensive pharmaceutical data repository. HELIOT leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities to interpret medical narratives, extract relevant drug reaction information from unstructured clinical notes, and learn from past patient-specific medication tolerances to reduce false alerts, enabling more nuanced and contextual adverse drug event warnings across primary care, specialist consultations, and hospital settings. An initial evaluation using a synthetic dataset of clinical narratives and expert-verified ground truth shows promising results. HELIOT achieves high accuracy in a controlled setting. In addition, by intelligently analyzing previous medication tolerance documented in clinical notes and distinguishing between cases requiring different alert types, HELIOT can potentially reduce interruptive alerts by over 50% compared to traditional CDSSs. While these preliminary findings are encouraging, real-world validation will be essential to confirm these benefits in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, defined by its ubiquitous yet irreplaceable role in human activities ranging from routine tasks to civil engineering. Embedding machines with mechanical reasoning is therefore an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, we leveraged 155 cognitive experiments to test the understanding of system stability, gears and pulley systems, leverage principle, inertia and motion, and fluid mechanics in 26 Vision Language Models (VLMs). Results indicate that VLMs consistently perform worse than humans on all domains, while demonstrate significant difficulty in reasoning about gear systems and fluid mechanics. Notably, their performance on these tasks do not improve as number of parameters increase, suggesting that current attention-based architecture may fail to grasp certain underlying mechanisms required for mechanical reasoning, particularly those pertaining to mental simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingying Gao, Yijiang Li, Haiyun Lyu, Haoran Sun, Dezhi Luo, Hokin Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowing others' intentions and taking others' perspectives are two core components of human intelligence that are considered to be instantiations of theory-of-mind. Infiltrating machines with these abilities is an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, to investigate intentionality understanding and level-2 perspective-taking in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we constructed the IntentBench and PerspectBench, which together contains over 300 cognitive experiments grounded in real-world scenarios and classic cognitive tasks. We found VLMs achieving high performance on intentionality understanding but low performance on level-2 perspective-taking. This suggests a potential dissociation between simulation-based and theory-based theory-of-mind abilities in VLMs, highlighting the concern that they are not capable of using model-based reasoning to infer others' mental states.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dezhi Luo, Haiyun Lyu, Qingying Gao, Haoran Sun, Yijiang Li, Hokin Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding law of conservation is a critical milestone in human cognitive development considered to be supported by the apprehension of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we have curated the ConserveBench, a battery of 365 cognitive experiments across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve transformational tasks which require reversibility understanding. The latter two involve non-transformational tasks which assess quantity understanding. Surprisingly, we find that while Vision Language Models are generally good at transformational tasks, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks. There is a dissociation between understanding the reversibility of operations and understanding the concept of quantity, which both are believed to be the cornerstones of understanding law of conservation in humans. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/}{Website}$</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushang Karia, Daniel Bramblett, Daksh Dobhal, Siddharth Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents AutoEval, a novel benchmark for scaling Large Language Model (LLM) assessment in formal tasks with clear notions of correctness, such as truth maintenance in translation and logical reasoning. AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Yu, Yuhong Wang, Wei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Bus holding control is a widely-adopted strategy for maintaining stability and improving the operational efficiency of bus systems. Traditional model-based methods often face challenges with the low accuracy of bus state prediction and passenger demand estimation. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a data-driven approach, has demonstrated great potential in formulating bus holding strategies. RL determines the optimal control strategies in order to maximize the cumulative reward, which reflects the overall control goals. However, translating sparse and delayed control goals in real-world tasks into dense and real-time rewards for RL is challenging, normally requiring extensive manual trial-and-error. In view of this, this study introduces an automatic reward generation paradigm by leveraging the in-context learning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This new paradigm, termed the LLM-enhanced RL, comprises several LLM-based modules: reward initializer, reward modifier, performance analyzer, and reward refiner. These modules cooperate to initialize and iteratively improve the reward function according to the feedback from training and test results for the specified RL-based task. Ineffective reward functions generated by the LLM are filtered out to ensure the stable evolution of the RL agents' performance over iterations. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed LLM-enhanced RL paradigm, it is applied to extensive bus holding control scenarios that vary in the number of bus lines, stops, and passenger demand. The results demonstrate the superiority, generalization capability, and robustness of the proposed paradigm compared to vanilla RL strategies, the LLM-based controller, physics-based feedback controllers, and optimization-based controllers. This study sheds light on the great potential of utilizing LLMs in various smart mobility applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'it R\r{u}\v{z}i\v{c}ka, Andrew Markham</p>
<p>Abstract: On-board processing of hyperspectral data with machine learning models would enable unprecedented amount of autonomy for a wide range of tasks, for example methane detection or mineral identification. This can enable early warning system and could allow new capabilities such as automated scheduling across constellations of satellites. Classical methods suffer from high false positive rates and previous deep learning models exhibit prohibitive computational requirements. We propose fast and accurate machine learning architectures which support end-to-end training with data of high spectral dimension without relying on hand-crafted products or spectral band compression preprocessing. We evaluate our models on two tasks related to hyperspectral data processing. With our proposed general architectures, we improve the F1 score of the previous methane detection state-of-the-art models by 27% on a newly created synthetic dataset and by 13% on the previously released large benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate that training models on the synthetic dataset improves performance of models finetuned on the dataset of real events by 6.9% in F1 score in contrast with training from scratch. On a newly created dataset for mineral identification, our models provide 3.5% improvement in the F1 score in contrast to the default versions of the models. With our proposed models we improve the inference speed by 85% in contrast to previous classical and deep learning approaches by removing the dependency on classically computed features. With our architecture, one capture from the EMIT sensor can be processed within 30 seconds on realistic proxy of the ION-SCV 004 satellite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Rismanchian, Yasaman Razeghi, Sameer Singh, Shayan Doroudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have the ability to reason about geometric patterns in images and scenes from a young age. However, developing large multimodal models (LMMs) capable of similar reasoning remains a challenge, highlighting the need for robust evaluation methods to assess these capabilities. We introduce \Turtle, a benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs' capacity to interpret geometric patterns -- given visual examples, textual instructions, or both -- and generate precise code outputs. Inspired by turtle geometry, a notion used to teach children foundational coding and geometric concepts, TurtleBench features tasks with patterned shapes that have underlying algorithmic logic. Our evaluation reveals that leading LMMs struggle significantly with these tasks, with GPT-4o achieving only 19\% accuracy on the simplest tasks and few-shot prompting only marginally improves their performance ($<2\%$). \Turtle highlights the gap between human and AI performance in intuitive and visual geometrical understanding, setting the stage for future research in this area. \Turtle stands as one of the few benchmarks to evaluate the integration of visual understanding and code generation capabilities in LMMs, setting the stage for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kee Siong Ng, Samuel Yang-Zhao, Timothy Cadogan-Cowper</p>
<p>Abstract: The AI safety literature is full of examples of powerful AI agents that, in blindly pursuing a specific and usually narrow objective, ends up with unacceptable and even catastrophic collateral damage to others. In this paper, we consider the problem of social harms that can result from actions taken by learning and utility-maximising agents in a multi-agent environment. The problem of measuring social harms or impacts in such multi-agent settings, especially when the agents are artificial generally intelligent (AGI) agents, was listed as an open problem in Everitt et al, 2018. We attempt a partial answer to that open problem in the form of market-based mechanisms to quantify and control the cost of such social harms. The proposed setup captures many well-studied special cases and is more general than existing formulations of multi-agent reinforcement learning with mechanism design in two ways: (i) the underlying environment is a history-based general reinforcement learning environment like in AIXI; (ii) the reinforcement-learning agents participating in the environment can have different learning strategies and planning horizons. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed setup, we survey some key classes of learning algorithms and present a few applications, including a discussion of the Paperclips problem and pollution control with a cap-and-trade system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Jiang, Yangyang Zhuang, Chenxi Song, Xu Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Chi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</p>

Students can frequently interact with LLM-powered, interactive learning tools, but their usage patterns need to be analyzed to ensure ethical usage of these tools. To better understand how students interact with LLMs in an academic setting, we introduce \textbf{StudyChat}, a publicly available dataset capturing real-world student interactions with an LLM-powered tutoring chatbot in a semester-long, university-level artificial intelligence (AI) course. We deploy a web application that replicates ChatGPT's core functionalities, and use it to log student interactions with the LLM while working on programming assignments. We collect 1,197 conversations, which we annotate using a dialogue act labeling schema inspired by observed interaction patterns and prior research. Additionally, we analyze these interactions, highlight behavioral trends, and analyze how specific usage patterns relate to course outcomes. \textbf{StudyChat} provides a rich resource for the learning sciences and AI in education communities, enabling further research into the evolving role of LLMs in education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 use enhanced reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Their potential in hardware design, which relies on expert-driven iterative optimization, remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether reasoning LLMs can address challenges in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration and optimization. During HLS, engineers manually define pragmas/directives to balance performance and resource constraints. We propose an LLM-based optimization agentic framework that automatically restructures code, inserts pragmas, and identifies optimal design points via feedback from HLs tools and access to integer-linear programming (ILP) solvers. Experiments compare reasoning models against conventional LLMs on benchmarks using success rate, efficiency, and design quality (area/latency) metrics, and provide the first-ever glimpse into the CoTs produced by a powerful open-source reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models offers new possibilities for structured exploration of scientific knowledge. Rather than viewing scientific discovery as isolated ideas or content, we propose a structured approach that emphasizes the role of method combinations in shaping disruptive insights. Specifically, we investigate how knowledge unit--especially those tied to methodological design--can be modeled and recombined to yield research breakthroughs. Our proposed framework addresses two key challenges. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based mechanism to identify distinguishing features of historically disruptive method combinations within problem-driven contexts. Second, we propose a reasoning-guided Monte Carlo search algorithm that leverages the chain-of-thought capability of LLMs to identify promising knowledge recombinations for new problem statements.Empirical studies across multiple domains show that the framework is capable of modeling the structural dynamics of innovation and successfully highlights combinations with high disruptive potential. This research provides a new path for computationally guided scientific ideation grounded in structured reasoning and historical data modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. Meanwhile, as we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we carry a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej \v{S}progar</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anja Surina, Amin Mansouri, Lars Quaedvlieg, Amal Seddas, Maryna Viazovska, Emmanuel Abbe, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for multi-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a structured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we propose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input, output, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through case studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we demonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more interpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference implementation of the core TME components is available at https://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and structured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a tree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable substeps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the groundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M Quamer Nasim, Tannistha Maiti, Ayush Srivastava, Tarry Singh, Jie Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn accurately from large quantities of labeled input data, but often fail to do so when labelled data are scarce. DNNs sometimes fail to generalize ontest data sampled from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)techniques have been proven useful when no labels are available, and when distribution shifts are observed in the target domain (TD). In the present study, experiments are performed on seismic images of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. A deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images when few classes have data scarcity, and we use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy >84% and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduce the CORAL (Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections from F3 and Penobscot, to demonstrate possible approaches when labelled data are unavailable. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of Penobscot, with an overall accuracy>50%. Taken together, the EAN-DDA has the potential to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristina Garbacea, Qiaozhu Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural language models combined with the capacity of large scale datasets have accelerated the development of natural language generation systems that produce fluent and coherent texts (to various degrees of success) in a multitude of tasks and application contexts. However, controlling the output of these models for desired user and task needs is still an open challenge. This is crucial not only to customizing the content and style of the generated language, but also to their safe and reliable deployment in the real world. We present an extensive survey on the emerging topic of constrained neural language generation in which we formally define and categorize the problems of natural language generation by distinguishing between conditions and constraints (the latter being testable conditions on the output text instead of the input), present constrained text generation tasks, and review existing methods and evaluation metrics for constrained text generation. Our aim is to highlight recent progress and trends in this emerging field, informing on the most promising directions and limitations towards advancing the state-of-the-art of constrained neural language generation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Leo Yan Li-Han, Hua Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: The clinical diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) typically involves manually measuring key radiological angles -- Center-Edge (CE), Tonnis, and Sharp angles -- from pelvic radiographs, a process that is time-consuming and susceptible to variability. This study aims to develop an automated system that integrates these measurements to enhance the accuracy and consistency of DDH diagnosis.
  Methods and procedures: We developed an end-to-end deep learning model for keypoint detection that accurately identifies eight anatomical keypoints from pelvic radiographs, enabling the automated calculation of CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles. To support the diagnostic decision, we introduced a novel data-driven scoring system that combines the information from all three angles into a comprehensive and explainable diagnostic output.
  Results: The system demonstrated superior consistency in angle measurements compared to a cohort of eight moderately experienced orthopedists. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the CE, Tonnis, and Sharp angles were 0.957 (95% CI: 0.952--0.962), 0.942 (95% CI: 0.937--0.947), and 0.966 (95% CI: 0.964--0.968), respectively. The system achieved a diagnostic F1 score of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.851--0.876), significantly outperforming the orthopedist group (0.777, 95% CI: 0.737--0.817, p = 0.005), as well as using clinical diagnostic criteria for each angle individually (p<0.001).
  Conclusion: The proposed system provides reliable and consistent automated measurements of radiological angles and an explainable diagnostic output for DDH, outperforming moderately experienced clinicians.
  Clinical impact: This AI-powered solution reduces the variability and potential errors of manual measurements, offering clinicians a more consistent and interpretable tool for DDH diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Shevtsov, Despoina Antonakaki, Ioannis Lamprou, Polyvios Pratikakis, Sotiris Ioannidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Twitter, as one of the most popular social networks, provides a platform for communication and online discourse. Unfortunately, it has also become a target for bots and fake accounts, resulting in the spread of false information and manipulation. This paper introduces a semi-automatic machine learning pipeline (SAMLP) designed to address the challenges associated with machine learning model development. Through this pipeline, we develop a comprehensive bot detection model named BotArtist, based on user profile features. SAMLP leverages nine distinct publicly available datasets to train the BotArtist model. To assess BotArtist's performance against current state-of-the-art solutions, we evaluate 35 existing Twitter bot detection methods, each utilizing a diverse range of features. Our comparative evaluation of BotArtist and these existing methods, conducted across nine public datasets under standardized conditions, reveals that the proposed model outperforms existing solutions by almost 10% in terms of F1-score, achieving an average score of 83.19% and 68.5% over specific and general approaches, respectively. As a result of this research, we provide one of the largest labeled Twitter bot datasets. The dataset contains extracted features combined with BotArtist predictions for 10,929,533 Twitter user profiles, collected via Twitter API during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War over a 16-month period. This dataset was created based on [Shevtsov et al., 2022a] where the original authors share anonymized tweets discussing the Russo-Ukrainian war, totaling 127,275,386 tweets. The combination of the existing textual dataset and the provided labeled bot and human profiles will enable future development of more advanced bot detection large language models in the post-Twitter API era.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions and performance metrics in deep learning, highlighting key developments and practical insights across diverse application areas. We begin by outlining fundamental considerations in classic tasks such as regression and classification, then extend our analysis to specialized domains like computer vision and natural language processing including retrieval-augmented generation. In each setting, we systematically examine how different loss functions and evaluation metrics can be paired to address task-specific challenges such as class imbalance, outliers, and sequence-level optimization. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a unified framework for understanding how losses and metrics align with different learning objectives, (2) an in-depth discussion of multi-loss setups that balance competing goals, and (3) new insights into specialized metrics used to evaluate modern applications like retrieval-augmented generation, where faithfulness and context relevance are pivotal. Along the way, we highlight best practices for selecting or combining losses and metrics based on empirical behaviors and domain constraints. Finally, we identify open problems and promising directions, including the automation of loss-function search and the development of robust, interpretable evaluation measures for increasingly complex deep learning tasks. Our review aims to equip researchers and practitioners with clearer guidance in designing effective training pipelines and reliable model assessments for a wide spectrum of real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Wu, Mingdong Wu, Jiyao Zhang, Yunchong Gan, Hao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of anthropomorphic robotic hands for assisting individuals in situations where human hands may be unavailable or unsuitable has gained significant importance. In this paper, we propose a novel task called human-assisting dexterous grasping that aims to train a policy for controlling a robotic hand's fingers to assist users in grasping objects. Unlike conventional dexterous grasping, this task presents a more complex challenge as the policy needs to adapt to diverse user intentions, in addition to the object's geometry. We address this challenge by proposing an approach consisting of two sub-modules: a hand-object-conditional grasping primitive called Grasping Gradient Field~(GraspGF), and a history-conditional residual policy. GraspGF learns `how' to grasp by estimating the gradient from a success grasping example set, while the residual policy determines `when' and at what speed the grasping action should be executed based on the trajectory history. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to baselines, highlighting the user-awareness and practicality in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. M. Fazle Rabby Labib, Joyanta Jyoti Mondal, Meem Arafat Manab, Xi Xiao, Sarfaraz Newaz</p>
<p>Abstract: The susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks undermines their reliability across numerous applications, underscoring the necessity for an in-depth exploration of these vulnerabilities and the formulation of robust defense strategies. The DeepFool algorithm by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2016) represents a pivotal step in identifying minimal perturbations required to induce misclassification of input images. Nonetheless, its generic methodology falls short in scenarios necessitating targeted interventions. Additionally, previous research studies have predominantly concentrated on the success rate of attacks without adequately addressing the consequential distortion of images, the maintenance of image quality, or the confidence threshold required for misclassification. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the Enhanced Targeted DeepFool (ET DeepFool) algorithm, an evolution of DeepFool that not only facilitates the specification of desired misclassification targets but also incorporates a configurable minimum confidence score. Our empirical investigations demonstrate the superiority of this refined approach in maintaining the integrity of images and minimizing perturbations across a variety of DNN architectures. Unlike previous iterations, such as the Targeted DeepFool by Gajjar et al. (2022), our method grants unparalleled control over the perturbation process, enabling precise manipulation of model responses. Preliminary outcomes reveal that certain models, including AlexNet and the advanced Vision Transformer, display commendable robustness to such manipulations. This discovery of varying levels of model robustness, as unveiled through our confidence level adjustments, could have far-reaching implications for the field of image recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Ahmed Jamal</p>
<p>Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are fast emerging sensors in the field of Earth Observation. It is a remote sensing technology that utilizes laser beams to measure distances and create detailed three-dimensional representations of objects and environments. The potential of Full Waveform LiDAR is much greater than just height estimation and 3D reconstruction only. Overall shape of signal provides important information about properties of water body. However, the shape of FWL is unexplored as most LiDAR software work on point cloud by utilizing the maximum value within the waveform. Existing techniques in the field of LiDAR data analysis include depth estimation through inverse modeling and regression of logarithmic intensity and depth for approximating the attenuation coefficient. However, these methods suffer from limitations in accuracy. Depth estimation through inverse modeling provides only approximate values and does not account for variations in surface properties, while the regression approach for the attenuation coefficient is only able to generalize a value through several data points which lacks precision and may lead to significant errors in estimation. Additionally, there is currently no established modeling method available for predicting bottom reflectance. This research proposed a novel solution based on neural networks for parameter estimation in LIDAR data analysis. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed solution successfully learned the inversion model, was able to do prediction of parameters such as depth, attenuation coefficient, and bottom reflectance. Performance of model was validated by testing it on real LiDAR data. In future, more data availability would enable more accuracy and reliability of such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Yongji Wu, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Atul Prakash, Matthew Lentz, Danyang Zhuo, Feng Qian, Z. Morley Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Qiao, Wei Zhou, Junhao Wen, Chen Gao, Qun Luo, Peixuan Chen, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) methods often rely on user behavior data, which can struggle with the sparsity of session data, limiting performance. Researchers have identified that beyond behavioral signals, rich semantic information in item descriptions is crucial for capturing hidden user intent. While large language models (LLMs) offer new ways to leverage this semantic data, the challenges of session anonymity, short-sequence nature, and high LLM training costs have hindered the development of a lightweight, efficient LLM framework for SBR.
  To address the above challenges, we propose an LLM-enhanced SBR framework that integrates semantic and behavioral signals from multiple views. This two-stage framework leverages the strengths of both LLMs and traditional SBR models while minimizing training costs. In the first stage, we use multi-view prompts to infer latent user intentions at the session semantic level, supported by an intent localization module to alleviate LLM hallucinations. In the second stage, we align and unify these semantic inferences with behavioral representations, effectively merging insights from both large and small models. Extensive experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that the LLM4SBR framework can effectively improve model performance. We release our codes along with the baselines at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM4SBR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical predictor of psychotherapy success. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze session transcripts and map them to distributed representations. These representations capture the semantic similarities between the dialogues and psychometric instruments, such as the Working Alliance Inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions spanning diverse psychiatric conditions -- including anxiety (N=498), depression (N=377), schizophrenia (N=71), and suicidal tendencies (N=12) -- collected between 1970 and 2012, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories, offering interpretable insights for clinical practice, and identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and how these topics evolve during each turn of the conversation. This integrated framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enables timely feedback for therapists on the quality of therapeutic relationships, and provides clear, actionable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mitigating hallucination issues is a key challenge that must be overcome to reliably deploy large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. Recently, various methods have been proposed to detect and revise factual errors in LLM-generated texts, in order to reduce hallucination. In this paper, we propose Re-Ex, a method for post-editing LLM-generated responses. Re-Ex introduces a novel reasoning step dubbed as the factual error explanation step. Re-Ex revises the initial response of LLMs using 3-steps : first, external tools are used to retrieve the evidences of the factual errors in the initial LLM response; next, LLM is instructed to explain the problematic parts of the response based on the gathered evidence; finally, LLM revises the initial response using the explanations provided in the previous step. In addition to the explanation step, Re-Ex also incorporates new prompting techniques to reduce the token count and inference time required for the response revision process. Compared with existing methods including FacTool, CoVE, and RARR, Re-Ex provides better detection and revision performance with less inference time and fewer tokens in multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Liu, Yuhan Fu, Ruobing Xie, Runquan Xie, Xingwu Sun, Fengzong Lian, Zhanhui Kang, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hallucinate, resulting in an emerging topic of visual hallucination evaluation (VHE). This paper contributes a ChatGPT-Prompted visual hallucination evaluation Dataset (PhD) for objective VHE at a large scale. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with specious context (PhD-sec) or with incorrect context ({PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, specious / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadi Alyahya, Abeer Aldayel</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining the factors that the counterspeech uses are at the core of understanding the optimal methods for confronting hate speech online. Various studies have assessed the emotional base factors used in counter speech, such as emotional empathy, offensiveness, and hostility. To better understand the counterspeech used in conversations, this study distills persuasion modes into reason, emotion, and credibility and evaluates their use in two types of conversation interactions: closed (multi-turn) and open (single-turn) concerning racism, sexism, and religious bigotry. The evaluation covers the distinct behaviors seen with human-sourced as opposed to machine-generated counterspeech. It also assesses the interplay between the stance taken and the mode of persuasion seen in the counterspeech.
  Notably, we observe nuanced differences in the counterspeech persuasion modes used in open and closed interactions, especially in terms of the topic, with a general tendency to use reason as a persuasion mode to express the counterpoint to hate comments. The machine-generated counterspeech tends to exhibit an emotional persuasion mode, while human counters lean toward reason. Furthermore, our study shows that reason tends to obtain more supportive replies than other persuasion modes. The findings highlight the potential for incorporating persuasion modes into studies about countering hate speech, as they can serve as an optimal means of explainability and pave the way for the further adoption of the reply's stance and the role it plays in assessing what comprises the optimal counterspeech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingzhi Li, Junyu Liu, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating & reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Marius Lillelund, Fernando Pannullo, Morten Opprud Jakobsen, Manuel Morante, Christian Fischer Pedersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of ball bearings is an active area of research, where novel machine learning techniques are continuously being applied to predict degradation trends and anticipate failures before they occur. However, few studies have explicitly addressed the challenge of handling censored data, where information about a specific event (\eg mechanical failure) is incomplete or only partially observed. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and flexible method for early fault detection using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and RUL estimation using survival analysis that naturally supports censored data. We demonstrate our approach in the XJTU-SY dataset using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy across three different operating conditions. When predicting the time to failure for bearings under the highest load (C1, 12.0 kN and 2100 RPM) with 25% random censoring, our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.7 minutes (95% CI = 13.6-15.8) using a linear CoxPH model, and an MAE of 12.6 minutes (95% CI = 11.8-13.4) using a nonlinear Random Survival Forests model, compared to an MAE of 18.5 minutes (95% CI = 17.4-19.6) using a linear LASSO model that does not support censoring. Moreover, our approach achieves a mean cumulative relative accuracy (CRA) of 0.7586 over 5 bearings under the highest load, which improves over several state-of-the-art baselines. Our work highlights the importance of considering censored data as part of the model design when building predictive models for early fault detection and RUL estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alvaro Gomariz, Yusuke Kikuchi, Yun Yvonna Li, Thomas Albrecht, Andreas Maunz, Daniela Ferrara, Huanxiang Lu, Orcun Goksel</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their effectiveness, current deep learning models face challenges with images coming from different domains with varying appearance and content. We introduce SegCLR, a versatile framework designed to segment images across different domains, employing supervised and contrastive learning simultaneously to effectively learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. We demonstrate the superior performance of SegCLR through a comprehensive evaluation involving three diverse clinical datasets of 3D retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, for the slice-wise segmentation of fluids with various network configurations and verification across 10 different network initializations. In an unsupervised domain adaptation context, SegCLR achieves results on par with a supervised upper-bound model trained on the intended target domain. Notably, we discover that the segmentation performance of SegCLR framework is marginally impacted by the abundance of unlabeled data from the target domain, thereby we also propose an effective domain generalization extension of SegCLR, known also as zero-shot domain adaptation, which eliminates the need for any target domain information. This shows that our proposed addition of contrastive loss in standard supervised training for segmentation leads to superior models, inherently more generalizable to both in- and out-of-domain test data. We additionally propose a pragmatic solution for SegCLR deployment in realistic scenarios with multiple domains containing labeled data. Accordingly, our framework pushes the boundaries of deep-learning based segmentation in multi-domain applications, regardless of data availability - labeled, unlabeled, or nonexistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichao Hu, Junyi Jessy Li, Arjun Guha, Joydeep Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Choi, Arash Ahmadian, Matthieu Geist, Oilvier Pietquin, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar</p>
<p>Abstract: Online and offline RLHF methods, such as PPO and DPO, have been highly successful in aligning AI with human preferences. Despite their success, however, these methods suffer from fundamental limitations: (a) Models trained with RLHF can learn from mistakes or negative examples through RL mechanism or contrastive loss during training. However, at inference time, they lack an innate self-improvement mechanism for error corrections. (b) The optimal solution of existing methods is highly task-dependent, making it difficult for them to generalize to new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization (SRPO), a practical and mathematically principled offline RLHF framework. The key idea behind SRPO is to cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement process, mathematically formulated as a min-max objective that jointly optimizes a self-improvement policy and a generative policy in an adversarial fashion. Crucially, the solution for this optimization problem is independent of the training task, which makes it robust to its changes. We then show that this objective can be reformulated as a non-adversarial offline loss, which can be efficiently optimized using standard supervised learning techniques at scale. To demonstrate SRPO's effectiveness, we evaluate it using AI Win-Rate (WR) against human (GOLD) completions. When tested on the XSum dataset, SRPO outperforms DPO by a margin of 15% after 5 self revisions, achieving an impressive 90% WR. Moreover, on the challenging Arena-Hard prompts, SRPO outperforms both DPO and IPO (by 4% without revision and 6% after a single revision), reaching a 56% WR against against Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Zhang, Maolin Wang, Wanyu Wang, Jingtong Gao, Xiangyu Zhao, Yu Yang, Xuetao Wei, Zitao Liu, Tong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained significant traction in sequential recommender systems (SRSs) for their ability to capture user-item interactions effectively. However, these models often suffer from high computational costs and slow inference. Meanwhile, existing efficient SRS approaches struggle to embed high-quality semantic and positional information into latent representations. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces GLINT-RU, a lightweight and efficient SRS leveraging a single-layer dense selective Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) module to accelerate inference. By incorporating a dense selective gate, GLINT-RU adaptively captures temporal dependencies and fine-grained positional information, generating high-quality latent representations. Additionally, a parallel mixing block infuses fine-grained positional features into user-item interactions, enhancing both recommendation quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GLINT-RU achieves superior prediction accuracy and inference speed, outperforming baselines based on RNNs, Transformers, MLPs, and SSMs. These results establish GLINT-RU as a powerful and efficient solution for SRSs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Zhong, Liman Wang, Wenting Cao, Zeyuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. When properly balanced, we show that certain cognitive biases can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rotem Shalev-Arkushin, Aharon Azulay, Tavi Halperin, Eitan Richardson, Amit H. Bermano, Ohad Fried</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown remarkable image and video editing capabilities. However, local video editing, particularly removal of small attributes like glasses, remains a challenge. Existing methods either alter the videos excessively, generate unrealistic artifacts, or fail to perform the requested edit consistently throughout the video. In this work, we focus on consistent and identity-preserving removal of glasses in videos, using it as a case study for consistent local attribute removal in videos. Due to the lack of paired data, we adopt a weakly supervised approach and generate synthetic imperfect data, using an adjusted pretrained diffusion model. We show that despite data imperfection, by learning from our generated data and leveraging the prior of pretrained diffusion models, our model is able to perform the desired edit consistently while preserving the original video content. Furthermore, we exemplify the generalization ability of our method to other local video editing tasks by applying it successfully to facial sticker-removal. Our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, showcasing the potential of leveraging synthetic data and strong video priors for local video editing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angeline Aguinaldo, Evan Patterson, William Regli</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to ontology-based robot plan transfer by leveraging functorial data migrations, a structured mapping method derived from category theory. Functors provide structured maps between planning domain ontologies which enables the transfer of task plans without the need for replanning. Unlike methods tailored to specific plans, our framework applies universally within the source domain once a structured map is defined. We demonstrate this approach by transferring a task plan from the canonical Blocksworld domain to one compatible with the AI2-THOR Kitchen environment. Additionally, we discuss practical limitations, propose benchmarks for evaluating symbolic plan transfer methods, and outline future directions for scaling this approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Payel Sadhukhan, Tanujit Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across government and private industries brings both advancements and heightened privacy and security concerns. Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates the Right to Erasure, requiring data to be permanently removed from a system to prevent potential compromise. While existing research primarily focuses on erasing sensitive data attributes, several passive data compromise mechanisms remain underexplored and unaddressed. One such issue arises from the residual footprints of training data embedded within predictive models. Performance disparities between test and training data can inadvertently reveal which data points were part of the training set, posing a privacy risk. This study examines how two fundamental aspects of classifier systems - training data quality and classifier training methodology - contribute to privacy vulnerabilities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that classifiers exhibit universal vulnerability under conditions of data imbalance and distributional shifts. Empirical findings reinforce our theoretical results, highlighting the significant role of training data quality in classifier susceptibility. Additionally, our study reveals that a classifier's operational mechanism and architectural design impact its vulnerability. We further investigate mitigation strategies through data obfuscation techniques and analyze their impact on both privacy and classification performance. To aid practitioners, we introduce a privacy-performance trade-off index, providing a structured approach to balancing privacy protection with model effectiveness. The findings offer valuable insights for selecting classifiers and curating training data in diverse real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel preprocessing and prediction pipeline for the classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that takes advantage of the information rich complex valued k-Space. Using a publicly available MRI raw dataset with 312 subject and a total of 9508 slices, we show the advantage of utilizing the k-Space for better prostate cancer likelihood estimation in comparison to just using the magnitudinal information in the image domain, with an AUROC of $86.1\%\pm1.8\%$. Additionally, by using high undersampling rates and a simple principal component analysis (PCA) for coil compression, we reduce the time needed for reconstruction by avoiding the time intensive GRAPPA reconstruction algorithm. By using digital undersampling for our experiments, we show that scanning and reconstruction time could be reduced. Even with an undersampling factor of 16, our approach achieves meaningful results, with an AUROC of $71.4\%\pm2.9\%$, using the PCA coil combination and taking into account the k-Space information. With this study, we were able to show the feasibility of preserving phase and k-Space information, with consistent results. Besides preserving valuable information for further diagnostics, this approach can work without the time intensive ADC and reconstruction calculations, greatly reducing the post processing, as well as potential scanning time, increasing patient comfort and allowing a close to real-time prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandra C. Matz, Heinrich Peters, Moran Cerf, Eric Grunenberg, Paul W. Eastwick, Mitja D. Back, Eli J. Finkel</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) models become an integral part of everyday life, our interactions with them shift from purely functional exchanges to more relational experiences. For these experiences to be successful, artificial agents need to be able to detect and interpret social cues and interpersonal dynamics; both within and outside of their own human-agent relationships. In this paper, we explore whether AI models can accurately decode one of the arguably most important but complex social signals: romantic attraction. Specifically, we test whether Large Language Models can detect romantic attraction during brief getting-to-know-you interactions between humans. Examining data from 964 speed dates, we show that ChatGPT can predict both objective and subjective indicators of speed dating success (r=0.12-0.23). Although predictive performance remains relatively low, ChatGPT's predictions of actual matching (i.e., the exchange of contact information) were not only on par with those of human judges but incremental to speed daters' own predictions. In addition, ChatGPT's judgments showed substantial overlap with those made by human observers (r=0.21-0.35), highlighting similarities in their representation of romantic attraction that are independent of accuracy. Our findings also offer insights into how ChatGPT arrives at its predictions and the mistakes it makes. Specifically, we use a Brunswik lens approach to identify the linguistic and conversational cues utilized by ChatGPT (and human judges) vis-a-vis those that are predictive of actual matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Lin, Shuchang Liu, Chuyuan Wang, Yongqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting watch time is crucial for optimizing recommendations and user experience in short video platforms. However, existing methods that estimate a single average watch time often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user engagement patterns. In this paper, we propose Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE) to model the entire conditional distribution of watch time. Using quantile regression, CQE characterizes the complex watch-time distribution for each user-video pair, providing a flexible and comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior. We further design multiple strategies to combine the quantile estimates, adapting to different recommendation scenarios and user preferences. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of CQE in watch-time prediction and user engagement modeling. Specifically, deploying CQE online on a large-scale platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users has led to substantial gains in key evaluation metrics, including active days, engagement time, and video views. These results highlight the practical impact of our proposed approach in enhancing the user experience and overall performance of the short video recommendation system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanghyun Choi, Hye Yoon Lee, Dain Kwon, SunJong Park, Kyuyeun Kim, Noseong Park, Jonghyun Choi, Jinho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we observe that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From this observation, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that enhances inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention outputs from each spatial query patch. Then, we align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher by applying head-wise structural attention distillation. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ViT-DFQ. This paper is an extended version of our work published in the proceedings of AAAI 2025, including additional supplementary material.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering. LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings. LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement. Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain. In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering. In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance. We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering. We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p>

However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which are not used for training, leading to wasted annotation costs if data is incorrectly selected. Therefore, to make active learning feasible in real-world applications, it is crucial to consider not only the informativeness of unlabeled samples but also their purity to determine whether they belong to the in-distribution (ID). Recent studies have applied AL under these assumptions, but challenges remain due to the trade-off between informativeness and purity, as well as the heavy dependence on OOD samples. These issues lead to the collection of OOD samples, resulting in a significant waste of annotation costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel query strategy, VLPure-AL, which minimizes cost losses while reducing dependence on OOD samples. VLPure-AL sequentially evaluates the purity and informativeness of data. First, it utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model to detect and exclude OOD data with high accuracy by leveraging linguistic and visual information of ID data. Second, it selects highly informative data from the remaining ID data, and then the selected samples are annotated by human experts. Experimental results on datasets with various open-set conditions demonstrate that VLPure-AL achieves the lowest cost loss and highest performance across all scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structed bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony GX-Chen, Kenneth Marino, Rob Fergus</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.
  We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to learn low level object-perturbing policies via reinforcement learning, and the object mapping itself by supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Rismanchian, Shayan Doroudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational models of human learning can play a significant role in enhancing our knowledge about nuances in theoretical and qualitative learning theories and frameworks. There are many existing frameworks in educational settings that have shown to be verified using empirical studies, but at times we find these theories make conflicting claims or recommendations for instruction. In this study, we propose a new computational model of human learning, Procedural ABICAP, that reconciles the ICAP, Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI), and cognitive load theory (CLT) frameworks for learning procedural knowledge. ICAP assumes that constructive learning generally yields better learning outcomes, while theories such as KLI and CLT claim that this is not always true. We suppose that one reason for this may be that ICAP is primarily used for conceptual learning and is underspecified as a framework for thinking about procedural learning. We show how our computational model, both by design and through simulations, can be used to reconcile different results in the literature. More generally, we position our computational model as an executable theory of learning that can be used to simulate various educational settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Dosi, Massimo Brescia, Stefano Cavuoti, Mariarca D'Aniello, Michele Delli Veneri, Carlo Donadio, Adriano Ettari, Giuseppe Longo, Alvi Rownok, Luca Sannino, Maria Zampella</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized the field of hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis, enabling the extraction of complex spectral and spatial features. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the backbone of HSI classification, their limitations in capturing global contextual features have led to the exploration of Vision Transformers (ViTs). This paper introduces AMBER, an advanced SegFormer specifically designed for multi-band image segmentation. AMBER enhances the original SegFormer by incorporating three-dimensional convolutions, custom kernel sizes, and a Funnelizer layer. This architecture enables processing hyperspectral data directly, without requiring spectral dimensionality reduction during preprocessing. Our experiments, conducted on three benchmark datasets (Salinas, Indian Pines, and Pavia University) and on a dataset from the PRISMA satellite, show that AMBER outperforms traditional CNN-based methods in terms of Overall Accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and Average Accuracy on the first three datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PRISMA dataset. These findings highlight AMBER's robustness, adaptability to both airborne and spaceborne data, and its potential as a powerful solution for remote sensing and other domains requiring advanced analysis of high-dimensional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse van Remmerden, Zaharah Bukhsh, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions, and often yields suboptimal results compared to traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP). We introduce Offline Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Dispatch (Offline-LD), which addresses these limitations by learning from previously generated solutions. Our approach is motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions are available, although our current evaluation focuses on benchmark problems. Offline-LD adapts two CQL-based Q-learning methods (mQRDQN and discrete mSAC) for maskable action spaces, introduces a novel entropy bonus modification for discrete SAC, and exploits reward normalization through preprocessing. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms online RL on both generated and benchmark instances. Notably, by introducing noise into the expert dataset, we achieve similar or better results than those obtained from the expert dataset, suggesting that a more diverse training set is preferable because it contains counterfactual information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caio Fabio Oliveira da Silva, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes an approach that integrates reinforcement learning and model predictive control (MPC) to solve finite-horizon optimal control problems in mixed-logical dynamical systems efficiently. Optimization-based control of such systems with discrete and continuous decision variables entails the online solution of mixed-integer linear programs, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Our approach aims to mitigate this issue by decoupling the decision on the discrete variables from the decision on the continuous variables. In the proposed approach, reinforcement learning determines the discrete decision variables and simplifies the online optimization problem of the MPC controller from a mixed-integer linear program to a linear program, significantly reducing the computational time. A fundamental contribution of this work is the definition of the decoupled Q-function, which plays a crucial role in making the learning problem tractable in a combinatorial action space. We motivate the use of recurrent neural networks to approximate the decoupled Q-function and show how they can be employed in a reinforcement learning setting. Simulation experiments on a microgrid system using real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method substantially reduces the online computation time of MPC while maintaining high feasibility and low suboptimality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the medical field, the limited availability of large-scale datasets and labor-intensive annotation processes hinder the performance of deep models. Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipei Xu, Xuanyu Zhang, Runyi Li, Zecheng Tang, Qing Huang, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI is a double-edged sword, which not only facilitates content creation but also makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. Although current image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods are generally effective, they tend to face two challenges: \textbf{1)} black-box nature with unknown detection principle, \textbf{2)} limited generalization across diverse tampering methods (e.g., Photoshop, DeepFake, AIGC-Editing). To address these issues, we propose the explainable IFDL task and design FakeShield, a multi-modal framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, generating tampered region masks, and providing a judgment basis based on pixel-level and image-level tampering clues. Additionally, we leverage GPT-4o to enhance existing IFDL datasets, creating the Multi-Modal Tamper Description dataSet (MMTD-Set) for training FakeShield's tampering analysis capabilities. Meanwhile, we incorporate a Domain Tag-guided Explainable Forgery Detection Module (DTE-FDM) and a Multi-modal Forgery Localization Module (MFLM) to address various types of tamper detection interpretation and achieve forgery localization guided by detailed textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FakeShield effectively detects and localizes various tampering techniques, offering an explainable and superior solution compared to previous IFDL methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milena Gazdieva, Jaemoo Choi, Alexander Kolesov, Jaewoong Choi, Petr Mokrov, Alexander Korotin</p>
<p>Abstract: Aggregating data from multiple sources can be formalized as an Optimal Transport (OT) barycenter problem, which seeks to compute the average of probability distributions with respect to OT discrepancies. However, in real-world scenarios, the presence of outliers and noise in the data measures can significantly hinder the performance of traditional statistical methods for estimating OT barycenters. To address this issue, we propose a novel scalable approach for estimating the robust continuous barycenter, leveraging the dual formulation of the (semi-)unbalanced OT problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to develop an algorithm for robust barycenters under the continuous distribution setup. Our method is framed as a min-max optimization problem and is adaptable to general cost functions. We rigorously establish the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness to outliers and class imbalance through a number of illustrative experiments.

<p>Abstract: This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we automatically generate 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long in Ego4D based on human-annotated data. This is one of the largest egocentric QA datasets. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a \textit{global glimpse} step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to follow instructions is crucial for numerous real-world applications of language models. In pursuit of deeper insights and more powerful capabilities, we derive instruction-specific vector representations from language models and use them to steer models accordingly. These vectors are computed as the difference in activations between inputs with and without instructions, enabling a modular approach to activation steering. We demonstrate how this method can enhance model adherence to constraints such as output format, length, and word inclusion, providing inference-time control over instruction following. Our experiments across four models demonstrate how we can use the activation vectors to guide models to follow constraints even without explicit instructions and to enhance performance when instructions are present. Additionally, we explore the compositionality of activation steering, successfully applying multiple instructions simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that steering vectors computed on instruction-tuned models can transfer to improve base models. Our findings demonstrate that activation steering offers a practical and scalable approach for fine-grained control in language generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Fayyaz, Raphael Poulain, Rahmatollah Beheshti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in helping with numerous medical challenges. Deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications such as medicine, however, brings in many concerns. One major area of concern relates to biased behaviors of LLMs in medical applications, leading to unfair treatment of individuals. To pave the way for the responsible and impactful deployment of Med LLMs, rigorous evaluation is a key prerequisite. Due to the huge complexity and variability of different medical scenarios, existing work in this domain has primarily relied on using manually crafted datasets for bias evaluation. In this study, we present a new method to scale up such bias evaluations by automatically generating test cases based on rigorous medical evidence. We specifically target the challenges of a) domain-specificity of bias characterization, b) hallucinating while generating the test cases, and c) various dependencies between the health outcomes and sensitive attributes. To that end, we offer new methods to address these challenges integrated with our generative pipeline, using medical knowledge graphs, medical ontologies, and customized general LLM evaluation frameworks in our method. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that the test cases generated by our proposed method can effectively reveal bias patterns in Med LLMs at larger and more flexible scales than human-crafted datasets. We publish a large bias evaluation dataset using our pipeline, which is dedicated to a few medical case studies.

<p>Abstract: Diagnosing and treating skin diseases require advanced visual skills across domains and the ability to synthesize information from multiple imaging modalities. While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks like skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images, and enhanced non-dermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results demonstrate PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elyas Obbad, Iddah Mlauzi, Brando Miranda, Rylan Schaeffer, Kamal Obbad, Suhana Bedi, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection is crucial for optimizing language model (LM) performance on specific tasks, yet most existing methods fail to effectively consider the target task distribution.
  Current approaches either ignore task-specific requirements entirely or rely on approximations that fail to capture the nuanced patterns needed for tasks like Autoformalization or code generation.
  Methods that do consider the target distribution often rely on simplistic, sometimes noisy, representations, like hashed n-gram features, which can lead to collisions and introduce noise.
  We introduce ZIP-FIT, a data selection framework that uses gzip compression to directly measure alignment between potential training data and the target task distribution.
  In extensive evaluations on Autoformalization and Python code generation, ZIP-FIT significantly outperforms leading baselines like DSIR and D4.
  Models trained on ZIP-FIT-selected data achieve their lowest cross-entropy loss up to 85.1\% faster than baselines, demonstrating that better task alignment leads to more efficient learning.
  In addition, ZIP-FIT performs selection up to 65.8\% faster than DSIR and two orders of magnitude faster than D4.
  Notably, ZIP-FIT shows that smaller, well-aligned datasets often outperform larger but less targeted ones, demonstrating that a small amount of higher quality data is superior to a large amount of lower quality data.
  Our results imply that task-aware data selection is crucial for efficient domain adaptation, and that compression offers a principled way to measure task alignment.
  By showing that targeted data selection can dramatically improve task-specific performance, our work provides new insights into the relationship between data quality, task alignment, and model learning efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyang Li, Caesar Wu, Mohammed Chadli, Said Mammar, Pascal Bouvry</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) uses multiple nodes to accelerate training, enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a key optimization algorithm, plays a central role in this process. However, communication bottlenecks often limit scalability and efficiency, leading to increasing adoption of compressed SGD techniques to alleviate these challenges. Despite addressing communication overheads, compressed SGD introduces trustworthiness concerns, as gradient exchanges among nodes are vulnerable to attacks like gradient inversion (GradInv) and membership inference attacks (MIA). The trustworthiness of compressed SGD remains unexplored, leaving important questions about its reliability unanswered.
  In this paper, we provide a trustworthiness evaluation of compressed versus uncompressed SGD. Specifically, we conducted empirical studies using GradInv attacks, revealing that compressed SGD demonstrates significantly higher resistance to privacy leakage compared to uncompressed SGD. In addition, our findings suggest that MIA may not be a reliable metric for assessing privacy risks in distributed learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Guan, Jian Cao, Shiyou Qian, Jianqi Gao, Chun Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Software systems often record important runtime information in logs to help with troubleshooting. Log-based anomaly detection has become a key research area that aims to identify system issues through log data, ultimately enhancing the reliability of software systems. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle to capture the semantic information embedded in log data, which is typically organized in natural language. In this paper, we propose LogLLM, a log-based anomaly detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs). LogLLM employs BERT for extracting semantic vectors from log messages, while utilizing Llama, a transformer decoder-based model, for classifying log sequences. Additionally, we introduce a projector to align the vector representation spaces of BERT and Llama, ensuring a cohesive understanding of log semantics. Unlike conventional methods that require log parsers to extract templates, LogLLM preprocesses log messages with regular expressions, streamlining the entire process. Our framework is trained through a novel three-stage procedure designed to enhance performance and adaptability. Experimental results across four public datasets demonstrate that LogLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Even when handling unstable logs, it effectively captures the semantic meaning of log messages and detects anomalies accurately.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangqi Lei, Keke Gai, Jing Yu, Liehuang Zhu, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating specific concepts but also pose threats to copyright protection and illegal use. Model Watermarking is an effective method to prevent the unauthorized use of subject-driven or style-driven image generation, safeguarding concept copyrights. However, under the goal of concept-oriented protection, current watermarking schemes typically add watermarks to all images rather than applying them in a refined manner targeted at specific concepts. Additionally, the personalization techniques of diffusion models can easily remove watermarks. Existing watermarking methods struggle to achieve fine-grained watermark embedding with a few images of specific concept and prevent removal of watermarks through personalized fine-tuning. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept-oriented watermarking framework that seamlessly embeds imperceptible watermarks into the concept of diffusion models. We introduce Fidelity-preserving Latent Watermarking (FLW) to generate latent watermarks based on image characteristics and the Adversarial Watermarking Modulation module to prevent "jailbreaking" via personalized finetuning. To enhance U-Net's efficiency in learning watermark patterns with limited samples, we propose Efficient Concept Watermark Finetuning, which alternates optimization of model parameters for both watermark embedding and concept learning. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our framework. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Conceptwm-4EB3/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiron Thalagala, Pak Kin Wong, Xiaozheng Wang, Tianang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of continuous control, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) demonstrates promising results. However, the dependence of DRL on deep neural networks (DNNs) results in the demand for extensive data and increased computational cost. To address this issue, a novel hybrid actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced. The proposed framework integrates the broad learning system (BLS) with DNN, aiming to merge the strengths of both distinct architectural paradigms. Specifically, the critic network employs BLS for rapid value estimation via ridge regression, while the actor network retains the DNN structure to optimize policy gradients. This hybrid design is generalizable and can enhance existing actor-critic algorithms. To demonstrate its versatility, the proposed framework is integrated into three widely used actor-critic algorithms -- deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), soft actor-critic (SAC), and twin delayed DDPG (TD3), resulting in BLS-augmented variants. Experimental results reveal that all BLS-enhanced versions surpass their original counterparts in terms of training efficiency and accuracy. These improvements highlight the suitability of the proposed framework for real-time control scenarios, where computational efficiency and rapid adaptation are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinheng Xie, Yue Wu, Cuiyu He</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding adversarial examples is crucial for improving model robustness, as they introduce imperceptible perturbations to deceive models. Effective adversarial examples, therefore, offer the potential to train more robust models by eliminating model singularities. We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel approach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to simulate generator dynamics. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based methods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that preserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also propose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability in black-box attacks by tuning the noise parameters during training. Experiments demonstrate that NODE-AdvGAN and NODE-AdvGAN-T generate more effective adversarial examples that achieve higher attack success rates while preserving better perceptual quality than baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Bar, Gaoyue Zhou, Danny Tran, Trevor Darrell, Yann LeCun</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sofiane Ennadir, Gabriela Zarzar Gandler, Filip Cornell, Lele Cao, Oleg Smirnov, Tianze Wang, Levente Z\'olyomi, Bj\"orn Brinne, Sahar Asadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapeng Tang, Davide Davoli, Tobias Kirschstein, Liam Schoneveld, Matthias Niessner</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for reconstructing animatable 3D Gaussian avatars from monocular videos captured by commodity devices like smartphones. Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve facial identity and appearance details. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from monocular videos captured on commodity devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoqing Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Kehai Chen, Rongxiang Weng, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite being empowered with alignment mechanisms, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to emerging jailbreak attacks that can compromise their alignment mechanisms. This vulnerability poses significant risks to real-world applications. Existing work faces challenges in both training efficiency and generalization capabilities (i.e., Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Red-Teaming). Developing effective strategies to enable LLMs to resist continuously evolving jailbreak attempts represents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defensive paradigm called GuidelineLLM, which assists LLMs in recognizing queries that may have harmful content. Before LLMs respond to a query, GuidelineLLM first identifies potential risks associated with the query, summarizes these risks into guideline suggestions, and then feeds these guidelines to the responding LLMs. Importantly, our approach eliminates the necessity for additional safety fine-tuning of the LLMs themselves; only the GuidelineLLM requires fine-tuning. This characteristic enhances the general applicability of GuidelineLLM across various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidelineLLM can significantly reduce the attack success rate (ASR) against LLM (an average reduction of 34.17\% ASR) while maintaining the usefulness of LLM in handling benign queries.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10924">Tokens, the oft-overlooked appetizer: Large language models, the distributional hypothesis, and meaning</a></h1>

<p>Abstract: Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Wang, Quanfeng Liu, Jiaqi Fan, Jinlong Hong, Hongqing Chu, Mengjian Tian, Bingzhao Gao, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, cross-modal alignment fine-tuning with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying pipeline based on KMeans clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Mamba has shown close to state of the art performance on computer vision tasks, drawing much interest in increasing it's efficiency. A promising approach is token reduction (that has been successfully implemented in ViTs). Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and degraded performance. An alternative, of merging tokens preserves more information than pruning, also suffers for large compression ratios. Our key insight is that a quick round of retraining after token merging yeilds robust results across various compression ratios. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drops 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aodi Li, Liansheng Zhuang, Xiao Long, Minghong Yao, Shafei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization aims to learn a model from multiple training domains and generalize it to unseen test domains. Recent theory has shown that seeking the deep models, whose parameters lie in the flat minima of the loss landscape, can significantly reduce the out-of-domain generalization error. However, existing methods often neglect the consistency of loss landscapes in different domains, resulting in models that are not simultaneously in the optimal flat minima in all domains, which limits their generalization ability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an iterative Self-Feedback Training (SFT) framework to seek consistent flat minima that are shared across different domains by progressively refining loss landscapes during training. It alternatively generates a feedback signal by measuring the inconsistency of loss landscapes in different domains and refines these loss landscapes for greater consistency using this feedback signal. Benefiting from the consistency of the flat minima within these refined loss landscapes, our SFT helps achieve better out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments on DomainBed demonstrate superior performances of SFT when compared to state-of-the-art sharpness-aware methods and other prevalent DG baselines. On average across five DG benchmarks, SFT surpasses the sharpness-aware minimization by 2.6% with ResNet-50 and 1.5% with ViT-B/16, respectively. The code will be available soon.</p>

Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Gong, Akshat Kumar, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Tempel, Daniel Groos, Espen Alexander F. Ihlen, Lars Adde, Inga Str\"umke</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models using eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques has become essential to make them more transparent and trustworthy. This is especially important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where understanding model decisions is critical to ensure ethical, sound, and trustworthy outcome predictions. However, users are often confused about which explanability method to choose for their specific use case. We present a comparative analysis of widely used explainability methods, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), within the domain of human activity recognition (HAR) utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCNs). By evaluating these methods on skeleton-based data from two real-world datasets, including a healthcare-critical cerebral palsy (CP) case, this study provides vital insights into both approaches' strengths, limitations, and differences, offering a roadmap for selecting the most appropriate explanation method based on specific models and applications. We quantitatively and quantitatively compare these methods, focusing on feature importance ranking, interpretability, and model sensitivity through perturbation experiments. While SHAP provides detailed input feature attribution, Grad-CAM delivers faster, spatially oriented explanations, making both methods complementary depending on the application's requirements. Given the importance of XAI in enhancing trust and transparency in ML models, particularly in sensitive environments like healthcare, our research demonstrates how SHAP and Grad-CAM could complement each other to provide more interpretable and actionable model explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization problems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process, including crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without relying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.</p>

<p>Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors decrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator model $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our experiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support our theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting with adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of the origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for combating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongruixuan Chen, Jian Song, Olivier Dietrich, Clifford Broni-Bediako, Weihao Xuan, Junjue Wang, Xinlei Shao, Yimin Wei, Junshi Xia, Cuiling Lan, Konrad Schindler, Naoto Yokoya</p>
<p>Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Dong, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the literature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Manuel Baldonado, Flavia Bonomo-Braberman, V\'ictor Adri\'an Braberman</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and verifiability of large language model (LLM)-enabled systems remains a significant challenge in software engineering. We propose a probabilistic framework for systematically analyzing and improving these systems by modeling and refining distributions over clusters of semantically equivalent outputs. This framework facilitates the evaluation and iterative improvement of Transference Models--key software components that utilize LLMs to transform inputs into outputs for downstream tasks. To illustrate its utility, we apply the framework to the autoformalization problem, where natural language documentation is transformed into formal program specifications. Our case illustrates how distribution-aware analysis enables the identification of weaknesses and guides focused alignment improvements, resulting in more reliable and interpretable outputs. This principled approach offers a foundation for addressing critical challenges in the development of robust LLM-enabled systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonho Ko, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> KaiHui Huang, RunQing Wu, JinHui Shen, HanYi Zhang, Ling Ge, JiGuo Yu, Fei Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a pivotal area of research, primarily due to its advantageous characteristic that allows models to persistently acquire and retain information. However, catastrophic forgetting can severely impair model performance. In this study, we address network forgetting by introducing a novel framework termed Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy (OWMMD), which imposes penalties on representation alterations via a Multi-Level Feature Matching Mechanism (MLFMM). Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO) strategy to refine the adaptive weight vectors, which autonomously assess the significance of each feature layer throughout the optimization process, The proposed ARO approach can relieve the over-regularization problem and promote the future task learning. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, benchmarking our proposed method against several established baselines. The empirical findings indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In view of the gap in the current large language model in sharing memory across dialogues, this research proposes a wormhole memory module (WMM) to realize memory as a Rubik's cube that can be arbitrarily retrieved between different dialogues. Through simulation experiments, the researcher built an experimental framework based on the Python environment and used setting memory barriers to simulate the current situation where memories between LLMs dialogues are difficult to share. The CoQA development data set was imported into the experiment, and the feasibility of its cross-dialogue memory retrieval function was verified for WMM's nonlinear indexing and dynamic retrieval, and a comparative analysis was conducted with the capabilities of Titans and MemGPT memory modules. Experimental results show that WMM demonstrated the ability to retrieve memory across dialogues and the stability of quantitative indicators in eight experiments. It contributes new technical approaches to the optimization of memory management of LLMs and provides experience for the practical application in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihui Zhao, Yingxin Li, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained by high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision modality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing visual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges. Existing approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or directly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often compromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of visual data. In this work, we propose a token compression paradigm that operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach includes a learning-free, plug-and-play compression pipeline that can be seamlessly integrated into most Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks. By leveraging this method, we enhance the model inference capability while simultaneously reducing its computational cost. Experimental results on the Video-QA task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p>

We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds.

In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01436">Towards Safer Chatbots: A Framework for Policy Compliance Evaluation of Custom GPTs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> David Rodriguez, William Seymour, Jose M. Del Alamo, Jose Such</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving widespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society. The capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks has facilitated the emergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made available through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However, their black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In this work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of Custom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible behaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) automated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a red-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the characteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to analyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate our framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a large-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic, Cybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1 score of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of the framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed models exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT store's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance issues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than user-driven customizations. We believe this approach is extendable to other chatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Xue, Wentao Dong, Minghuan Liu, Weinan Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Locomotion is a fundamental skill for humanoid robots. However, most existing works make locomotion a single, tedious, unextendable, and unconstrained movement. This limits the kinematic capabilities of humanoid robots. In contrast, humans possess versatile athletic abilities-running, jumping, hopping, and finely adjusting gait parameters such as frequency and foot height. In this paper, we investigate solutions to bring such versatility into humanoid locomotion and thereby propose HugWBC: a unified and general humanoid whole-body controller for versatile locomotion. By designing a general command space in the aspect of tasks and behaviors, along with advanced techniques like symmetrical loss and intervention training for learning a whole-body humanoid controlling policy in simulation, HugWBC enables real-world humanoid robots to produce various natural gaits, including walking, jumping, standing, and hopping, with customizable parameters such as frequency, foot swing height, further combined with different body height, waist rotation, and body pitch. Beyond locomotion, HugWBC also supports real-time interventions from external upper-body controllers like teleoperation, enabling loco-manipulation with precision under any locomotive behavior. Extensive experiments validate the high tracking accuracy and robustness of HugWBC with/without upper-body intervention for all commands, and we further provide an in-depth analysis of how the various commands affect humanoid movement and offer insights into the relationships between these commands. To our knowledge, HugWBC is the first humanoid whole-body controller that supports such versatile locomotion behaviors with high robustness and flexibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions.

<p>Abstract: Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the attack success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingtong Yu, Zechuan Gong, Chang Zhou, Yuan Fang, Hui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are able to model interconnected entities in many online services, supporting a wide range of applications on the Web. This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Chen, Shuai Tian, Shugao Liu, Yingting Zhou, Haoran Li, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown substantial potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, fine-tuning these models through supervised learning struggles to achieve robust performance due to limited, inconsistent demonstrations, especially in contact-rich environments. In this paper, we propose a reinforced fine-tuning approach for VLA models, named ConRFT, which consists of offline and online fine-tuning with a unified consistency-based training objective, to address these challenges. In the offline stage, our method integrates behavior cloning and Q-learning to effectively extract policy from a small set of demonstrations and stabilize value estimating. In the online stage, the VLA model is further fine-tuned via consistency policy, with human interventions to ensure safe exploration and high sample efficiency. We evaluate our approach on eight diverse real-world manipulation tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 96.3% within 45-90 minutes of online fine-tuning, outperforming prior supervised methods with a 144% improvement in success rate and 1.9x shorter episode length. This work highlights the potential of integrating reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of VLA models for real-world robotic applications.

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement (DRL) Learning to address motion control challenges in drones for additive manufacturing (AM). Drone-based additive manufacturing promises flexible and autonomous material deposition in large-scale or hazardous environments. However, achieving robust real-time control of a multi-rotor aerial robot under varying payloads and potential disturbances remains challenging. Traditional controllers like PID often require frequent parameter re-tuning, limiting their applicability in dynamic scenarios. We propose a DRL framework that learns adaptable control policies for multi-rotor drones performing waypoint navigation in AM tasks. We compare Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) within a curriculum learning scheme designed to handle increasing complexity. Our experiments show TD3 consistently balances training stability, accuracy, and success, particularly when mass variability is introduced. These findings provide a scalable path toward robust, autonomous drone control in additive manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjin Huang, Haotian Hu, Zhenyu Zhang, Gaojie Jin, Xiang Li, Li Shen, Tianlong Chen, Lu Liu, Qingsong Wen, Zhangyang Wang, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical $l_2$-norm statistics; and $(3)$ inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to $2$ perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Havrilla, David Alvarez-Melis, Nicolo Fusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models ($\textbf{LLMs}$) have emerged as a powerful method for discovery. Instead of utilizing numerical data, LLMs utilize associated variable $\textit{semantic metadata}$ to predict variable relationships. Simultaneously, LLMs demonstrate impressive abilities to act as black-box optimizers when given an objective $f$ and sequence of trials. We study LLMs at the intersection of these two capabilities by applying LLMs to the task of $\textit{interactive graph discovery}$: given a ground truth graph $G^*$ capturing variable relationships and a budget of $I$ edge experiments over $R$ rounds, minimize the distance between the predicted graph $\hat{G}_R$ and $G^*$ at the end of the $R$-th round. To solve this task we propose $\textbf{IGDA}$, a LLM-based pipeline incorporating two key components: 1) an LLM uncertainty-driven method for edge experiment selection 2) a local graph update strategy utilizing binary feedback from experiments to improve predictions for unselected neighboring edges. Experiments on eight different real-world graphs show our approach often outperforms all baselines including a state-of-the-art numerical method for interactive graph discovery. Further, we conduct a rigorous series of ablations dissecting the impact of each pipeline component. Finally, to assess the impact of memorization, we apply our interactive graph discovery strategy to a complex, new (as of July 2024) causal graph on protein transcription factors, finding strong performance in a setting where memorization is impossible. Overall, our results show IGDA to be a powerful method for graph discovery complementary to existing numerically driven approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ads recommendation is a prominent service of online advertising systems and has been actively studied. Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjoo Lim, Bogyeong Kang, Tae-Eui Kam</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for providing complementary information about brain anatomy and pathology, leading to more accurate diagnoses. However, obtaining high-quality multi-modal MRI in a clinical setting is difficult due to factors such as time constraints, high costs, and patient movement artifacts. To overcome this difficulty, there is increasing interest in developing generative models that can synthesize missing target modality images from the available source ones. Therefore, our team, PLAVE, design a generative model for missing MRI that integrates multi-modal contrastive learning with a focus on critical tumor regions. Specifically, we integrate multi-modal contrastive learning, tailored for multiple source modalities, and enhance its effectiveness by selecting features based on entropy during the contrastive learning process. Additionally, our network not only generates the missing target modality images but also predicts segmentation outputs, simultaneously. This approach improves the generator's capability to precisely generate tumor regions, ultimately improving performance in downstream segmentation tasks. By leveraging a combination of contrastive, segmentation, and additional self-representation losses, our model effectively reflects target-specific information and generate high-quality target images. Consequently, our results in the Brain MR Image Synthesis challenge demonstrate that the proposed model excelled in generating the missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Marius Lillelund, Shi-ang Qi, Russell Greiner</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional survival metrics, such as Harrell's concordance index and the Brier Score, rely on the independent censoring assumption for valid inference in the presence of right-censored data. However, when instances are censored for reasons related to the event of interest, this assumption no longer holds, as this kind of dependent censoring biases the marginal survival estimates of popular nonparametric estimators. In this paper, we propose three copula-based metrics to evaluate survival models in the presence of dependent censoring, and design a framework to create realistic, semi-synthetic datasets with dependent censoring to facilitate the evaluation of the metrics. Our empirical analyses in synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that our metrics can give error estimates that are closer to the true error, mainly in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning systems has raised critical concerns about fairness and bias, making mitigating harmful biases essential for AI development. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between fairness improvement and the removal of harmful biases in neural networks applied to computer vision tasks. First, we introduce a set of novel XAI-based metrics that analyze saliency maps to assess shifts in a model's decision-making process. Then, we demonstrate that successful debiasing methods systematically redirect model focus away from protected attributes. Additionally, we show that techniques originally developed for artifact removal can be effectively repurposed for fairness. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring that models are fair for the right reasons, contributing to the development of more ethical and trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vibeke Binz Vallevik, Serena Elizabeth Marshall, Aleksandar Babic, Jan Franz Nygaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is emerging as a cost-effective solution necessary to meet the increasing data demands of AI development, created either from existing knowledge or derived from real data. The traditional classification of synthetic data types into hybrid, partial or fully synthetic datasets has limited value and does not reflect the ever-increasing methods to generate synthetic data. The generation method and their source jointly shape the characteristics of synthetic data, which in turn determines its practical applications. We make a case for an alternative approach to grouping synthetic data types that better reflect privacy perspectives in order to facilitate regulatory guidance in the generation and processing of synthetic data. This approach to classification provides flexibility to new advancements like deep generative methods and offers a more practical framework for future applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hank Gerba</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI promises to finally realize dynamic, personalized storytelling technologies across a range of media. To date, experimentation with generative AI in the field of procedural narrative generation has been quite promising from a technical perspective. However, fundamental narrative dilemmas remain, such as the balance between player agency and narrative coherence, and no rigorous narrative standard has been proposed to specifically leverage the strengths of generative AI. In this paper, we propose the Narrative Context Protocol (NCP), an open and extensible standard designed to place writers at the center of future narrative design workflows and enable interoperability across authoring platforms. By encoding an author's intent according to an objective narrative model, the NCP enables narrative portability as well as intent-based constraints for generative systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxin Zheng, Zhenjie Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDE, while aligning with the degraded objective function. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</p>

<p>Abstract: After-action reviews (AARs) are professional discussions that help operators and teams enhance their task performance by analyzing completed missions with peers and professionals. Previous studies that compared different formats of AARs have mainly focused on human teams. However, the inclusion of robotic teammates brings along new challenges in understanding teammate intent and communication. Traditional AAR between human teammates may not be satisfactory for human-robot teams. To address this limitation, we propose a new training review (TR) tool, called the Virtual Spectator Interface (VSI), to enhance human-robot team performance and situational awareness (SA) in a simulated search mission. The proposed VSI primarily utilizes visual feedback to review subjects' behavior. To examine the effectiveness of VSI, we took elements from AAR to conduct our own TR, designed a 1 x 3 between-subjects experiment with experimental conditions: TR with (1) VSI, (2) screen recording, and (3) non-technology (only verbal descriptions). The results of our experiments demonstrated that the VSI did not result in significantly better team performance than other conditions. However, the TR with VSI led to more improvement in the subjects SA over the other conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franco Caspe, Jordie Shier, Mark Sandler, Charalampos Saitis, Andrew McPherson</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS) models offer interactive musical control over high-quality, expressive audio generators. While these models can operate in real-time, they often suffer from high latency, making them unsuitable for intimate musical interaction. The impact of architectural choices in deep learning models on audio latency remains largely unexplored in the NAS literature. In this work, we investigate the sources of latency and jitter typically found in interactive NAS models. We then apply this analysis to the task of timbre transfer using RAVE, a convolutional variational autoencoder for audio waveforms introduced by Caillon et al. in 2021. Finally, we present an iterative design approach for optimizing latency. This culminates with a model we call BRAVE (Bravely Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder), which is low-latency and exhibits better pitch and loudness replication while showing timbre modification capabilities similar to RAVE. We implement it in a specialized inference framework for low-latency, real-time inference and present a proof-of-concept audio plugin compatible with audio signals from musical instruments. We expect the challenges and guidelines described in this document to support NAS researchers in designing models for low-latency inference from the ground up, enriching the landscape of possibilities for musicians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinan Fan, Liang Xie, Chen Shen, Ge Teng, Xiaosong Yuan, Xiaofeng Zhang, Chenxi Huang, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called Dynamic Prompt Corruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4%-8% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \`Alex Pujol Vidal, Sergio Escalera, Kamal Nasrollahi, Thomas B. Moeslund</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning methods have become increasingly important for selective concept removal in large pre-trained models. While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Barnes, Naiara Perez, Alba Bonet-Jover, Bego\~na Altuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Studies on evaluation metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge models for automatic text summarization have largely been focused on English, limiting our understanding of their effectiveness in other languages. Through our new dataset BASSE (BAsque and Spanish Summarization Evaluation), we address this situation by collecting human judgments on 2,040 abstractive summaries in Basque and Spanish, generated either manually or by five LLMs with four different prompts. For each summary, annotators evaluated five criteria on a 5-point Likert scale: coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance, and 5W1H. We use these data to reevaluate traditional automatic metrics used for evaluating summaries, as well as several LLM-as-a-Judge models that show strong performance on this task in English. Our results show that currently proprietary judge LLMs have the highest correlation with human judgments, followed by criteria-specific automatic metrics, while open-sourced judge LLMs perform poorly. We release BASSE and our code publicly, along with the first large-scale Basque summarization dataset containing 22,525 news articles with their subheads.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal understanding plays a crucial role in artificial intelligence by enabling models to jointly interpret inputs from different modalities. However, conventional approaches such as contrastive learning often struggle with modality discrepancies, leading to potential misalignments. In this paper, we propose a novel class anchor alignment approach that leverages class probability distributions for multi-modal representation learning. Our method, Class-anchor-ALigned generative Modeling (CALM), encodes class anchors as prompts to generate and align class probability distributions for each modality, enabling more effective alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-modal probabilistic variational autoencoder to model uncertainty in the alignment, enhancing the ability to capture deeper relationships between modalities and data variations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in out-of-domain evaluations. This highlights its superior generalization capabilities in multi-modal representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daphne Lenders, Andrea Pugnana, Roberto Pellungrini, Toon Calders, Dino Pedreschi, Fosca Giannotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstaining classifiers have the option to refrain from providing a prediction for instances that are difficult to classify. The abstention mechanism is designed to trade off the classifier's performance on the accepted data while ensuring a minimum number of predictions. In this setting, often fairness concerns arise when the abstention mechanism solely reduces errors for the majority groups of the data, resulting in increased performance differences across demographic groups. While there exist a bunch of methods that aim to reduce discrimination when abstaining, there is no mechanism that can do so in an explainable way. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing Interpretable and Fair Abstaining Classifier IFAC, an algorithm that can reject predictions both based on their uncertainty and their unfairness. By rejecting possibly unfair predictions, our method reduces error and positive decision rate differences across demographic groups of the non-rejected data. Since the unfairness-based rejections are based on an interpretable-by-design method, i.e., rule-based fairness checks and situation testing, we create a transparent process that can empower human decision-makers to review the unfair predictions and make more just decisions for them. This explainable aspect is especially important in light of recent AI regulations, mandating that any high-risk decision task should be overseen by human experts to reduce discrimination risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, John Sabatini, Diego Zapata-Rivera, Carol Forsyth, Yang Jiang, John Hollander, Xiangen Hu, Arthur C. Graesser</p>
<p>Abstract: Learner performance data collected by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), such as responses to questions, is essential for modeling and predicting learners' knowledge states. However, missing responses due to skips or incomplete attempts create data sparsity, challenging accurate assessment and personalized instruction. To address this, we propose a generative imputation approach using Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN). Our method features a three-dimensional (3D) framework (learners, questions, and attempts), flexibly accommodating various sparsity levels. Enhanced by convolutional neural networks and optimized with a least squares loss function, the GAIN-based method aligns input and output dimensions to question-attempt matrices along the learners' dimension. Extensive experiments using datasets from AutoTutor Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC), ASSISTments, and MATHia demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms tensor factorization and alternative GAN methods in imputation accuracy across different attempt scenarios. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) further validates the effectiveness of the imputed data by estimating learning parameters: initial knowledge (P(L0)), learning rate (P(T)), guess rate (P(G)), and slip rate (P(S)). Results indicate the imputed data enhances model fit and closely mirrors original distributions, capturing underlying learning behaviors reliably. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence assessments confirm minimal divergence, showing the imputed data preserves essential learning characteristics effectively. These findings underscore GAIN's capability as a robust imputation tool in ITSs, alleviating data sparsity and supporting adaptive, individualized instruction, ultimately leading to more precise and responsive learner assessments and improved educational outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ever-increasing security vulnerabilities in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems require improved threat detection approaches. This paper presents a compact and efficient approach to detect botnet attacks by employing an integrated approach that consists of traffic pattern analysis, temporal support learning, and focused feature extraction.

The proposed model's performance is further validated by key parameters, such as Mathews Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's kappa Correlation Coefficient. The close-to-ideal results for these parameters demonstrate the proposed model's ability to detect botnet attacks accurately and efficiently in practical settings and on unseen data. The proposed model proved to be a powerful defense mechanism for IoT networks to face emerging security challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongyu Zhang, Menghang Dong, Yuan Zhang, Liang Heng, Xiaowei Chi, Gaole Dai, Li Du, Yuan Du, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaskaran Singh Walia, Shravan Venkatraman, Pavithra LK</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater images suffer from severe degradations, including color distortions, reduced visibility, and loss of structural details due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Amir, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding - a novel method to embed multisets and measures over $\mathbb{R}^d$ into Euclidean space.
  Our proposed embedding approximately preserves the sliced Wasserstein distance on distributions, thereby yielding geometrically meaningful representations that better capture the structure of the input. Moreover, it is injective on measures and bi-Lipschitz on multisets - a significant advantage over prevalent methods based on sum- or max-pooling, which are provably not bi-Lipschitz, and, in many cases, not even injective. The required output dimension for these guarantees is near-optimal: roughly $2 N d$, where $N$ is the maximal input multiset size.
  Furthermore, we prove that it is impossible to embed distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ into Euclidean space in a bi-Lipschitz manner. Thus, the metric properties of our embedding are, in a sense, the best possible.
  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method yields superior multiset representations that improve performance in practical learning tasks. Specifically, we show that (a) a simple combination of the FSW embedding with an MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning the (non-sliced) Wasserstein distance; and (b) replacing max-pooling with the FSW embedding makes PointNet significantly more robust to parameter reduction, with only minor performance degradation even after a 40-fold reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zheng, Enze Liu, Zhongfu Chen, Zhongrui Ma, Yue Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to recommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier. However, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for low-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTGRec significantly outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zheng, Hongyu Lu, Yu Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangqiang Li, M. Amine Atoui, Xiangshun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault diagnosis in multimode processes plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial systems across multiple modes. It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006">Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Kochnev, Arash Torabi Goodarzi, Zofia Antonina Bentyn, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rijul Magu, Arka Dutta, Sean Kim, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh, Munmun De Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexej Schelle</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents an encryption model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Encryption of RTF-8 data is realized by dynamically generating decimal numbers that lead to the encryption and decryption of alphabetic strings in integer representation by simple addition rules, the modulus of the dimension of the considered alphabet. The binary numbers for the private dynamic keys correspond to the binary numbers of public reference keys, as defined by a specific GAN configuration. For reversible encryption with a bijective mapping between dynamic and reference keys, as defined by the GAN encryptor, secure text encryption can be achieved by transferring a GAN-encrypted public key along with the encrypted text from a sender to a receiver. Using the technique described above, secure text mail transfer can be realized through component-wise encryption and decryption of text mail strings, with total key sizes of up to $10^{8}$ bits that define random decimal numbers generated by the GAN. From the present model, we assert that encrypted texts can be transmitted more efficiently and securely than from RSA encryption, as long as users of the specific configuration of the GAN encryption model are unaware of the GAN encryptor circuit and configuration, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendi Lin, Heshan Liu, Qunshu Lin, Zachary Bright, Shitao Tang, Yihui He, Minghao Liu, Ling Zhu, Cindy Le</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Objaverse++, a curated subset of Objaverse enhanced with detailed attribute annotations by human experts. Recent advances in 3D content generation have been driven by large-scale datasets such as Objaverse, which contains over 800,000 3D objects collected from the Internet. Although Objaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is limited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation, we manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including aesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object composition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural network capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset. Through experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that models pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance than those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation tasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by our tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the training loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich annotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more efficient path to develop 3D generative models. We release our enhanced dataset of approximately 500,000 curated 3D models to facilitate further research on various downstream tasks in 3D computer vision. In the near future, we aim to extend our annotations to cover the entire Objaverse dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanna Cui, Peizheng Wang, Faliang Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction is crucial in intelligent transportation systems. The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizi Zhang, Yanchen Wang, Mehdi Azabou, Alexandre Andre, Zixuan Wang, Hanrui Lyu, The International Brain Laboratory, Eva Dyer, Liam Paninski, Cole Hurwitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for context understanding in virtual reality (VR). However, VR contexts are often highly localized and personalized, limiting the effectiveness of general-purpose LLMs. To address this challenge, we present RAG-VR, the first 3D question-answering system for VR that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which augments an LLM with external knowledge retrieved from a localized knowledge database to improve the answer quality. RAG-VR includes a pipeline for extracting comprehensive knowledge about virtual environments and user conditions for accurate answer generation. To ensure efficient retrieval, RAG-VR offloads the retrieval process to a nearby edge server and uses only essential information during retrieval. Moreover, we train the retriever to effectively distinguish among relevant, irrelevant, and hard-to-differentiate information in relation to questions. RAG-VR improves answer accuracy by 17.9%-41.8% and reduces end-to-end latency by 34.5%-47.3% compared with two baseline systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks are widely used for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their reliability is undermined by benchmark contamination. In this study, we reframe contamination as an inherent aspect of learning and seek to disentangle genuine capability acquisition from superficial memorization in LLM evaluation. First, by analyzing model performance under different memorization conditions, we uncover a counterintuitive trend: LLMs perform worse on memorized MCQs than on non-memorized ones, indicating the coexistence of two distinct learning phenomena, i.e., rote memorization and genuine capability learning. To disentangle them, we propose TrinEval, a novel evaluation framework that reformulates MCQs into an alternative trinity format, reducing memorization while preserving knowledge assessment. Experiments validate TrinEval's effectiveness in reformulation, and its evaluation reveals that common LLMs may memorize by rote 20.5% of knowledge points (in MMLU on average).</p>

Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.).
