<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis, Vince Trencsenyi</p>
<p>Abstract: Game-theoretic simulations are a versatile tool for exploring interactions of both natural and artificial agents. However, modelling real-world scenarios and developing simulations often require substantial human expertise and effort. To streamline this process, we present a framework that enables the autoformalization of game-theoretic scenarios using agents augmented by large language models (LLMs). In this approach, LLM-augmented agents translate natural language scenario descriptions into executable logic programs that define the rules of each game, validating these programs for syntactic accuracy. A tournament simulation is then conducted, during which the agents test the functionality of the generated games by playing them. When a ground truth payoff matrix is available, an exact semantic validation can also be performed. The validated games can then be used in further simulations to assess the effectiveness of different strategies. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of 55 natural language descriptions across five well-known 2x2 simultaneous-move games, demonstrating 96% syntactic and 87% semantic correctness in the generated game rules. Additionally, we assess the LLM-augmented agents' capability to autoformalize strategies for gameplay.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08841">Structural Entropy Guided Probabilistic Coding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Huang, Hao Peng, Li Sun, Hui Lin, Chunyang Liu, Jiang Cao, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic embeddings have several advantages over deterministic embeddings as they map each data point to a distribution, which better describes the uncertainty and complexity of data. Many works focus on adjusting the distribution constraint under the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to enhance representation learning. However, these proposed regularization terms only consider the constraint of each latent variable, omitting the structural information between latent variables. In this paper, we propose a novel structural entropy-guided probabilistic coding model, named SEPC. Specifically, we incorporate the relationship between latent variables into the optimization by proposing a structural entropy regularization loss. Besides, as traditional structural information theory is not well-suited for regression tasks, we propose a probabilistic encoding tree, transferring regression tasks to classification tasks while diminishing the influence of the transformation. Experimental results across 12 natural language understanding tasks, including both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate the superior performance of SEPC compared to other state-of-the-art models in terms of effectiveness, generalization capability, and robustness to label noise.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08897">Neural Interactive Proofs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lewis Hammond, Sam Adam-Day</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of how a trusted, but computationally bounded agent (a 'verifier') can learn to interact with one or more powerful but untrusted agents ('provers') in order to solve a given task. More specifically, we study the case in which agents are represented using neural networks and refer to solutions of this problem as neural interactive proofs. First we introduce a unifying framework based on prover-verifier games, which generalises previously proposed interaction protocols. We then describe several new protocols for generating neural interactive proofs, and provide a theoretical comparison of both new and existing approaches. Finally, we support this theory with experiments in two domains: a toy graph isomorphism problem that illustrates the key ideas, and a code validation task using large language models. In so doing, we aim to create a foundation for future work on neural interactive proofs and their application in building safer AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Shi, Chao Peng, Chenyang Xu, Zhengfeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper studies sequential reasoning over graph-structured data, which stands as a fundamental task in various trending fields like automated math problem solving and neural graph algorithm learning, attracting a lot of research interest. Simultaneously managing both sequential and graph-structured information in such tasks presents a notable challenge. Over recent years, many neural architectures in the literature have emerged to tackle the issue. In this work, we generalize the existing architectures and propose a context-enhanced framework. The crucial innovation is that the reasoning of each step does not only rely on the outcome of the preceding step but also leverages the aggregation of information from more historical outcomes. The idea stems from our observation that in sequential graph reasoning, each step's outcome has a much stronger inner connection with each other compared to traditional seq-to-seq tasks. We show that the framework can effectively integrate with the existing methods, enhancing their reasoning abilities. Empirical evaluations are conducted on the challenging CLRS Reasoning Benchmark, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of existing architectures, yielding state-of-the-art results across the majority of the datasets within the benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songjun Tu, Jingbo Sun, Qichao Zhang, Yaocheng Zhang, Jia Liu, Ke Chen, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09125">Goal-Driven Query Answering over First- and Second-Order Dependencies with Equality</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Efthymia Tsamoura, Boris Motik</p>
<p>Abstract: Query answering over data with dependencies plays a central role in most applications of dependencies. The problem is commonly solved by using a suitable variant of the chase algorithm to compute a universal model of the dependencies and the data and thus explicate all knowledge implicit in the dependencies. After this preprocessing step, an arbitrary conjunctive query over the dependencies and the data can be answered by evaluating it the computed universal model. If, however, the query to be answered is fixed and known in advance, computing the universal model is often inefficient as many inferences made during this process can be irrelevant to a given query. In such cases, a goal-driven approach, which avoids drawing unnecessary inferences, promises to be more efficient and thus preferable in practice.
  In this paper we present what we believe to be the first technique for goal-driven query answering over first- and second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. Our technique transforms the input dependencies so that applying the chase to the output avoids many inferences that are irrelevant to the query. The transformation proceeds in several steps, which comprise the following three novel techniques. First, we present a variant of the singularisation technique by Marnette [60] that is applicable to second-order dependencies and that corrects an incompleteness of a related formulation by ten Cate et al. [74]. Second, we present a relevance analysis technique that can eliminate from the input dependencies that provably do not contribute to query answers. Third, we present a variant of the magic sets algorithm [19] that can handle second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. We also present the results of an extensive empirical evaluation, which show that goal-driven query answering can be orders of magnitude faster than computing the full universal model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09237">LMAgent: A Large-scale Multimodal Agents Society for Multi-user Simulation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liu, Wu Liu, Xiaoyan Gu, Yong Rui, Xiaodong He, Yongdong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The believable simulation of multi-user behavior is crucial for understanding complex social systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents have made significant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like intelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often dynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal interactions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we present LMAgent, a very large-scale and multimodal agents society based on multimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents can autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live streaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a self-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal capabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance over the existing multi-agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory mechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system efficiency, which supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on agents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to humans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing LLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are exhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent in credible large-scale social behavior simulations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09264">Speeding up approximate MAP by applying domain knowledge about relevant variables</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Kwisthout, Andrew Schroeder</p>
<p>Abstract: The MAP problem in Bayesian networks is notoriously intractable, even when approximated. In an earlier paper we introduced the Most Frugal Explanation heuristic approach to solving MAP, by partitioning the set of intermediate variables (neither observed nor part of the MAP variables) into a set of relevant variables, which are marginalized out, and irrelevant variables, which will be assigned a sampled value from their domain. In this study we explore whether knowledge about which variables are relevant for a particular query (i.e., domain knowledge) speeds up computation sufficiently to beat both exact MAP as well as approximate MAP while giving reasonably accurate results. Our results are inconclusive, but also show that this probably depends on the specifics of the MAP query, most prominently the number of MAP variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Fan, Luzhen Tang, Huixiao Le, Kejie Shen, Shufang Tan, Yueying Zhao, Yuan Shen, Xinyu Li, Dragan Ga\v{s}evi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: With the continuous development of technological and educational innovation, learners nowadays can obtain a variety of support from agents such as teachers, peers, education technologies, and recently, generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT. The concept of hybrid intelligence is still at a nascent stage, and how learners can benefit from a symbiotic relationship with various agents such as AI, human experts and intelligent learning systems is still unknown. The emerging concept of hybrid intelligence also lacks deep insights and understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hybrid human-AI learning based on strong empirical research. In order to address this gap, we conducted a randomised experimental study and compared learners' motivations, self-regulated learning processes and learning performances on a writing task among different groups who had support from different agents (ChatGPT, human expert, writing analytics tools, and no extra tool). A total of 117 university students were recruited, and their multi-channel learning, performance and motivation data were collected and analysed. The results revealed that: learners who received different learning support showed no difference in post-task intrinsic motivation; there were significant differences in the frequency and sequences of the self-regulated learning processes among groups; ChatGPT group outperformed in the essay score improvement but their knowledge gain and transfer were not significantly different. Our research found that in the absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports still exhibited different self-regulated learning processes, ultimately leading to differentiated performance. What is particularly noteworthy is that AI technologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and potentially trigger metacognitive laziness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09385">AI Predicts AGI: Leveraging AGI Forecasting and Peer Review to Explore LLMs&#x27; Complex Reasoning Capabilities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabrizio Davide, Pietro Torre, Andrea Gaggioli</p>
<p>Abstract: We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030. To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts. This analysis led to the development of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in AGI-related tasks. Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex, uncertain real-world scenarios.</p>

This paper proposes a graph-based language for capturing significantly more complicated structures of higher-order beliefs that agents might have about the rationality of the other agents. The two main contributions are a solution concept that captures the reasoning process based on a given belief structure and an efficient algorithm for compressing any belief structure into a unique minimal form.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, such as o1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks. These systems typically engage in an extended thinking process before responding to a query, allowing them to generate more thorough, accurate, and well-reasoned solutions. These systems are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed. In response, an increasing number of studies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations underlying these powerful reasoning systems. Building on these prior efforts, this paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems. We introduce an "imitate, explore, and self-improve" framework as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode. The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. To verify the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to industry-level reasoning systems on these benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leslie G. Valiant</p>
<p>Abstract: The educability model is a computational model that has been recently proposed to describe the cognitive capability that makes humans unique among existing biological species on Earth in being able to create advanced civilizations. Educability is defined as a capability for acquiring and applying knowledge. It is intended both to describe human capabilities and, equally, as an aspirational description of what can be usefully realized by machines. While the intention is to have a mathematically well-defined computational model, in constructing an instance of the model there are a number of decisions to make. We call these decisions {\it parameters}. In a standard computer, two parameters are the memory capacity and clock rate. There is no universally optimal choice for either one, or even for their ratio. Similarly, in a standard machine learning system, two parameters are the learning algorithm and the dataset used for training. Again, there are no universally optimal choices known for either. An educable system has many more parameters than either of these two kinds of system. This short paper discusses some of the main parameters of educable systems, and the broader implications of their existence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> T. R. Lima</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel mathematical framework for bridging the explanatory gap (Levine, 1983) between consciousness and its physical correlates. Specifically, we propose that qualia correspond to singularities in the mathematical representations of neural network topology. Crucially, we do not claim that qualia are singularities or that singularities "explain" why qualia feel as they do. Instead, we propose that singularities serve as principled, coordinate-invariant markers of points where attempts at purely quantitative description of a system's dynamics reach an in-principle limit. By integrating these formal markers of irreducibility into models of the physical correlates of consciousness, we establish a framework that recognizes qualia as phenomena inherently beyond reduction to complexity, computation, or information. This approach draws on insights from philosophy of mind, mathematics, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI). It does not solve the hard problem of consciousness (Chalmers, 1995), but it advances the discourse by integrating the irreducible nature of qualia into a rigorous, physicalist framework. While primarily theoretical, these insights also open avenues for future AI and artificial consciousness (AC) research, suggesting that recognizing and harnessing irreducible topological features may be an important unlock in moving beyond incremental, scale-based improvements and toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and AC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Zhang, Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Alexander Fabbri, Gabriel Bernadett-Shapiro, Rui Zhang, Prasenjit Mitra, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Indexing is an important step towards strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing methods organize data based on either semantic similarity (similarity) or related information (relatedness), but do not cover both perspectives comprehensively. Our analysis reveals that modeling only one perspective results in insufficient knowledge synthesis, leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning. In this paper, we propose SiReRAG, a novel RAG indexing approach that explicitly considers both similar and related information. On the similarity side, we follow existing work and explore some variances to construct a similarity tree based on recursive summarization. On the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts, groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an average 1.9% improvement in F1 scores. As a reasonably efficient solution, SiReRAG enhances existing reranking methods significantly, with up to 7.8% improvement in average F1 scores.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI evaluations are an important component of the AI governance toolkit, underlying current approaches to safety cases for preventing catastrophic risks. Our paper examines what these evaluations can and cannot tell us. Evaluations can establish lower bounds on AI capabilities and assess certain misuse risks given sufficient effort from evaluators.
  Unfortunately, evaluations face fundamental limitations that cannot be overcome within the current paradigm. These include an inability to establish upper bounds on capabilities, reliably forecast future model capabilities, or robustly assess risks from autonomous AI systems. This means that while evaluations are valuable tools, we should not rely on them as our main way of ensuring AI systems are safe. We conclude with recommendations for incremental improvements to frontier AI safety, while acknowledging these fundamental limitations remain unsolved.</p>

BTs are a popular model for designing agents behavior in robotics and AI. However, as their growth has increased dramatically, the simple model of BTs has come to be limiting. There is a growing push to increase the functionality of BTs, with the end goal of BTs evolving into a programming language in their own right, centred around the defining BT properties of modularity and reactiveness.
  In this paper, we examine how the BT model must be extended in order to grow into such a language. We identify some fundamental problems which must be solved: implementing `reactive' selection, 'monitoring' safety-critical conditions, and passing data between actions. We provide a variety of small examples which demonstrate that these problems are complex, and that current BT approaches do not handle them in a manner consistent with modularity. We instead provide a simple set of modular programming primitives for handling these use cases, and show how they can be combined to build complex programs. We present a full specification for our BT-inspired language, and give an implementation in the functional programming language Haskell. Finally, we demonstrate our language by translating a large and complex BT into a simple, unambiguous program.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning dynamics governing physical and spatiotemporal processes is a challenging problem, especially in scenarios where states are partially measured. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning dynamics governing these systems when parts of the system's states are not measured, specifically when the dynamics generating the non-measured states are unknown. Inspired by state estimation theory and Physics Informed Neural ODEs, we present a sequential optimization framework in which dynamics governing unmeasured processes can be learned. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach leveraging numerical simulations and a real dataset extracted from an electro-mechanical positioning system. We show how the underlying equations fit into our formalism and demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method when compared with baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Freinberger, Julian Lemmel, Radu Grosu, Sofiene Jerbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have demonstrated the potential of quantum learning models based on parametrized quantum circuits as an alternative to deep learning models. On the one hand, these findings have shown the ultimate exponential speed-ups in learning that full-blown quantum models can offer in certain -- artificially constructed -- environments. On the other hand, they have demonstrated the ability of experimentally accessible PQCs to solve OpenAI Gym benchmarking tasks. However, it remains an open question whether these near-term QRL techniques can be successfully applied to more complex problems exhibiting high-dimensional observation spaces. In this work, we bridge this gap and present a hybrid model combining a PQC with classical feature encoding and post-processing layers that is capable of tackling Atari games. A classical model, subjected to architectural restrictions similar to those present in the hybrid model is constructed to serve as a reference. Our numerical investigation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model is capable of solving the Pong environment and achieving scores comparable to the classical reference in Breakout. Furthermore, our findings shed light on important hyperparameter settings and design choices that impact the interplay of the quantum and classical components. This work contributes to the understanding of near-term quantum learning models and makes an important step towards their deployment in real-world RL scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miltiadis Kofinas, Samuele Papa, Efstratios Gavves</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural fields (NeFs) have recently emerged as a state-of-the-art method for encoding spatio-temporal signals of various modalities. Despite the success of NeFs in reconstructing individual signals, their use as representations in downstream tasks, such as classification or segmentation, is hindered by the complexity of the parameter space and its underlying symmetries, in addition to the lack of powerful and scalable conditioning mechanisms. In this work, we draw inspiration from the principles of connectionism to design a new architecture based on MLPs, which we term NeoMLP. We start from an MLP, viewed as a graph, and transform it from a multi-partite graph to a complete graph of input, hidden, and output nodes, equipped with high-dimensional features. We perform message passing on this graph and employ weight-sharing via self-attention among all the nodes. NeoMLP has a built-in mechanism for conditioning through the hidden and output nodes, which function as a set of latent codes, and as such, NeoMLP can be used straightforwardly as a conditional neural field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fitting high-resolution signals, including multi-modal audio-visual data. Furthermore, we fit datasets of neural representations, by learning instance-specific sets of latent codes using a single backbone architecture, and then use them for downstream tasks, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Zhang, Ollie Liu, Tianyu Yu, Jinyi Hu, Willie Neiswanger</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress in recent years, yet continue to struggle with low-level visual perception (LLVP) -- particularly the ability to accurately describe the geometric details of an image. This capability is crucial for applications in areas such as robotics, medical image analysis, and manufacturing. In this paper, we first introduce Geoperception, a benchmark designed to evaluate an MLLM's ability to accurately transcribe 2D geometric information from an image. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate the limitations of leading MLLMs, and then conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore strategies for improving their performance on geometric tasks. Our findings highlight the benefits of certain model architectures, training techniques, and data strategies, including the use of high-fidelity synthetic data and multi-stage training with a data curriculum. Notably, we find that a data curriculum enables models to learn challenging geometry understanding tasks which they fail to learn from scratch. Leveraging these insights, we develop Euclid, a family of models specifically optimized for strong low-level geometric perception. Although purely trained on synthetic multimodal data, Euclid shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry shapes. For instance, Euclid outperforms the best closed-source model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, by up to 58.56% on certain Geoperception benchmark tasks and 10.65% on average across all tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atalay Mert Ileri, Nalen Rangarajan, Jack Cannell, Hande McGinty</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been instrumental in advancing the development of ontologies and knowledge graphs, providing a structured framework that enhances the semantic integration of data. However, the reliability of deductive reasoning within these systems remains challenging, as evidenced by inconsistencies among popular reasoners in recent competitions. This evidence underscores the limitations of current testing-based methodologies, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we have developed VEL, a formally verified EL++ reasoner equipped with machine-checkable correctness proofs that ensure the validity of outputs across all possible inputs. This formalization, based on the algorithm of Baader et al., has been transformed into executable OCaml code using the Coq proof assistant's extraction capabilities. Our formalization revealed several errors in the original completeness proofs, which led to changes to the algorithm to ensure its completeness. Our work demonstrates the necessity of mechanization of reasoning algorithms to ensure their correctness at theoretical and implementation levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udari Madhushani Sehwag, Kassiani Papasotiriou, Jared Vann, Sumitra Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for representing and reasoning over structured information, supporting a wide range of applications such as information retrieval, question answering, and decision-making. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by incompleteness, limiting their potential for real-world impact. While knowledge graph completion (KGC) has been extensively studied in the literature, recent advances in generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have introduced new opportunities for innovation. In-context learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for leveraging pretrained knowledge of LLMs across a range of natural language processing tasks and has been widely adopted in both academia and industry. However, how to utilize in-context learning for effective KGC remains relatively underexplored. We develop a novel method that incorporates topological information through in-context learning to enhance KGC performance. By integrating ontological knowledge and graph structure into the context of LLMs, our approach achieves strong performance in the transductive setting i.e., nodes in the test graph dataset are present in the training graph dataset. Furthermore, we apply our approach to KGC in the more challenging inductive setting, i.e., nodes in the training graph dataset and test graph dataset are disjoint, leveraging the ontology to infer useful information about missing nodes which serve as contextual cues for the LLM during inference. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines on the ILPC-small and ILPC-large datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Yu Tang, Ning Dai, Tianshuo Zhou, David H. Mathews, Liang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of RNA design given a target structure aims to find a sequence that can fold into that structure. It is a computationally hard problem where some version(s) have been proven to be NP-hard. As a result, heuristic methods such as local search have been popular for this task, but by only exploring a fixed number of candidates. They can not keep up with the exponential growth of the design space, and often perform poorly on longer and harder-to-design structures. We instead formulate these discrete problems as continuous optimization, which starts with a distribution over all possible candidate sequences, and uses gradient descent to improve the expectation of an objective function. We define novel distributions based on coupled variables to rule out invalid sequences given the target structure and to model the correlation between nucleotides. To make it universally applicable to any objective function, we use sampling to approximate the expected objective function, to estimate the gradient, and to select the final candidate. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our work consistently outperforms them in key metrics such as Boltzmann probability, ensemble defect, and energy gap, especially on long and hard-to-design puzzles in the Eterna100 benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Stein, Andrew Arash Mahyari, Guillermo Francia, Eman El-Sheikh</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinem Coleri, Aysun Gurur Onalan, Marco di Renzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional wireless network design relies on optimization algorithms derived from domain-specific mathematical models, which are often inefficient and unsuitable for dynamic, real-time applications due to high complexity. Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome complexity and adaptability concerns, but it faces challenges such as accuracy issues, delays, and limited interpretability due to its inherent black-box nature. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates optimization theory with deep learning methodologies to address these issues. The methodology starts by constructing the block diagram of the optimization theory-based solution, identifying key building blocks corresponding to optimality conditions and iterative solutions. Selected building blocks are then replaced with deep neural networks, enhancing the adaptability and interpretability of the system. Extensive simulations show that this hybrid approach not only reduces runtime compared to optimization theory based approaches but also significantly improves accuracy and convergence rates, outperforming pure deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Wang, Hong Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) utilizing instruction-following data, such as LLaVA, have achieved great progress in the industry. A major limitation in these models is that visual tokens consume a substantial portion of the maximum token limit in large language models (LLMs), leading to increased computational demands and decreased performance when prompts include multiple images or videos. Industry solutions often mitigate this issue by increasing computational power, but this approach is less feasible in academic environments with limited resources. In this study, we propose Dynamic Feature Map Reduction (DFMR) based on LLaVA-1.5 to address the challenge of visual token overload. DFMR dynamically compresses the visual tokens, freeing up token capacity. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating DFMR into LLaVA-1.5 significantly improves the performance of LLaVA in varied visual token lengths, offering a promising solution for extending LLaVA to handle multi-image and video scenarios in resource-constrained academic environments and it can also be applied in industry settings for data augmentation to help mitigate the scarcity of open-domain image-text pair datasets in the continued pretraining stage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Li, Yusen Zhang, Rui Zhang, Snigdha Chaturvedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) measures whether a system can generate a summary fairly representing information from documents with different social attribute values. Fairness in MDS is crucial since a fair summary can offer readers a comprehensive view. Previous works focus on quantifying summary-level fairness using Proportional Representation, a fairness measure based on Statistical Parity. However, Proportional Representation does not consider redundancy in input documents and overlooks corpus-level unfairness. In this work, we propose a new summary-level fairness measure, Equal Coverage, which is based on coverage of documents with different social attribute values and considers the redundancy within documents. To detect the corpus-level unfairness, we propose a new corpus-level measure, Coverage Parity. Our human evaluations show that our measures align more with our definition of fairness. Using our measures, we evaluate the fairness of thirteen different LLMs. We find that Claude3-sonnet is the fairest among all evaluated LLMs. We also find that almost all LLMs overrepresent different social attribute values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Li, Xiaoyang Wang, Dawei Cheng, Cong Chen, Ying Zhang, Xuemin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Data generation is a fundamental research problem in data management due to its diverse use cases, ranging from testing database engines to data-specific applications. However, real-world entities often involve complex interactions that cannot be effectively modeled by traditional tabular data. Therefore, graph data generation has attracted increasing attention recently. Although various graph generators have been proposed in the literature, there are three limitations: i) They cannot capture the co-evolution pattern of graph structure and node attributes. ii) Few of them consider edge direction, leading to substantial information loss. iii) Current state-of-the-art dynamic graph generators are based on the temporal random walk, making the simulation process time-consuming. To fill the research gap, we introduce VRDAG, a novel variational recurrent framework for efficient dynamic attributed graph generation. Specifically, we design a bidirectional message-passing mechanism to encode both directed structural knowledge and attribute information of a snapshot. Then, the temporal dependency in the graph sequence is captured by a recurrence state updater, generating embeddings that can preserve the evolution pattern of early graphs. Based on the hidden node embeddings, a conditional variational Bayesian method is developed to sample latent random variables at the neighboring timestep for new snapshot generation. The proposed generation paradigm avoids the time-consuming path sampling and merging process in existing random walk-based methods, significantly reducing the synthesis time. Finally, comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.</p>

This paper presents Kajal, a novel approach that automatically infers grammar from DSL code snippets by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through prompt engineering and few-shot learning.

Our experiments show that Kajal achieves 60% accuracy with few-shot learning and 45% without it, demonstrating the significant impact of few-shot learning on the tool's effectiveness. This approach offers a promising solution for automating DSL grammar extraction, and future work will explore using smaller, open-source LLMs and testing on larger datasets to further validate Kajal's performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Quantum-Train-Based Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Dist-QTRL), a novel approach to addressing the scalability challenges of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) by integrating quantum computing principles. Quantum-Train Reinforcement Learning (QTRL) leverages parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently generate neural network parameters, achieving a \(poly(\log(N))\) reduction in the dimensionality of trainable parameters while harnessing quantum entanglement for superior data representation. The framework is designed for distributed multi-agent environments, where multiple agents, modeled as Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), operate in parallel, enabling faster convergence and enhanced scalability. Additionally, the Dist-QTRL framework can be extended to high-performance computing (HPC) environments by utilizing distributed quantum training for parameter reduction in classical neural networks, followed by inference using classical CPUs or GPUs. This hybrid quantum-HPC approach allows for further optimization in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Dist-QTRL framework and explore its convergence properties, supported by empirical results demonstrating performance improvements over centric QTRL models. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced RL in tackling complex, high-dimensional tasks, particularly in distributed computing settings, where our framework achieves significant speedups through parallelization without compromising model accuracy. This work paves the way for scalable, quantum-enhanced RL systems in practical applications, leveraging both quantum and classical computational resources.</p>

In this paper, we explore how open-source LLMs make judgments on diverse categories of cultural values across countries, and its relation to training methodology such as model sizes, training corpus, alignment, etc. Our analysis shows that LLMs can judge socio-cultural norms similar to humans but less so on social systems and progress. In addition, LLMs tend to judge cultural values biased toward Western culture, which can be improved with training on the multilingual corpus. We also find that increasing model size helps a better understanding of social values, but smaller models can be enhanced by using synthetic data. Our analysis reveals valuable insights into the design methodology of LLMs in connection with their understanding of cultural values.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event cameras provide a compelling alternative to traditional frame-based sensors, capturing dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and low latency. Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geon Yeong Park, Sang Wan Lee, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion distillation models effectively accelerate reverse sampling by compressing the process into fewer steps. However, these models still exhibit a performance gap compared to their pre-trained diffusion model counterparts, exacerbated by distribution shifts and accumulated errors during multi-step sampling. To address this, we introduce Distillation++, a novel inference-time distillation framework that reduces this gap by incorporating teacher-guided refinement during sampling. Inspired by recent advances in conditional sampling, our approach recasts student model sampling as a proximal optimization problem with a score distillation sampling loss (SDS). To this end, we integrate distillation optimization during reverse sampling, which can be viewed as teacher guidance that drives student sampling trajectory towards the clean manifold using pre-trained diffusion models. Thus, Distillation++ improves the denoising process in real-time without additional source data or fine-tuning. Distillation++ demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art distillation baselines, particularly in early sampling stages, positioning itself as a robust guided sampling process crafted for diffusion distillation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hans Moen, Vishnu Raj, Andrius Vabalas, Markus Perola, Samuel Kaski, Andrea Ganna, Pekka Marttinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Health registers contain rich information about individuals' health histories. Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Hui Chen, Guanxiong Shen, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to address the issue of limited data samples for the deployment of pre-trained models in unseen environments, this paper proposes a residual channel-based data augmentation strategy for Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI), coupled with a lightweight SimSiam contrastive learning framework. By applying least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimations followed by equalization, signals with different residual channel effects are generated. These residual channels enable the model to learn more effective representations. Then the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with 1% samples in a novel environment for RFFI. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both feature extraction ability and generalization while requiring fewer samples and less time, making it suitable for practical wireless security applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter N. Loxley</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning solves optimal control and sequential decision problems widely found in control systems engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. This work investigates optimal control over a sequence of natural images. The problem is formalized, and general conditions are derived for an image to be sufficient for implementing an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning is shown to be efficient only for certain types of image representations. This is demonstrated by developing a reinforcement learning benchmark that scales easily with number of states and length of horizon, and has optimal policies that are easily distinguished from suboptimal policies. Image representations given by overcomplete sparse codes are found to be computationally efficient for optimal control, using fewer computational resources to learn and evaluate optimal policies. For natural images of fixed size, representing each image as an overcomplete sparse code in a linear network is shown to increase network storage capacity by orders of magnitude beyond that possible for any complete code, allowing larger tasks with many more states to be solved. Sparse codes can be generated by devices with low energy requirements and low computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwangryeol Park, Seulki Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose SMMF (Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization), a memory-efficient optimizer that reduces the memory requirement of the widely used adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as Adam, by up to 96%. SMMF enables flexible and efficient factorization of an arbitrary rank (shape) of the first and second momentum tensors during optimization, based on the proposed square-matricization and one-time single matrix factorization. From this, it becomes effectively applicable to any rank (shape) of momentum tensors, i.e., bias, matrix, and any rank-d tensors, prevalent in various deep model architectures, such as CNNs (high rank) and Transformers (low rank), in contrast to existing memory-efficient optimizers that applies only to a particular (rank-2) momentum tensor, e.g., linear layers. We conduct a regret bound analysis of SMMF, which shows that it converges similarly to non-memory-efficient adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as AdamNC, providing a theoretical basis for its competitive optimization capability. In our experiment, SMMF takes up to 96% less memory compared to state-of-the-art memory efficient optimizers, e.g., Adafactor, CAME, and SM3, while achieving comparable model performance on various CNN and Transformer tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Xiao, Lei Shi, Peng Liu, Zhe Wang, Chenjia Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for alleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches rely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional knowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with radiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists are inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize report fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this problem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization (MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which can be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference vector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the RRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product between the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward.Next,the RRG model is optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward via RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors from the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted multi-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire preference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with specific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to different preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present phi-4, a 14-billion parameter language model developed with a training recipe that is centrally focused on data quality. Unlike most language models, where pre-training is based primarily on organic data sources such as web content or code, phi-4 strategically incorporates synthetic data throughout the training process. While previous models in the Phi family largely distill the capabilities of a teacher model (specifically GPT-4), phi-4 substantially surpasses its teacher model on STEM-focused QA capabilities, giving evidence that our data-generation and post-training techniques go beyond distillation. Despite minimal changes to the phi-3 architecture, phi-4 achieves strong performance relative to its size -- especially on reasoning-focused benchmarks -- due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the post-training scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijun Li, Hilaf Hasson, Jing Hu, Joydeep Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across these diverse objectives. However, it often involves a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (GCSL) method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. The need for complex architectures and optimization constraints can be naturally eliminated. MOGCSL benefits from filtering out uninformative or noisy instances that do not achieve desirable long-term rewards. It also incorporates a novel goal-choosing algorithm to model and select "high" achievable goals for inference.
  While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts. Specifically, extensive experiments conducted on real-world recommendation datasets validate its efficacy and efficiency. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pusen Dong, Tianchen Zhu, Yue Qiu, Haoyi Zhou, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lulu Zhao, Weihao Zeng, Xiaofeng Shi, Hua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, LoRA has emerged as a crucial technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained models, yet its performance in multi-task learning scenarios often falls short. In contrast, the MoE architecture presents a natural solution to this issue. However, it introduces challenges such as mutual interference of data across multiple domains and knowledge forgetting of various tasks. Additionally, MoE significantly increases the number of parameters, posing a computational cost challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MoSLD, a mixture-of-shared-LoRAs model with a dropout strategy. MoSLD addresses these challenges by sharing the upper projection matrix in LoRA among different experts, encouraging the model to learn general knowledge across tasks, while still allowing the lower projection matrix to focus on the unique features of each task. The application of dropout alleviates the imbalanced update of parameter matrix and mitigates parameter overfitting in LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits excellent performance in both single-task and multi-task scenarios, with robust out-of-domain generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Yao, Zichen Liu, Zhenyu Cui, Yuxin Peng, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Vision Mamba (Vim) models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks in a computationally efficient manner, attributed to their unique design of selective state space models. To further extend their applicability to diverse downstream vision tasks, Vim models can be adapted using the efficient fine-tuning technique known as visual prompting. However, existing visual prompting methods are predominantly tailored for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models that leverage global attention, neglecting the distinctive sequential token-wise compression and propagation characteristics of Vim. Specifically, existing prompt tokens prefixed to the sequence are insufficient to effectively activate the input and forget gates across the entire sequence, hindering the extraction and propagation of discriminative information. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Selective Visual Prompting (SVP) method specifically for the efficient fine-tuning of Vim. To prevent the loss of discriminative information during state space propagation, SVP employs lightweight selective prompters for token-wise prompt generation, ensuring adaptive activation of the update and forget gates within Mamba blocks to promote discriminative information propagation. Moreover, considering that Vim propagates both shared cross-layer information and specific inner-layer information, we further refine SVP with a dual-path structure: Cross-Prompting and Inner-Prompting. Cross-Prompting utilizes shared parameters across layers, while Inner-Prompting employs distinct parameters, promoting the propagation of both shared and specific information, respectively. Extensive experimental results on various large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed SVP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Frames Per Second (FPS) significantly affects the gaming experience. Providing players with accurate FPS estimates prior to purchase benefits both players and game developers. However, we have a limited understanding of how to predict a game's FPS performance on a specific device. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of factors that may affect game FPS on a global-scale dataset to identify the determinants of FPS. This includes player-side and game-side characteristics, as well as country-level socio-economic statistics. Furthermore, recognizing that accurate FPS predictions require extensive user data, which raises privacy concerns, we propose a federated learning-based model to ensure user privacy. Each player and game is assigned a unique learnable knowledge kernel that gradually extracts latent features for improved accuracy. We also introduce a novel training and prediction scheme that allows these kernels to be dynamically plug-and-play, effectively addressing cold start issues. To train this model with minimal bias, we collected a large telemetry dataset from 224 countries and regions, 100,000 users, and 835 games. Our model achieved a mean Wasserstein distance of 0.469 between predicted and ground truth FPS distributions, outperforming all baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ji, Xuetao Tian, Ye Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality large-scale labeled datasets poses a huge challenge for employing deep learning models in video deception detection. To address this issue, inspired by the psychological theory on the relation between deception and expressions, we propose a novel method called AFFAKT in this paper, which enhances the classification performance by transferring useful and correlated knowledge from a large facial expression dataset. Two key challenges in knowledge transfer arise: 1) \textit{how much} knowledge of facial expression data should be transferred and 2) \textit{how to} effectively leverage transferred knowledge for the deception classification model during inference. Specifically, the optimal relation mapping between facial expression classes and deception samples is firstly quantified using proposed H-OTKT module and then transfers knowledge from the facial expression dataset to deception samples. Moreover, a correlation prototype within another proposed module SRKB is well designed to retain the invariant correlations between facial expression classes and deception classes through momentum updating. During inference, the transferred knowledge is fine-tuned with the correlation prototype using a sample-specific re-weighting strategy. Experimental results on two deception detection datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. The interpretability study reveals high associations between deception and negative affections, which coincides with the theory in psychology.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces RuleArena, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex, real-world rules in reasoning. Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. These results highlight significant challenges in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-modal contrastive distillation has recently been explored for learning effective 3D representations. However, existing methods focus primarily on modality-shared features, neglecting the modality-specific features during the pre-training process, which leads to suboptimal representations. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of current contrastive methods for 3D representation learning and propose a new framework, namely CMCR, to address these shortcomings. Our approach improves upon traditional methods by better integrating both modality-shared and modality-specific features. Specifically, we introduce masked image modeling and occupancy estimation tasks to guide the network in learning more comprehensive modality-specific features. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal unified codebook that learns an embedding space shared across different modalities. Besides, we introduce geometry-enhanced masked image modeling to further boost 3D representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates the challenges faced by traditional approaches and consistently outperforms existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor performance on this task.

<p>Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are typically trained on datasets with limited exposure to Scientific, Technical and Educational domains. Translation models thus, in general, struggle with tasks that involve scientific understanding or technical jargon. Their performance is found to be even worse for low-resource Indian languages. Finding a translation dataset that tends to these domains in particular, poses a difficult challenge. In this paper, we address this by creating a multilingual parallel corpus containing more than 2.8 million rows of English-to-Indic and Indic-to-Indic high-quality translation pairs across 8 Indian languages. We achieve this by bitext mining human-translated transcriptions of NPTEL video lectures. We also finetune and evaluate NMT models using this corpus and surpass all other publicly available models at in-domain tasks. We also demonstrate the potential for generalizing to out-of-domain translation tasks by improving the baseline by over 2 BLEU on average for these Indian languages on the Flores+ benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Ding, Ting Zhang, Yiran Li, Jieming Shi, Chen Jason Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Organic Solar Cells (OSCs) are a promising technology for sustainable energy production. However, the identification of molecules with desired OSC properties typically involves laborious experimental research. To accelerate progress in the field, it is crucial to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the properties of OSC molecules. While graph representation learning has demonstrated success in molecular property prediction, it remains underexplored for OSC-specific tasks. Existing methods fail to capture the unique structural features of OSC molecules, particularly the intricate ring systems that critically influence OSC properties, leading to suboptimal performance. To fill the gap, we present RingFormer, a novel graph transformer framework specially designed to capture both atom and ring level structural patterns in OSC molecules. RingFormer constructs a hierarchical graph that integrates atomic and ring structures and employs a combination of local message passing and global attention mechanisms to generate expressive graph representations for accurate OSC property prediction. We evaluate RingFormer's effectiveness on five curated OSC molecule datasets through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that RingFormer consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving a 22.77% relative improvement over the nearest competitor on the CEPDB dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhoulin Ji, Chenhao Lin, Hang Wang, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting synthetic from real speech is increasingly crucial due to the risks of misinformation and identity impersonation. While various datasets for synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research. To fill this gap, we propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic, synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score. These results highlight the model's robust capability for a comprehensive analysis of synthetic speech, offering a promising avenue for future research and practical applications in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocong Rao, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is a challenging task with significant value in many scenarios. Existing skeleton-based methods typically assume virtual motion relations between all joints, and adopt average joint or sequence representations for learning. However, they rarely explore key body structure and motion such as gait to focus on more important body joints or limbs, while lacking the ability to fully mine valuable spatial-temporal sub-patterns of skeletons to enhance model learning. This paper presents a generic Motif guided graph transformer with Combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (MoCos) that exploits structure-specific and gait-related body relations as well as combinatorial features of skeleton graphs to learn effective skeleton representations for person re-ID. In particular, motivated by the locality within joints' structure and the body-component collaboration in gait, we first propose the motif guided graph transformer (MGT) that incorporates hierarchical structural motifs and gait collaborative motifs, which simultaneously focuses on multi-order local joint correlations and key cooperative body parts to enhance skeleton relation learning. Then, we devise the combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (CSP) that leverages random spatial-temporal combinations of joint nodes and skeleton graphs to generate diverse sub-skeleton and sub-tracklet representations, which are contrasted with the most representative features (prototypes) of each identity to learn class-related semantics and discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of MoCos over existing state-of-the-art models. We further show its generality under RGB-estimated skeletons, different graph modeling, and unsupervised scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenna Lai, Haoran Xie, Guandong Xu, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) presents significant challenges due to the absence of salient cue words. Previous methods have struggled with insufficient data and limited reasoning capabilities to infer underlying opinions. Integrating multi-task learning (MTL) with large language models (LLMs) offers the potential to enable models of varying sizes to reliably perceive and recognize genuine opinions in ISA. However, existing MTL approaches are constrained by two sources of uncertainty: data-level uncertainty, arising from hallucination problems in LLM-generated contextual information, and task-level uncertainty, stemming from the varying capacities of models to process contextual information. To handle these uncertainties, we introduce MT-ISA, a novel MTL framework that enhances ISA by leveraging the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs through automatic MTL. Specifically, MT-ISA constructs auxiliary tasks using generative LLMs to supplement sentiment elements and incorporates automatic MTL to fully exploit auxiliary data. We introduce data-level and task-level automatic weight learning (AWL), which dynamically identifies relationships and prioritizes more reliable data and critical tasks, enabling models of varying sizes to adaptively learn fine-grained weights based on their reasoning capabilities. We investigate three strategies for data-level AWL, while also introducing homoscedastic uncertainty for task-level AWL. Extensive experiments reveal that models of varying sizes achieve an optimal balance between primary prediction and auxiliary tasks in MT-ISA. This underscores the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanqi Yang, Mingzhe Li, Mingda Han, Zhenjiang Li, Weitao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedded IoT system development is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity and functionality across a wide range of applications. However, such a complex process requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence often necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform for general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise to automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods include a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware dependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain knowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful deployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four mainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental results show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and complete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop baselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively. We also show EmbedGenius's potential through case studies in environmental monitoring and remote control systems development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenni Bi, Kai Han, Chuanjian Liu, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a challenge. While existing methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT utilizes sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction and learning from past mistakes, as well as consensus-guided decision making strategies to optimize correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: This position paper discusses the benefits of longitudinal behavioural research with customised AI tools for exploring the opportunities and risks of synthetic relationships. Synthetic relationships are defined as "continuing associations between humans and AI tools that interact with one another wherein the AI tool(s) influence(s) humans' thoughts, feelings, and/or actions." (Starke et al., 2024). These relationships can potentially improve health, education, and the workplace, but they also bring the risk of subtle manipulation and privacy and autonomy concerns. To harness the opportunities of synthetic relationships and mitigate their risks, we outline a methodological approach that complements existing findings. We propose longitudinal research designs with self-assembled AI agents that enable the integration of detailed behavioural and self-reported data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Liu, Jihai Zhang, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Min Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Shen, Yake Wei, Jianxiong Yin, Deepu Rajan, Di Hu, Simon See</p>
<p>Abstract: Training multimodal models requires a large amount of labeled data. Active learning (AL) aim to reduce labeling costs. Most AL methods employ warm-start approaches, which rely on sufficient labeled data to train a well-calibrated model that can assess the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled data. However, when assembling a dataset, labeled data are often scarce initially, leading to a cold-start problem. Additionally, most AL methods seldom address multimodal data, highlighting a research gap in this field. Our research addresses these issues by developing a two-stage method for Multi-Modal Cold-Start Active Learning (MMCSAL).
  Firstly, we observe the modality gap, a significant distance between the centroids of representations from different modalities, when only using cross-modal pairing information as self-supervision signals. This modality gap affects data selection process, as we calculate both uni-modal and cross-modal distances. To address this, we introduce uni-modal prototypes to bridge the modality gap. Secondly, conventional AL methods often falter in multimodal scenarios where alignment between modalities is overlooked. Therefore, we propose enhancing cross-modal alignment through regularization, thereby improving the quality of selected multimodal data pairs in AL. Finally, our experiments demonstrate MMCSAL's efficacy in selecting multimodal data pairs across three multimodal datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of digital platforms has led to an increasing reliance on technology-driven, home-based healthcare solutions, enabling individuals to monitor their health and share information with healthcare professionals as needed. However, creating an efficient care plan management system requires more than just analyzing hospital summaries and Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Factors such as individual user needs and social determinants of health, including living conditions and the flow of healthcare information between different settings, must also be considered. Challenges in this complex healthcare network involve schema diversity (in EHRs, personal health records, etc.) and terminology diversity (e.g., ICD, SNOMED-CT) across ancillary healthcare operations. Establishing interoperability among various systems and applications is crucial, with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) emphasizing the need for patient-centric access and control of healthcare data. In this paper, we propose an integrated ontological model, the Common Semantic Data Model for Social Determinants of Health (CSSDH), by combining ISO/DIS 13940:2024 ContSys with WHO Social Determinants of Health. CSSDH aims to achieve interoperability within the Continuity of Care Network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Bhargav Rongali, Mohamad Hassan N C, Ankit Jha, Neha Bhargava, Saurabh Prasad, Biplab Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the intricate challenge of video question-answering (VideoQA). Despite notable progress, current methods fall short of effectively integrating questions with video frames and semantic object-level abstractions to create question-aware video representations. We introduce Local-Global Question Aware Video Embedding (LGQAVE), which incorporates three major innovations to integrate multi-modal knowledge better and emphasize semantic visual concepts relevant to specific questions. LGQAVE moves beyond traditional ad-hoc frame sampling by utilizing a cross-attention mechanism that precisely identifies the most relevant frames concerning the questions. It captures the dynamics of objects within these frames using distinct graphs, grounding them in question semantics with the miniGPT model. These graphs are processed by a question-aware dynamic graph transformer (Q-DGT), which refines the outputs to develop nuanced global and local video representations. An additional cross-attention module integrates these local and global embeddings to generate the final video embeddings, which a language model uses to generate answers. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LGQAVE significantly outperforms existing models in delivering accurate multi-choice and open-ended answers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmentation models are typically constrained by the categories defined during training. To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets.
  This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks require identifying the relationship between sentence pairs, typically classified as entailment, contradiction, or neutrality. While the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, Entailment Few-Shot Learning (EFL), achieves a 93.1% accuracy on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, further advancements are constrained by the dataset's limitations. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging synthetic data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity and complexity. We present UnitedSynT5, an advanced extension of EFL that leverages a T5-based generator to synthesize additional premise-hypothesis pairs, which are rigorously cleaned and integrated into the training data. These augmented examples are processed within the EFL framework, embedding labels directly into hypotheses for consistency. We train a GTR-T5-XL model on this expanded dataset, achieving a new benchmark of 94.7% accuracy on the SNLI dataset, 94.01% accuracy on the E-SNLI dataset, and 92.57% accuracy on the MultiNLI dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA models. This research demonstrates the potential of synthetic data augmentation in improving NLI models, offering a path forward for further advancements in natural language understanding tasks.</p>

In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google Gemini 1, to serve as automatic evaluators for non-standardized metrics in summarization and dialog-based tasks.

Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the LLM evaluator by using perturbed inputs. Our findings suggest that while LLMs show promise, their alignment with human evaluators is limited, they are not robust against perturbations and significant improvements are required for their standalone use as reliable evaluators for subjective metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video generation has evolved rapidly in recent years, delivering remarkable results. Training typically relies on video-caption paired data, which plays a crucial role in enhancing generation performance. However, current video captions often suffer from insufficient details, hallucinations and imprecise motion depiction, affecting the fidelity and consistency of generated videos. In this work, we propose a novel instance-aware structured caption framework, termed InstanceCap, to achieve instance-level and fine-grained video caption for the first time. Based on this scheme, we design an auxiliary models cluster to convert original video into instances to enhance instance fidelity. Video instances are further used to refine dense prompts into structured phrases, achieving concise yet precise descriptions. Furthermore, a 22K InstanceVid dataset is curated for training, and an enhancement pipeline that tailored to InstanceCap structure is proposed for inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstanceCap significantly outperform previous models, ensuring high fidelity between captions and videos while reducing hallucinations.</p>

These actions are subsequently mapped to environmental contexts via imitation learning, enabling robots to learn new skills effectively. Experimental evaluations in the MetaWorld simulation environments demonstrate the pipeline's capability to generate high-fidelity and reliable demonstrations. Using the generated demonstrations, various skill learning algorithms achieve an accomplishment rate three times the original on novel tasks.

One of the most popular methods being Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). This method assigns local relevance based on the pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. With the rise of attribution method research, there has emerged a pressing need to assess and evaluate their performance. Numerous metrics have been proposed, each assessing an individual property of attribution methods such as faithfulness, robustness or localization. Unfortunately, no single metric is deemed optimal for every case, and researchers often use several metrics to test the quality of the attribution maps. In this work, we address the shortcomings of the current LRP formulations and introduce a novel method for determining the relevance of input neurons through layer-wise relevance propagation. Furthermore, we apply this approach to the recently developed Vision Transformer architecture and evaluate its performance against existing methods on two image classification datasets, namely ImageNet and PascalVOC. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method. Furthermore, we discuss the insufficiencies of current evaluation metrics for attribution-based explainability and propose a new evaluation metric that combines the notions of faithfulness, robustness and contrastiveness. We utilize this new metric to evaluate the performance of various attribution-based methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/davor10105/relative-absolute-magnitude-propagation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Fernandez, Suzan Awinat</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the abundance of current researches working on the sentiment analysis from videos and audios, finding the best model that gives the highest accuracy rate is still considered a challenge for researchers in this field. The main objective of this paper is to prove the usability of emotion recognition models that take video and audio inputs. The datasets used to train the models are the CREMA-D dataset for audio and the RAVDESS dataset for video. The fine-tuned models that been used are: Facebook/wav2vec2-large for audio and the Google/vivit-b-16x2-kinetics400 for video. The avarage of the probabilities for each emotion generated by the two previous models is utilized in the decision making framework. After disparity in the results, if one of the models gets much higher accuracy, another test framework is created. The methods used are the Weighted Average method, the Confidence Level Threshold method, the Dynamic Weighting Based on Confidence method, and the Rule-Based Logic method. This limited approach gives encouraging results that make future research into these methods viable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liu, Abdellah Fourtassi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Gao, Qinglong Cao, Yuntian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is essential in various domains, and recent advancements in diffusion-based TSF models have shown considerable promise. However, these models typically adopt traditional diffusion patterns, treating TSF as a noise-based conditional generation task. This approach neglects the inherent continuous sequential nature of time series, leading to a fundamental misalignment between diffusion mechanisms and the TSF objective, thereby severely impairing performance. To bridge this misalignment, and inspired by the classic Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) theory, which views time series as continuous sequential progressions evolving from previous data points, we propose a novel Auto-Regressive Moving Diffusion (ARMD) model to first achieve the continuous sequential diffusion-based TSF. Unlike previous methods that start from white Gaussian noise, our model employs chain-based diffusion with priors, accurately modeling the evolution of time series and leveraging intermediate state information to improve forecasting accuracy and stability. Specifically, our approach reinterprets the diffusion process by considering future series as the initial state and historical series as the final state, with intermediate series generated using a sliding-based technique during the forward process. This design aligns the diffusion model's sampling procedure with the forecasting objective, resulting in an unconditional, continuous sequential diffusion TSF model. Extensive experiments conducted on seven widely used datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing diffusion-based TSF models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Li, Yun Liu, Guolei Sun, Min Wu, Le Zhang, Ce Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation in videos has been a focal point of recent research. However, existing models encounter challenges when faced with unfamiliar categories. To address this, we introduce the Open Vocabulary Video Semantic Segmentation (OV-VSS) task, designed to accurately segment every pixel across a wide range of open-vocabulary categories, including those that are novel or previously unexplored. To enhance OV-VSS performance, we propose a robust baseline, OV2VSS, which integrates a spatial-temporal fusion module, allowing the model to utilize temporal relationships across consecutive frames. Additionally, we incorporate a random frame enhancement module, broadening the model's understanding of semantic context throughout the entire video sequence. Our approach also includes video text encoding, which strengthens the model's capability to interpret textual information within the video context. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as VSPW and Cityscapes highlight OV-VSS's zero-shot generalization capabilities, especially in handling novel categories. The results validate OV2VSS's effectiveness, demonstrating improved performance in semantic segmentation tasks across diverse video datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhyeok Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Human cultural complexity did not arise in a vacuum. Scholars in the humanities and social sciences have long debated how ecological factors, such as climate and resource availability, enabled early hunter-gatherers to allocate time and energy beyond basic subsistence tasks. This paper presents a formal, interdisciplinary approach that integrates theoretical modeling with computational methods to examine whether conditions that allow lower spoilage of stored food, often associated with colder climates and abundant large fauna, could indirectly foster the emergence of cultural complexity. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a mathematical framework that relates spoilage rates, yield levels, resource management skills, and cultural activities. Under this framework, we prove that lower spoilage and adequate yields reduce the frequency of hunting, thus freeing substantial time for cultural pursuits. Second, we implement a reinforcement learning simulation, inspired by engineering optimization techniques, to validate the theoretical predictions. By training agents in different $(Y,p)$ environments, where $Y$ is yield and $p$ is the probability of daily spoilage, we observe patterns consistent with the theoretical model: stable conditions with lower spoilage strongly correlate with increased cultural complexity. While we do not claim to replicate prehistoric social realities directly, our results suggest that ecologically stable niches provided a milieu in which cultural forms could germinate and evolve. This study, therefore, offers an integrative perspective that unites humanistic inquiries into the origins of culture with the formal rigor and exploratory power of computational modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fiorenzo Parascandolo, Nicholas Moratelli, Enver Sangineto, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Alberte Fern\'andez-Castro, Roberto Navigli</p>
<p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of associating a word in a given context with its most suitable meaning among a set of possible candidates. While the task has recently witnessed renewed interest, with systems achieving performances above the estimated inter-annotator agreement, at the time of writing it still struggles to find downstream applications. We argue that one of the reasons behind this is the difficulty of applying WSD to plain text. Indeed, in the standard formulation, models work under the assumptions that a) all the spans to disambiguate have already been identified, and b) all the possible candidate senses of each span are provided, both of which are requirements that are far from trivial. In this work, we present a new task called Word Sense Linking (WSL) where, given an input text and a reference sense inventory, systems have to both identify which spans to disambiguate and then link them to their most suitable meaning.We put forward a transformer-based architecture for the task and thoroughly evaluate both its performance and those of state-of-the-art WSD systems scaled to WSL, iteratively relaxing the assumptions of WSD. We hope that our work will foster easier integration of lexical semantics into downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglin Wang, Yucheng Zhou, Zijie Zhai, Jianbing Shen, Kai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein inverse folding is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics, aiming to recover the amino acid sequences from a given protein backbone structure. Despite the success of existing methods, they struggle to fully capture the intricate inter-residue relationships critical for accurate sequence prediction. We propose a novel method that leverages diffusion models with representation alignment (DMRA), which enhances diffusion-based inverse folding by (1) proposing a shared center that aggregates contextual information from the entire protein structure and selectively distributes it to each residue; and (2) aligning noisy hidden representations with clean semantic representations during the denoising process. This is achieved by predefined semantic representations for amino acid types and a representation alignment method that utilizes type embeddings as semantic feedback to normalize each residue. In experiments, we conduct extensive evaluations on the CATH4.2 dataset to demonstrate that DMRA outperforms leading methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and exhibiting strong generalization capabilities on the TS50 and TS500 datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of green energy, the efficiency and reliability of wind turbines are key to sustainable renewable energy production. For that reason, this paper presents a novel intelligent system architecture designed for the dynamic collection and real-time processing of visual data to detect defects in wind turbines. The system employs advanced algorithms within a distributed framework to enhance inspection accuracy and efficiency using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated visual and thermal sensors. An experimental study conducted at the "Staryi Sambir-1" wind power plant in Ukraine demonstrates the system's effectiveness, showing a significant improvement in defect detection accuracy (up to 94%) and a reduction in inspection time per turbine (down to 1.5 hours) compared to traditional methods. The results show that the proposed intelligent system architecture provides a scalable and reliable solution for wind turbine maintenance, contributing to the durability and performance of renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zhou, Ke Zhu, Jianxin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential in transferring dark knowledge from a large teacher to a small student network, such that the student can be much more efficient than the teacher but with comparable accuracy. Existing KD methods, however, rely on a large teacher trained specifically for the target task, which is both very inflexible and inefficient. In this paper, we argue that a SSL-pretrained model can effectively act as the teacher and its dark knowledge can be captured by the coordinate system or linear subspace where the features lie in. We then need only one forward pass of the teacher, and then tailor the coordinate system (TCS) for the student network. Our TCS method is teacher-free and applies to diverse architectures, works well for KD and practical few-shot learning, and allows cross-architecture distillation with large capacity gap. Experiments show that TCS achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art KD methods, while only requiring roughly half of their training time and GPU memory costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Zhaohui Hou, Mingjie Zhan, Shihao Han, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based video generation models have achieved significant success. However, existing models often suffer from issues like weak consistency and declining image quality over time. To overcome these challenges, inspired by aesthetic principles, we propose a non-invasive plug-in called Uniform Frame Organizer (UFO), which is compatible with any diffusion-based video generation model. The UFO comprises a series of adaptive adapters with adjustable intensities, which can significantly enhance the consistency between the foreground and background of videos and improve image quality without altering the original model parameters when integrated. The training for UFO is simple, efficient, requires minimal resources, and supports stylized training. Its modular design allows for the combination of multiple UFOs, enabling the customization of personalized video generation models. Furthermore, the UFO also supports direct transferability across different models of the same specification without the need for specific retraining. The experimental results indicate that UFO effectively enhances video generation quality and demonstrates its superiority in public video generation benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Mutliagent Path Finding (MAPF) problem consists of identifying the trajectories that a set of agents should follow inside a given network in order to reach their desired destinations as soon as possible, but without colliding with each other. We aim to minimize the maximum time any agent takes to reach their goal, ensuring optimal path length. In this work, we complement a recent thread of results that aim to systematically study the algorithmic behavior of this problem, through the parameterized complexity point of view.
  First, we show that MAPF is NP-hard when the given network has a star-like topology (bounded vertex cover number) or is a tree with $11$ leaves. Both of these results fill important gaps in our understanding of the tractability of this problem that were left untreated in the recent work of [Fioravantes et al. Exact Algorithms and Lowerbounds for Multiagent Path Finding: Power of Treelike Topology. AAAI'24]. Nevertheless, our main contribution is an exact algorithm that scales well as the input grows (FPT) when the topology of the given network is highly centralized (bounded distance to clique). This parameter is significant as it mirrors real-world networks. In such environments, a bunch of central hubs (e.g., processing areas) are connected to only few peripheral nodes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilei Zhao, Wentao Zhang, Tingran Yang, Yong Jiang, Fei Huang, Wei Yang Bryan Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since classical machine learning has become a powerful tool for developing data-driven algorithms, quantum machine learning is expected to similarly impact the development of quantum algorithms. The literature reflects a mutually beneficial relationship between machine learning and quantum computing, where progress in one field frequently drives improvements in the other. Motivated by the fertile connection between machine learning and quantum computing enabled by parameterized quantum circuits, we use a resource-efficient and scalable Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Network (SQQNN) for both regression and classification tasks. The SQQNN leverages parameterized single-qubit unitary operators and quantum measurements to achieve efficient learning. To train the model, we use gradient descent for regression tasks. For classification, we introduce a novel training method inspired by the Taylor series, which can efficiently find a global minimum in a single step. This approach significantly accelerates training compared to iterative methods. Evaluated across various applications, the SQQNN exhibits virtually error-free and strong performance in regression and classification tasks, including the MNIST dataset. These results demonstrate the versatility, scalability, and suitability of the SQQNN for deployment on near-term quantum devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content and sophisticated video editing tools has made it both important and challenging to moderate digital platforms. Video watermarking addresses these challenges by embedding imperceptible signals into videos, allowing for identification. However, the rare open tools and methods often fall short on efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. To reduce these gaps, this paper introduces Video Seal, a comprehensive framework for neural video watermarking and a competitive open-sourced model. Our approach jointly trains an embedder and an extractor, while ensuring the watermark robustness by applying transformations in-between, e.g., video codecs. This training is multistage and includes image pre-training, hybrid post-training and extractor fine-tuning. We also introduce temporal watermark propagation, a technique to convert any image watermarking model to an efficient video watermarking model without the need to watermark every high-resolution frame. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in terms of speed, imperceptibility, and robustness. Video Seal achieves higher robustness compared to strong baselines especially under challenging distortions combining geometric transformations and video compression. Additionally, we provide new insights such as the impact of video compression during training, and how to compare methods operating on different payloads. Contributions in this work - including the codebase, models, and a public demo - are open-sourced under permissive licenses to foster further research and development in the field.</p>

However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paria Rashidinejad, Yuandong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human preferences typically suffers from the infamous reward hacking problem, where optimization of an imperfect reward model leads to undesired behaviors. In this paper, we investigate reward hacking in offline preference optimization, which aims to improve an initial model using a preference dataset. We identify two types of reward hacking stemming from statistical fluctuations in the dataset: Type I Reward Hacking due to subpar choices appearing more favorable, and Type II Reward Hacking due to decent choices appearing less favorable. We prove that many (mainstream or theoretical) preference optimization methods suffer from both types of reward hacking. To mitigate Type I Reward Hacking, we propose POWER, a new preference optimization method that combines Guiasu's weighted entropy with a robust reward maximization objective. POWER enjoys finite-sample guarantees under general function approximation, competing with the best covered policy in the data. To mitigate Type II Reward Hacking, we analyze the learning dynamics of preference optimization and develop a novel technique that dynamically updates preference labels toward certain "stationary labels", resulting in diminishing gradients for untrustworthy samples. Empirically, POWER with dynamic labels (POWER-DL) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on alignment benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 13.0 points on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 11.5 points on Arena-Hard over DPO, while also improving or maintaining performance on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. Strong theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the promise of POWER-DL in mitigating reward hacking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Gera, Odellia Boni, Yotam Perlitz, Roy Bar-Haim, Lilach Eden, Asaf Yehudai</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb Stam, Emily Saldanha, Mahantesh Halappanavar, Anurag Acharya</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant rise in the spread of misinformation on online platforms such as Twitter. Oftentimes this growth is blamed on the idea of the "echo chamber." However, the behavior said to characterize these echo chambers exists in two dimensions. The first is in a user's social interactions, where they are said to stick with the same clique of like-minded users. The second is in the content of their posts, where they are said to repeatedly espouse homogeneous ideas. In this study, we link the two by using Twitter's network of retweets to study social interactions and topic modeling to study tweet content. In order to measure the diversity of a user's interactions over time, we develop a novel metric to track the speed at which they travel through the social network. The application of these analysis methods to misinformation-focused data from the pandemic demonstrates correlation between social behavior and tweet content. We believe this correlation supports the common intuition about how antisocial users behave, and further suggests that it holds even in subcommunities already rife with misinformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Mandal, Xiaojun Lin, R. Srikant</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation, where a small student model learns from a pre-trained large teacher model, has achieved substantial empirical success since the seminal work of \citep{hinton2015distilling}. Despite prior theoretical studies exploring the benefits of knowledge distillation, an important question remains unanswered: why does soft-label training from the teacher require significantly fewer neurons than directly training a small neural network with hard labels? To address this, we first present motivating experimental results using simple neural network models on a binary classification problem. These results demonstrate that soft-label training consistently outperforms hard-label training in accuracy, with the performance gap becoming more pronounced as the dataset becomes increasingly difficult to classify. We then substantiate these observations with a theoretical contribution based on two-layer neural network models. Specifically, we show that soft-label training using gradient descent requires only $O\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2 \epsilon}\right)$ neurons to achieve a classification loss averaged over epochs smaller than some $\epsilon > 0$, where $\gamma$ is the separation margin of the limiting kernel. In contrast, hard-label training requires $O\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^4} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ neurons, as derived from an adapted version of the gradient descent analysis in \citep{ji2020polylogarithmic}. This implies that when $\gamma \leq \epsilon$, i.e., when the dataset is challenging to classify, the neuron requirement for soft-label training can be significantly lower than that for hard-label training. Finally, we present experimental results on deep neural networks, further validating these theoretical findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating AI systems that can interact with environments over long periods, similar to human cognition, has been a longstanding research goal. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules. This project simulates human-like cognition, enabling multimodal large language models to provide continuous and adaptive service over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhui Huang, Wenzhao Zheng, Yuan Gao, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) have received extensive attention recently and serve as promising candidates for general-purpose large vision models. While they can only generate short videos each time, existing methods achieve long video generation by iteratively calling the VGMs, using the last-frame output as the condition for the next-round generation. However, the last frame only contains short-term fine-grained information about the scene, resulting in inconsistency in the long horizon. To address this, we propose an Omni World modeL (Owl-1) to produce long-term coherent and comprehensive conditions for consistent long video generation. As videos are observations of the underlying evolving world, we propose to model the long-term developments in a latent space and use VGMs to film them into videos. Specifically, we represent the world with a latent state variable which can be decoded into explicit video observations. These observations serve as a basis for anticipating temporal dynamics which in turn update the state variable. The interaction between evolving dynamics and persistent state enhances the diversity and consistency of the long videos. Extensive experiments show that Owl-1 achieves comparable performance with SOTA methods on VBench-I2V and VBench-Long, validating its ability to generate high-quality video observations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xizi Wang, Feng Cheng, Ziyang Wang, Huiyu Wang, Md Mohaiminul Islam, Lorenzo Torresani, Mohit Bansal, Gedas Bertasius, David Crandall</p>
<p>Abstract: Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges.

<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has received increasing attention due to its potential to learn from large amounts of data. However, most existing methods are still open-loop and suffer from weak scalability, lack of high-order interactions, and inefficient decision-making. In this paper, we explore a closed-loop framework for autonomous driving and propose a large Driving wOrld modEl (Doe-1) for unified perception, prediction, and planning. We formulate autonomous driving as a next-token generation problem and use multi-modal tokens to accomplish different tasks. Specifically, we use free-form texts (i.e., scene descriptions) for perception and generate future predictions directly in the RGB space with image tokens. For planning, we employ a position-aware tokenizer to effectively encode action into discrete tokens. We train a multi-modal transformer to autoregressively generate perception, prediction, and planning tokens in an end-to-end and unified manner. Experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Doe-1 in various tasks including visual question-answering, action-conditioned video generation, and motion planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Ciatto, Andrea Agiollo, Matteo Magnini, Andrea Omicini</p>
<p>Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junghun Kim, Ka Hyun Park, Hoyoung Yoon, U Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an edge-incomplete graph, how can we accurately find the missing links? The link prediction in edge-incomplete graphs aims to discover the missing relations between entities when their relationships are represented as a graph. Edge-incomplete graphs are prevalent in real-world due to practical limitations, such as not checking all users when adding friends in a social network. Addressing the problem is crucial for various tasks, including recommending friends in social networks and finding references in citation networks. However, previous approaches rely heavily on the given edge-incomplete (observed) graph, making it challenging to consider the missing (unobserved) links during training. In this paper, we propose PULL (PU-Learning-based Link predictor), an accurate link prediction method based on the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. PULL treats the observed edges in the training graph as positive examples, and the unconnected node pairs as unlabeled ones. PULL effectively prevents the link predictor from overfitting to the observed graph by proposing latent variables for every edge, and leveraging the expected graph structure with respect to the variables. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PULL consistently outperforms the baselines for predicting links in edge-incomplete graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning tasks are generally formulated as optimization problems, where one searches for an optimal function within a certain functional space. In practice, parameterized functional spaces are considered, in order to be able to perform gradient descent. Typically, a neural network architecture is chosen and fixed, and its parameters (connection weights) are optimized, yielding an architecture-dependent result. This way of proceeding however forces the evolution of the function during training to lie within the realm of what is expressible with the chosen architecture, and prevents any optimization across architectures. Costly architectural hyper-parameter optimization is often performed to compensate for this. Instead, we propose to adapt the architecture on the fly during training. We show that the information about desirable architectural changes, due to expressivity bottlenecks when attempting to follow the functional gradient, can be extracted from backpropagation. To do this, we propose a mathematical definition of expressivity bottlenecks, which enables us to detect, quantify and solve them while training, by adding suitable neurons. Thus, while the standard approach requires large networks, in terms of number of neurons per layer, for expressivity and optimization reasons, we provide tools and properties to develop an architecture starting with a very small number of neurons. As a proof of concept, we show results~on the CIFAR dataset, matching large neural network accuracy, with competitive training time, while removing the need for standard architectural hyper-parameter search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) significantly enhances the zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). While coding data is known to boost LLM reasoning abilities during pretraining, its role in activating internal reasoning capacities during IFT remains understudied. This paper investigates a key question: How does coding data impact LLMs' reasoning capacities during IFT stage? To explore this, we thoroughly examine the impact of coding data across different coding data proportions, model families, sizes, and reasoning domains, from various perspectives. Specifically, we create three IFT datasets with increasing coding data proportions, fine-tune six LLM backbones across different families and scales on these datasets, evaluate the tuned models' performance across twelve tasks in three reasoning domains, and analyze the outcomes from three broad-to-granular perspectives: overall, domain-level, and task-specific. Our holistic analysis provides valuable insights into each perspective. First, coding data tuning enhances the overall reasoning capabilities of LLMs across different model families and scales. Moreover, while the impact of coding data varies by domain, it shows consistent trends within each domain across different model families and scales. Additionally, coding data generally provides comparable task-specific benefits across model families, with optimal proportions in IFT datasets being task-dependent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compute-efficient training of language models has become an important issue. We consider data pruning for data-efficient training of LLMs. In this work, we consider a data pruning method based on information entropy. We propose that the samples in the training corpus be ranked in terms of their informativeness which we estimate through entropy functions. The key idea is that, less informative samples are likely to contain redundant information, and thus should be pruned first. We use the entropy functions based on the negative log-likelihood and the average inverse word frequency of a sample as a surrogate to measure its informativeness. Experiments reveal that the proposed information-based pruning can improve upon various language modeling and downstream tasks, and enhance the generalization capability of language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods struggle with the non-stationarity of multi-agent systems and fail to adaptively learn online when tested with novel agents. Here, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to create an autonomous agent that can handle these challenges. Our agent, Hypothetical Minds, consists of a cognitively-inspired architecture, featuring modular components for perception, memory, and hierarchical planning over two levels of abstraction. We introduce the Theory of Mind module that scaffolds the high-level planning process by generating hypotheses about other agents' strategies in natural language. It then evaluates and iteratively refines these hypotheses by reinforcing hypotheses that make correct predictions about the other agents' behavior. Hypothetical Minds significantly improves performance over previous LLM-agent and RL baselines on a range of competitive, mixed motive, and collaborative domains in the Melting Pot benchmark, including both dyadic and population-based environments. Additionally, comparisons against LLM-agent baselines and ablations reveal the importance of hypothesis evaluation and refinement for succeeding on complex scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony C. Constantinou, Neville K. Kitson, Alessio Zanga</p>
<p>Abstract: Since its introduction to the public, ChatGPT has had an unprecedented impact. While some experts praised AI advancements and highlighted their potential risks, others have been critical about the accuracy and usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we are interested in the ability of LLMs to identify causal relationships. We focus on the well-established GPT-4 (Turbo) and evaluate its performance under the most restrictive conditions, by isolating its ability to infer causal relationships based solely on the variable labels without being given any other context by humans, demonstrating the minimum level of effectiveness one can expect when it is provided with label-only information. We show that questionnaire participants judge the GPT-4 graphs as the most accurate in the evaluated categories, closely followed by knowledge graphs constructed by domain experts, with causal Machine Learning (ML) far behind. We use these results to highlight the important limitation of causal ML, which often produces causal graphs that violate common sense, affecting trust in them. However, we show that pairing GPT-4 with causal ML overcomes this limitation, resulting in graphical structures learnt from real data that align more closely with those identified by domain experts, compared to structures learnt by causal ML alone. Overall, our findings suggest that despite GPT-4 not being explicitly designed to reason causally, it can still be a valuable tool for causal representation, as it improves the causal discovery process of causal ML algorithms that are designed to do just that.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Shi, Muning Wen, Qi Zhang, Weinan Zhang, Cunjia Liu, Weiru Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has revolutionized decision-making processes in dynamic environments, yet it often struggles with autonomously detecting and achieving goals without clear feedback signals. For example, in a Source Term Estimation problem, the lack of precise environmental information makes it challenging to provide clear feedback signals and to define and evaluate how the source's location is determined. To address this challenge, the Autonomous Goal Detection and Cessation (AGDC) module was developed, enhancing various RL algorithms by incorporating a self-feedback mechanism for autonomous goal detection and cessation upon task completion. Our method effectively identifies and ceases undefined goals by approximating the agent's belief, significantly enhancing the capabilities of RL algorithms in environments with limited feedback. To validate effectiveness of our approach, we integrated AGDC with deep Q-Network, proximal policy optimization, and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms, and evaluated its performance on the Source Term Estimation problem. The experimental results showed that AGDC-enhanced RL algorithms significantly outperformed traditional statistical methods such as infotaxis, entrotaxis, and dual control for exploitation and exploration, as well as a non-statistical random action selection method. These improvements were evident in terms of success rate, mean traveled distance, and search time, highlighting AGDC's effectiveness and efficiency in complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Wang, Kun Sun, Jonas Kuhn</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often struggle with spatial reasoning. This paper presents a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities through iterative feedback between LLMs and Answer Set Programming (ASP). We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting baseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with iterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP pipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82% accuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and 8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key innovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning through a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and ASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that addresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose Facts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance on complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis across different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini) demonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability, contributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alona Strugatski, Giora Alexandron</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics. We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI for social impact (AI4SI) offers significant potential for addressing complex societal challenges in areas such as public health, agriculture, education, conservation, and public safety. However, existing AI4SI research is often labor-intensive and resource-demanding, limiting its accessibility and scalability; the standard approach is to design a (base-level) system tailored to a specific AI4SI problem. We propose the development of a novel meta-level multi-agent system designed to accelerate the development of such base-level systems, thereby reducing the computational cost and the burden on social impact domain experts and AI researchers. Leveraging advancements in foundation models and large language models, our proposed approach focuses on resource allocation problems providing help across the full AI4SI pipeline from problem formulation over solution design to impact evaluation. We highlight the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying such systems and emphasize the importance of a human-in-the-loop approach to ensure the responsible and effective application of AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Although there have been significant advancements in related vision-language benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in embodied environments. To address this gap, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate ELBA on the TEACh vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during the training process that can effectively generalize to test samples, even in the presence of distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm has highlighted the significant benefits of using unlabeled data to train self-adapted models prior to inference. In this survey, we categorize TTA into several distinct groups based on the form of test data, namely, test-time domain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, and online test-time adaptation. For each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms and discuss various learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant applications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueping Gong, Wei You, Jiheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning has emerged as an effective approach to accelerate learning by integrating knowledge from related source agents. However, challenges arise due to data heterogeneity-such as differences in feature sets or incomplete datasets-which often results in the nonidentifiability of causal effects. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in partially observable contextual bandits, where agents operate with incomplete information and limited access to hidden confounders. To address the challenges posed by unobserved confounders, we formulate optimization problems to derive tight bounds on the nonidentifiable causal effects. We then propose an efficient method that discretizes the functional constraints of unknown distributions into linear constraints, allowing us to sample compatible causal models through a sequential process of solving linear programs. This method takes into account estimation errors and exhibits strong convergence properties, ensuring robust and reliable causal bounds. Leveraging these causal bounds, we improve classical bandit algorithms, achieving tighter regret upper and lower bounds relative to the sizes of action sets and function spaces. In tasks involving function approximation, which are crucial for handling complex context spaces, our method significantly improves the dependence on function space size compared to previous work. We formally prove that our causally enhanced algorithms outperform classical bandit algorithms, achieving notably faster convergence rates. The applicability of our approach is further illustrated through an example of offline pricing policy learning with censored demand.Simulations confirm the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to enhance contextual bandit agents in real-world applications, especially when data is scarce, costly, or restricted due to privacy concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joar Skalse, Lucy Farnik, Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Erik Jenner, Adam Gleave, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to solve a task using reinforcement learning, it is necessary to first formalise the goal of that task as a reward function. However, for many real-world tasks, it is very difficult to manually specify a reward function that never incentivises undesirable behaviour. As a result, it is increasingly popular to use reward learning algorithms, which attempt to learn a reward function from data. However, the theoretical foundations of reward learning are not yet well-developed. In particular, it is typically not known when a given reward learning algorithm with high probability will learn a reward function that is safe to optimise. This means that reward learning algorithms generally must be evaluated empirically, which is expensive, and that their failure modes are difficult to anticipate in advance. One of the roadblocks to deriving better theoretical guarantees is the lack of good methods for quantifying the difference between reward functions. In this paper we provide a solution to this problem, in the form of a class of pseudometrics on the space of all reward functions that we call STARC (STAndardised Reward Comparison) metrics. We show that STARC metrics induce both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case regret, which implies that our metrics are tight, and that any metric with the same properties must be bilipschitz equivalent to ours. Moreover, we also identify a number of issues with reward metrics proposed by earlier works. Finally, we evaluate our metrics empirically, to demonstrate their practical efficacy. STARC metrics can be used to make both theoretical and empirical analysis of reward learning algorithms both easier and more principled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuntai Du, Yuhan Liu, Yitian Hao, Qizheng Zhang, Haodong Wang, Yuyang Huang, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Junchen Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning inference on streaming media data, such as object detection in video or LiDAR feeds and text extraction from audio waves, is now ubiquitous. To achieve high inference accuracy, these applications typically require significant network bandwidth to gather high-fidelity data and extensive GPU resources to run deep neural networks (DNNs). While the high demand for network bandwidth and GPU resources could be substantially reduced by optimally adapting the configuration knobs, such as video resolution and frame rate, current adaptation techniques fail to meet three requirements simultaneously: adapt configurations (i) with minimum extra GPU or bandwidth overhead; (ii) to reach near-optimal decisions based on how the data affects the final DNN's accuracy, and (iii) do so for a range of configuration knobs. This paper presents OneAdapt, which meets these requirements by leveraging a gradient-ascent strategy to adapt configuration knobs. The key idea is to embrace DNNs' differentiability to quickly estimate the accuracy's gradient to each configuration knob, called AccGrad. Specifically, OneAdapt estimates AccGrad by multiplying two gradients: InputGrad (i.e. how each configuration knob affects the input to the DNN) and DNNGrad (i.e. how the DNN input affects the DNN inference output). We evaluate OneAdapt across five types of configurations, four analytic tasks, and five types of input data. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptation schemes, OneAdapt cuts bandwidth usage and GPU usage by 15-59% while maintaining comparable accuracy or improves accuracy by 1-5% while using equal or fewer resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fashion design is a challenging and complex process.Recent works on fashion generation and editing are all agnostic of the actual fashion design process, which limits their usage in practice.In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical diffusion-based framework tailored for fashion design, coined as HieraFashDiff. Our model is designed to mimic the practical fashion design workflow, by unraveling the denosing process into two successive stages: 1) an ideation stage that generates design proposals given high-level concepts and 2) an iteration stage that continuously refines the proposals using low-level attributes. Our model supports fashion design generation and fine-grained local editing in a single framework. To train our model, we contribute a new dataset of full-body fashion images annotated with hierarchical text descriptions. Extensive evaluations show that, as compared to prior approaches, our method can generate fashion designs and edited results with higher fidelity and better prompt adherence, showing its promising potential to augment the practical fashion design workflow.

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving model training across decentralized devices. However, it faces challenges such as statistical heterogeneity and susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which can impact model robustness and fairness. Personalized FL attempts to provide some relief by customizing models for individual clients. However, it falls short in addressing server-side aggregation vulnerabilities. We introduce a novel method called \textbf{FedAA}, which optimizes client contributions via \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{A}ggregation to enhance model robustness against malicious clients and ensure fairness across participants in non-identically distributed settings. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach involving a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based algorithm for continuous control of aggregation weights, an innovative client selection method based on model parameter distances, and a reward mechanism guided by validation set performance. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that, in terms of robustness, \textbf{FedAA} outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable levels of fairness, offering a promising solution to build resilient and fair federated systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhong Zheng, Xiaoyan Bai, Xueshen Liu, Z. Morley Mao, Beidi Chen, Fan Lai, Atul Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Zhengyan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xiyu Shi, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Guangli Li, Tao Yang, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Wenyi Tan, Tingrui Wang, Xinkai Liang, Quan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to neural rendering, specifically tailored for adversarial camouflage, within an extensive 3D rendering framework. Our method, named FPA, goes beyond traditional techniques by faithfully simulating lighting conditions and material variations, ensuring a nuanced and realistic representation of textures on a 3D target. To achieve this, we employ a generative approach that learns adversarial patterns from a diffusion model. This involves incorporating a specially designed adversarial loss and covert constraint loss to guarantee the adversarial and covert nature of the camouflage in the physical world. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed camouflage in sticker mode, demonstrating its ability to cover the target without compromising adversarial information. Through empirical and physical experiments, FPA exhibits strong performance in terms of attack success rate and transferability. Additionally, the designed sticker-mode camouflage, coupled with a concealment constraint, adapts to the environment, yielding diverse styles of texture. Our findings highlight the versatility and efficacy of the FPA approach in adversarial camouflage applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangsheng Bao, Hongbo Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Linyi Yang, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Zong, Yuyan Chen, Weiming Lu, Jian Shao, Yongfeng Huang, Heng Chang, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated efficacy in various linguistic applications, including question answering and controlled text generation. However, studies into their ability to switch between opposite styles of responses in professional domains remain underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach, named ProSwitch, which enables a language model to switch between professional and non-professional answers, by tuning and evaluating through the guidance of domain and style knowledge. ProSwitch unfolds in three phases: LLM-augmented preparation to collect domain knowledge and QA pairs, instruction tuning to optimize LLMs with multiple levels of knowledge, and comprehensive evaluation to assess both style discrimination and reference-based quality of the generated text. Comparative analysis of ProSwitch against general and specialized LLMs reveals that our approach outperforms baselines in switching between professional and non-professional responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongge Han, Trevor McInroe, Adam Jelley, Stefano V. Albrecht, Peter Bell, Amos Storkey</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaohao Yuan, Songyou Li, Geyan Ye, Yikun Zhang, Long-Kai Huang, Wenbing Huang, Wei Liu, Jianhua Yao, Yu Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation, PAAG, a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a significant increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 22.0% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model. We anticipate that PAAG will broaden the horizons of protein design by leveraging the knowledge from between textual annotation and proteins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Wei, Liqian Ma, Rui Chen, Weiye Zhao, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force compliance; some tasks require avoidance of certain regions, while others require convergence to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging, impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based, hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis, generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable real-time execution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocong Rao, Minlin Zeng, Xuejiao Zhao, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> N\'uria Armengol Urp\'i, Marco Bagatella, Marin Vlastelica, Georg Martius</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline data are both valuable and practical resources for teaching robots complex behaviors. Ideally, learning agents should not be constrained by the scarcity of available demonstrations, but rather generalize beyond the training distribution. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios typically requires huge amounts of data to prevent neural network policies from picking up on spurious correlations and learning non-causal relationships. We propose CAIAC, a data augmentation method that can create feasible synthetic transitions from a fixed dataset without having access to online environment interactions. By utilizing principled methods for quantifying causal influence, we are able to perform counterfactual reasoning by swapping $\it{action}$-unaffected parts of the state-space between independent trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness of offline learning algorithms against distributional shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhang Zhou, Zijian Feng, Zixiao Zhu, Junlang Qian, Kezhi Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness, i.e., sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alameen Najjar</p>
<p>Abstract: We empirically demonstrate that a transformer pre-trained on country-scale unlabeled human mobility data learns embeddings capable, through fine-tuning, of developing a deep understanding of the target geography and its corresponding mobility patterns. Utilizing an adaptation framework, we evaluate the performance of our pre-trained embeddings in encapsulating a broad spectrum of concepts directly and indirectly related to human mobility. This includes basic notions, such as geographic location and distance, and extends to more complex constructs, such as administrative divisions and land cover. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals a substantial performance boost gained from pre-training, reaching up to 38% in tasks such as tree-cover regression. We attribute this result to the ability of the pre-training to uncover meaningful patterns hidden in the raw data, beneficial for modeling relevant high-level concepts. The pre-trained embeddings emerge as robust representations of regions and trajectories, potentially valuable for a wide range of downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devichand Budagam, Ashutosh Kumar, Mahsa Khoshnoodi, Sankalp KJ, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT utilizes the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), which structures five unique prompting strategies in a hierarchical order based on their cognitive requirement on LLMs when compared to human mental capabilities. It assesses the complexity of tasks with the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI), which demonstrates the cognitive competencies of LLMs across diverse datasets and offers insights into the cognitive demands that datasets place on different LLMs. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of an LLMs problem solving abilities and the intricacy of a dataset, offering a standardized metric for task complexity. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that HPF enhances LLM performance by 2% to 63% compared to baseline performance, with GSM8k being the most cognitively complex task among reasoning and coding tasks with an average HPI of 3.20 confirming the effectiveness of HPT. To support future research and reproducibility in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Kundu, Aritra Sarkar, Abhishek Sadhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks. However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2 to 5 times higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.</p>

<p>Abstract: The complexity of financial data, characterized by its variability and low signal-to-noise ratio, necessitates advanced methods in quantitative investment that prioritize both performance and interpretability.Transitioning from early manual extraction to genetic programming, the most advanced approach in the alpha factor mining domain currently employs reinforcement learning to mine a set of combination factors with fixed weights. However, the performance of resultant alpha factors exhibits inconsistency, and the inflexibility of fixed factor weights proves insufficient in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage formulaic alpha generating framework AlphaForge, for alpha factor mining and factor combination. This framework employs a generative-predictive neural network to generate factors, leveraging the robust spatial exploration capabilities inherent in deep learning while concurrently preserving diversity. The combination model within the framework incorporates the temporal performance of factors for selection and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each component alpha factor. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms contemporary benchmarks in formulaic alpha factor mining. Furthermore, our model exhibits a notable enhancement in portfolio returns within the realm of quantitative investment and real money investment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enterprises have a growing need to identify relevant tables in data lakes; e.g. tables that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. Tabular neural models can be helpful for such data discovery tasks. In this paper, we present TabSketchFM, a neural tabular model for data discovery over data lakes. First, we propose novel pre-training: a sketch-based approach to enhance the effectiveness of data discovery in neural tabular models. Second, we finetune the pretrained model for identifying unionable, joinable, and subset table pairs and show significant improvement over previous tabular neural models. Third, we present a detailed ablation study to highlight which sketches are crucial for which tasks. Fourth, we use these finetuned models to perform table search; i.e., given a query table, find other tables in a corpus that are unionable, joinable, or that are subsets of the query. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in F1 scores for search compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we show significant transfer across datasets and tasks establishing that our model can generalize across different tasks and over different data lakes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a fundamental problem in the evaluation of large language models that we call training on the test task. Unlike wrongful practices like training on the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task is not a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of practices that utilize knowledge about evaluation tasks at training time. We demonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. We argue that the seeming superiority of one model family over another may be explained by a different degree of training on the test task. To this end, we propose an effective method to adjust for the effect of training on the test task on benchmark evaluations. Put simply, to fine-tune each model under comparison on the same task-relevant data before evaluation. We then show that instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models train on the test task. Our work promotes a new perspective on the evaluation of large language models with broad implications for benchmarking and the study of emergent capabilities</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has relied on specific combinations of herbs in prescriptions to treat various symptoms and signs for thousands of years. Predicting TCM prescriptions poses a fascinating technical challenge with significant practical implications. However, this task faces limitations due to the scarcity of high-quality clinical datasets and the complex relationship between symptoms and herbs. To address these issues, we introduce \textit{DigestDS}, a novel dataset comprising practical medical records from experienced experts in digestive system diseases. We also propose a method, TCM-FTP (TCM Fine-Tuning Pre-trained), to leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) via supervised fine-tuning on \textit{DigestDS}. Additionally, we enhance computational efficiency using a low-rank adaptation technique. Moreover, TCM-FTP incorporates data augmentation by permuting herbs within prescriptions, exploiting their order-agnostic nature. Impressively, TCM-FTP achieves an F1-score of 0.8031, significantly outperforming previous methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates remarkable accuracy in dosage prediction, achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.0604. In contrast, LLMs without fine-tuning exhibit poor performance. Although LLMs have demonstrated wide-ranging capabilities, our work underscores the necessity of fine-tuning for TCM prescription prediction and presents an effective way to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of ML models in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and security has intensified the need for robust data security, model integrity, and reliable outputs. Large multimodal foundational models, while crucial for complex tasks, present challenges in scalability, reliability, and potential misuse. Decentralized systems offer a solution by distributing workload and mitigating central points of failure, but they introduce risks of unauthorized access to sensitive data across nodes. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework designed for responsible AI development. Our approach incorporates: 1) Zero-knowledge proofs for secure model verification, enhancing trust without compromising privacy. 2) Consensus-based verification checks to ensure consistent outputs across nodes, mitigating hallucinations and maintaining model integrity. 3) Split Learning techniques that segment models across different nodes, preserving data privacy by preventing full data access at any point. 4) Hardware-based security through trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect data and computations. This framework aims to enhance security and privacy and improve the reliability and fairness of multimodal AI systems. Promoting efficient resource utilization contributes to more sustainable AI development. Our state-of-the-art proofs and principles demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in responsibly democratizing artificial intelligence, offering a promising approach for building secure and private foundational models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Ma, Bo Zhang, Bo Xu, Jian Wang, Hongfei Lin, Xiao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathetic response generation, aiming to understand the user's situation and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human-like dialogue systems. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective during training, yet fail to align the empathy levels between generated and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation framework using reinforcement learning (EmpRL). The framework develops an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further fine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between generated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms -- emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration -- is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy, enabling the generation of empathetic responses. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework significantly improves the quality of generated responses, enhances the similarity in empathy levels between generated and target responses, and produces empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Tim Z. Xiao, Katherine M. Collins, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Adrian Weller, Michael J. Black, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is an urgent need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer different-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in numerous tasks and applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs using high-quality datasets under external supervision remains prohibitively expensive. In response, LLM self-improvement approaches have been vibrantly developed recently. The typical paradigm of LLM self-improvement involves training LLM on self-generated data, part of which may be detrimental and should be filtered out due to the unstable data quality. While current works primarily employs filtering strategies based on answer correctness, in this paper, we demonstrate that filtering out correct but with high distribution shift extent (DSE) samples could also benefit the results of self-improvement. Given that the actual sample distribution is usually inaccessible, we propose a new metric called DS weight to approximate DSE, inspired by the Importance Weighting methods. Consequently, we integrate DS weight with self-consistency to comprehensively filter the self-generated samples and fine-tune the language model. Experiments show that with only a tiny valid set (up to 5\% size of the training set) to compute DS weight, our approach can notably promote the reasoning ability of current LLM self-improvement methods. The resulting performance is on par with methods that rely on external supervision from pre-trained reward models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Han, Zijian Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Guojiang Shen, Xiangjie Kong, Xuetao Wei, Liqiang Nie, Jieping Ye, Yuanshao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: As urban residents demand higher travel quality, vehicle dispatch has become a critical component of online ride-hailing services. However, current vehicle dispatch systems struggle to navigate the complexities of urban traffic dynamics, including unpredictable traffic conditions, diverse driver behaviors, and fluctuating supply and demand patterns. These challenges have resulted in travel difficulties for passengers in certain areas, while many drivers in other areas are unable to secure orders, leading to a decline in the overall quality of urban transportation services. To address these issues, this paper introduces GARLIC: a framework of GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for vehicle dispatching. GARLIC utilizes multiview graphs to capture hierarchical traffic states, and learns a dynamic reward function that accounts for individual driving behaviors. The framework further integrates a GPT model trained with a custom loss function to enable high-precision predictions and optimize dispatching policies in real-world scenarios. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GARLIC effectively aligns with driver behaviors while reducing the empty load rate of vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neelabh Sinha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become key to user experience, particularly after improved generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages. Our framework can also be extended to other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dasol Choi, Dongbin Na</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosive growth of deep learning applications and increasing privacy concerns, the right to be forgotten has become a critical requirement in various AI industries. For example, given a facial recognition system, some individuals may wish to remove their personal data that might have been used in the training phase. Unfortunately, deep neural networks sometimes unexpectedly leak personal identities, making this removal challenging. While recent machine unlearning algorithms aim to enable models to forget specific data, we identify an unintended utility drop-correlation collapse-in which the essential correlations between image features and true labels weaken during the forgetting process. To address this challenge, we propose Distribution-Level Feature Distancing (DLFD), a novel method that efficiently forgets instances while preserving task-relevant feature correlations. Our method synthesizes data samples by optimizing the feature distribution to be distinctly different from that of forget samples, achieving effective results within a single training epoch. Through extensive experiments on facial recognition datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods in both forgetting performance and model utility preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxi Zhang, Jiuding Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into LLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for fine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Wendi Yu, Yao Yao, Wei Tong, Yingbin Liang, Qihang Lin, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the real world, a learning-enabled system usually undergoes multiple cycles of model development to enhance the system's ability to handle difficult or emerging tasks. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as failure to strictly preserve the good performance of the old model not only introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we present a retention-centric framework by formulating the model developmental safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to develop a pretrained vision-language model, specifically the CLIP model, for acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richt\'arik</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Subramanian, James Damewood, Juno Nam, Kevin P. Greenman, Avni P. Singhal, Rafael G\'omez-Bombarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Organic optoelectronic materials are a promising avenue for next-generation electronic devices due to their solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) sensitive molecules have unique applications in night-vision equipment and biomedical imaging. Molecular engineering has played a crucial role in developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as the Y-series molecules, which have significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and enhanced spectral coverage in the NIR region. However, systematically designing molecules with targeted optoelectronic properties while ensuring synthetic accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, we leverage structural priors from domain-focused, patent-mined datasets of organic electronic molecules using a symmetry-aware fragment decomposition algorithm and a fragment-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generator. Our approach generates candidates that retain symmetry constraints from the patent dataset, while also exhibiting red-shifted absorption, as validated by TD-DFT calculations.</p>

By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubha Goel, Puneet Pasricha, Juho Kanniainen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luran Wang, Chaoran Cheng, Yizhen Liao, Yanru Qu, Ge Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlled generation with pre-trained Diffusion and Flow Matching models has vast applications. One strategy for guiding ODE-based generative models is through optimizing a target loss $R(x_1)$ while staying close to the prior distribution. Along this line, some recent work showed the effectiveness of guiding flow model by differentiating through its ODE sampling process. Despite the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover, existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3), which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3). We show that existing backprop-through-ODE methods can be interpreted as special cases of Euclidean OC-Flow. OC-Flow achieved superior performance in extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule generation, and all-atom peptide design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imad Ali Shah, Jiarong Li, Martin Glavin, Edward Jones, Enda Ward, Brian Deegan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is known for its advantages over traditional RGB imaging in remote sensing, agriculture, and medicine. Recently, it has gained attention for enhancing Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) perception. Several HSI datasets such as HyKo, HSI-Drive, HSI-Road, and Hyperspectral City have been made available. However, a comprehensive evaluation of semantic segmentation models (SSM) using these datasets is lacking. To address this gap, we evaluated the available annotated HSI datasets on four deep learning-based baseline SSMs: DeepLab v3+, HRNet, PSPNet, and U-Net, along with its two variants: Coordinate Attention (UNet-CA) and Convolutional Block-Attention Module (UNet-CBAM). The original model architectures were adapted to handle the varying spatial and spectral dimensions of the datasets. These baseline SSMs were trained using a class-weighted loss function for individual HSI datasets and evaluated using mean-based metrics such as intersection over union (IoU), recall, precision, F1 score, specificity, and accuracy. Our results indicate that UNet-CBAM, which extracts channel-wise features, outperforms other SSMs and shows potential to leverage spectral information for enhanced semantic segmentation. This study establishes a baseline SSM benchmark on available annotated datasets for future evaluation of HSI-based ADAS perception. However, limitations of current HSI datasets, such as limited dataset size, high class imbalance, and lack of fine-grained annotations, remain significant constraints for developing robust SSMs for ADAS applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viacheslav Surkov, Chris Wendler, Mikhail Terekhov, Justin Deschenaux, Robert West, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a core ingredient in the reverse engineering of large-language models (LLMs). For LLMs, they have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigated the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for a few-step text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL Turbo. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net. We find that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. In particular, we find one block that deals mainly with image composition, one that is mainly responsible for adding local details, and one for color, illumination, and style. Therefore, our work is an important first step towards better understanding the internals of generative text-to-image models like SDXL Turbo and showcases the potential of features learned by SAEs for the visual domain.

<p>Abstract: Current RLHF frameworks for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically assume a fixed prompt distribution, which is sub-optimal and limits the scalability of alignment and generalizability of models. To address this, we introduce a general open-ended RLHF framework that casts alignment as an asymmetric game between two players: (i) a creator that generates increasingly informative prompt distributions using reward signals, and (ii) a solver that learns to produce more preferred responses on prompts produced by the creator. This framework of Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva), results in a simple and efficient approach that can utilize any existing RLHF algorithm for scalable alignment. eva outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely-used benchmarks, without the need of any additional human crafted prompts. Specifically, eva improves the win rate of Gemma-2-9B-it on Arena-Hard from 51.6% to 60.1% with DPO, from 55.7% to 58.9% with SPPO, from 52.3% to 60.7% with SimPO, and from 54.8% to 60.3% with ORPO, surpassing its 27B version and matching claude-3-opus. This improvement is persistent even when new human crafted prompts are introduced. Finally, we show eva is effective and robust under various ablation settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mischa Dombrowski, Hadrien Reynaud, Bernhard Kainz</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models can easily deceive casual observers and domain experts alike thanks to the produced image quality and temporal consistency. Beyond entertainment, this creates opportunities around safe data sharing of fully synthetic datasets, which are crucial in healthcare, as well as other domains relying on sensitive personal information. However, privacy concerns with this approach have not fully been addressed yet, and models trained on synthetic data for specific downstream tasks still perform worse than those trained on real data. This discrepancy may be partly due to the sampling space being a subspace of the training videos, effectively reducing the training data size for downstream models. Additionally, the reduced temporal consistency when generating long videos could be a contributing factor.
  In this paper, we first show that training privacy-preserving models in latent space is computationally more efficient and generalize better. Furthermore, to investigate downstream degradation factors, we propose to use a re-identification model, previously employed as a privacy preservation filter. We demonstrate that it is sufficient to train this model on the latent space of the video generator. Subsequently, we use these models to evaluate the subspace covered by synthetic video datasets and thus introduce a new way to measure the faithfulness of generative machine learning models. We focus on a specific application in healthcare echocardiography to illustrate the effectiveness of our novel methods. Our findings indicate that only up to 30.8% of the training videos are learned in latent video diffusion models, which could explain the lack of performance when training downstream tasks on synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantization stands as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) serving, yet it poses significant challenges particularly in achieving effective low-bit quantization. The limited numerical mapping makes the quantized model produce a non-trivial error, bringing out intolerable performance degration. This paper is anchored in the basic idea of model compression objectives, and delves into the layer-wise error distribution of LLMs during post-training quantization. Subsequently, we introduce ASER, an algorithm consisting of (1) Error Reconstruction: low-rank compensation for quantization error with LoRA-style matrices constructed by whitening SVD; (2) Activation Smoothing: outlier extraction to gain smooth activation and better error compensation. ASER is capable of quantizing typical LLMs to low-bit ones, particularly preserving accuracy even in W4A8 per-channel setup. Experimental results show that ASER is competitive among the state-of-the-art quantization algorithms, showing potential to activation quantization, with minor overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhu, Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.</p>

<p>Abstract: The year 2022 marks a watershed in technology, and arguably in human history, with the release of powerful generative AIs capable of convincingly performing creative tasks. With the help of these systems, anyone can create something that would previously have been considered a remarkable work of art. In human-AI collaboration, the computer seems to have become more than a tool. Many who have made their first contact with current generative AIs see them as "creativity machines" while for others the term "machine creativity" remains an oxymoron. This article is about (the possibility of) creativity in computers within the current Machine Learning paradigm. It outlines some of the key concepts behind the technologies and the innovations that have contributed to this qualitative shift, with a focus on text-to-image systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongliu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness. This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Nguyen, Gautam Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mithun Parab, Pranay Lendave, Jiyoung Kim, Thi Quynh Dan Nguyen, Palash Ingle</p>
<p>Abstract: In image-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), understanding surgical scenes is vital for real-time feedback to surgeons, skill evaluation, and improving outcomes through collaborative human-robot procedures. Within this context, the challenge lies in accurately detecting, segmenting, and estimating the depth of surgical scenes depicted in high-resolution images, while simultaneously reconstructing the scene in 3D and providing segmentation of surgical instruments along with detection labels for each instrument. To address this challenge, a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network is proposed for performing these tasks concurrently. A key aspect of this approach involves overcoming the optimization hurdles associated with handling multiple tasks concurrently by integrating a Adversarial Weight Update into the MTL framework, the proposed MTL model achieves 3D reconstruction through the integration of segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, thereby enhancing the understanding of surgical scenes, which marks a significant advancement compared to existing studies that lack 3D capabilities. Comprehensive experiments on the EndoVis2018 benchmark dataset underscore the adeptness of the model in efficiently addressing all three tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Mehta, Shivam Chauhan, Monojit Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Khalifa, Yi-Chern Tan, Arash Ahmadian, Tom Hosking, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Ahmet \"Ust\"un, Tom Sherborne, Matthias Gall\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has shown great promise at combining expert models, but the benefit of merging is unclear when merging ``generalist'' models trained on many tasks. We explore merging in the context of large (~100B) models, by recycling checkpoints that exhibit tradeoffs among different tasks. Such checkpoints are often created in the process of developing a frontier model, and many suboptimal ones are usually discarded. Given a pool of model checkpoints obtained from different training runs (e.g., different stages, objectives, hyperparameters, and data mixtures), which naturally show tradeoffs across different language capabilities (e.g., instruction following vs. code generation), we investigate whether merging can recycle such suboptimal models into a Pareto-optimal one. Our optimization algorithm tunes the weight of each checkpoint in a linear combination, resulting in a Pareto-optimal models that outperforms both individual models and merge-based baselines. Further analysis shows that good merges tend to include almost all checkpoints with non-zero weights, indicating that even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04924">Follow the money: a startup-based measure of AI exposure across occupations, industries and regions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Maria Fenoaltea, Dario Mazzilli, Aurelio Patelli, Angelica Sbardella, Andrea Tacchella, Andrea Zaccaria, Marco Trombetti, Luciano Pietronero</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace is advancing rapidly, necessitating robust metrics to evaluate its tangible impact on the labour market. Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely focus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on the basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual adoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers. To address this gap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index-a novel metric based on occupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups funded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while high-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to conventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles involving routine organizational tasks-such as data analysis and office management-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that are less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than feasibility, considerations -- such as judges or surgeons -- present lower AISE scores. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a nuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the conventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks, highlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal desirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI exposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings suggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much as by the technical feasibility of AI applications. This framework provides a dynamic, forward-looking tool for policymakers and stakeholders to monitor AI's evolving impact and navigate the changing labour landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology has transformed modern archaeology by unveiling hidden landscapes beneath dense vegetation. However, the lack of expert-annotated, open-access resources has hindered the analysis of ALS data using advanced deep learning techniques. We address this limitation with Archaeoscape (available at https://archaeoscape.ai/data/2024/), a novel large-scale archaeological ALS dataset spanning 888 km$^2$ in Cambodia with 31,141 annotated archaeological features from the Angkorian period. Archaeoscape is over four times larger than comparable datasets, and the first ALS archaeology resource with open-access data, annotations, and models.
  We benchmark several recent segmentation models to demonstrate the benefits of modern vision techniques for this problem and highlight the unique challenges of discovering subtle human-made structures under dense jungle canopies. By making Archaeoscape available in open access, we hope to bridge the gap between traditional archaeology and modern computer vision methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biju Issac, Kyle Fryer, Seibu Mary Jacob</p>
<p>Abstract: Botnets could autonomously infect, propagate, communicate and coordinate with other members in the botnet, enabling cybercriminals to exploit the cumulative computing and bandwidth of its bots to facilitate cybercrime. Traditional detection methods are becoming increasingly unsuitable against various network-based detection evasion methods. These techniques ultimately render signature-based fingerprinting detection infeasible and thus this research explores the application of network flow-based behavioural modelling to facilitate the binary classification of bot network activity, whereby the detection is independent of underlying communications architectures, ports, protocols and payload-based detection evasion mechanisms. A comparative evaluation of various machine learning classification methods is conducted, to precisely determine the average accuracy of each classifier on bot datasets like CTU-13, ISOT 2010 and ISCX 2014. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using Genetic Algorithm (GA), aiming to efficiently converge to the fittest hyperparameter set for each dataset was done. The bioinspired optimisation of Random Forest (RF) with GA achieved an average accuracy of 99.85% when it was tested against the three datasets. The model was then developed into a software product.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhen Bian, Yubo Zhou, Kaitai Zhang, Xiaohan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have significantly improved the quality of generated speech, closely matching the timbre and intonation of the target speaker. However, due to the inherent complexity of human emotional expression, the development of TTS systems capable of controlling subtle emotional differences remains a formidable challenge. Existing emotional speech databases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to capture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of emotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have focussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to describe speech emotions. However, these approaches are costly and require more emotional depth to train robust systems. In this paper, we propose a novel process aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich speech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions through a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of the database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual annotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language models. The resulting rich database provides a scalable and economically viable solution for developing a more nuanced and dynamic basis for developing emotionally controlled TTS systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Zhou, Weizhen Bian, Kaitai Zhang, Xiaohan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional medical practices, music therapy has proven effective in treating various psychological and physiological ailments. Particularly in Eastern traditions, the Five Elements Music Therapy (FEMT), rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, possesses profound cultural significance and unique therapeutic philosophies. With the rapid advancement of Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence, applying these modern technologies to FEMT could enhance the personalization and cultural relevance of the therapy and potentially improve therapeutic outcomes. In this article, we developed a music therapy system for the first time by applying the theory of the five elements in music therapy to practice. This innovative approach integrates advanced Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence with Five-Element Music Therapy (FEMT) to enhance personalized music therapy practices. As traditional music therapy predominantly follows Western methodologies, the unique aspects of Eastern practices, specifically the Five-Element theory from traditional Chinese medicine, should be considered. This system aims to bridge this gap by utilizing computational technologies to provide a more personalized, culturally relevant, and therapeutically effective music therapy experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source," which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification level of "open science" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and performs competitively in few-shot evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Morales-Navarro, Yasmin B. Kafai, Lauren Vogelstein, Evelyn Yu, Dana\"e Metaxa</p>
<p>Abstract: While there is widespread interest in supporting young people to critically evaluate machine learning-powered systems, there is little research on how we can support them in inquiring about how these systems work and what their limitations and implications may be. Outside of K-12 education, an effective strategy in evaluating black-boxed systems is algorithm auditing-a method for understanding algorithmic systems' opaque inner workings and external impacts from the outside in. In this paper, we review how expert researchers conduct algorithm audits and how end users engage in auditing practices to propose five steps that, when incorporated into learning activities, can support young people in auditing algorithms. We present a case study of a team of teenagers engaging with each step during an out-of-school workshop in which they audited peer-designed generative AI TikTok filters. We discuss the kind of scaffolds we provided to support youth in algorithm auditing and directions and challenges for integrating algorithm auditing into classroom activities. This paper contributes: (a) a conceptualization of five steps to scaffold algorithm auditing learning activities, and (b) examples of how youth engaged with each step during our pilot study.</p>

However, the categorical nature of administrative data recorded for homeless individuals hinders the development of accurate machine learning methods for this task. This work asserts that deriving latent representations of such features, while at the same time leveraging underlying relationships between instances is crucial in algorithmically enhancing the existing assignment decision-making process. Our proposed approach learns temporal and functional relationships between services from historical data, as well as unobserved but relevant relationships between individuals to generate features that significantly improve the prediction of the next service assignment compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent gain in popularity of AI conversational agents has led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through lived experience of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 individuals with lived mental health experience and workshops involving lived experience experts to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchang Sun, Xinran Li, Tao Lin, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning among decentralized clients while safeguarding the privacy of their local data. Existing studies on FL typically assume offline labeled data available at each client when the training starts. Nevertheless, the training data in practice often arrive at clients in a streaming fashion without ground-truth labels. Given the expensive annotation cost, it is critical to identify a subset of informative samples for labeling on clients. However, selecting samples locally while accommodating the global training objective presents a challenge unique to FL. In this work, we tackle this conundrum by framing the data querying process in FL as a collaborative decentralized decision-making problem and proposing an effective solution named LeaDQ, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, under the implicit guidance from global information, LeaDQ effectively learns the local policies for distributed clients and steers them towards selecting samples that can enhance the global model's accuracy. Extensive simulations on image and text tasks show that LeaDQ advances the model performance in various FL scenarios, outperforming the benchmarking algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Rafi Hasan, Niloy Kumar Kundu, Saad Hasan, Mohammad Rashedul Hoque, Swakkhar Shatabda</p>
<p>Abstract: The Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method is a rice-growing water management technique promoted as a sustainable alternative to Continuous Flooding (CF). Climate change has placed the agricultural sector in a challenging position, particularly as global water resources become increasingly scarce, affecting rice production on irrigated lowlands. Rice, a staple food for over half of the world's population, demands significantly more water than other major crops. In Bangladesh, Boro rice, in particular, requires considerable water inputs during its cultivation. Traditionally, farmers manually measure water levels, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. While ultrasonic sensors offer improvements in water height measurement, they still face limitations, such as susceptibility to weather conditions and environmental factors. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that automates water height measurement using computer vision, specifically through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention-based architecture achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.9885 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.2766, providing a more accurate and efficient solution for managing AWD systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consider the scenario where multiple agents have to move in an optimal way through a network, each one towards their ending position while avoiding collisions. By optimal, we mean as fast as possible, which is evaluated by a measure known as the makespan of the proposed solution. This is the setting studied in the Multiagent Path Finding problem. In this work, we additionally provide the agents with a way to communicate with each other. Due to size constraints, it is reasonable to assume that the range of communication of each agent will be limited. What should be the trajectories of the agents to, additionally, maintain a backbone of communication? In this work, we study the Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraint problem under the parameterized complexity framework.
  Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when considering particular structures for the input network. We provide such algorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents (the makespan resp.) are provided in the input and the network has a tree topology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded treewidth resp.). We complement these results by showing that it is highly unlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of agents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication range is $1$.</p>
