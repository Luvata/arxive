<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewook Kim, Ze Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Jiang Wang, Lijuan Wang, Zicheng Liu, Qiang Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated tremendous success in synthesizing visually stunning images given textual instructions. Despite remarkable progress in creating high-fidelity visuals, text-to-image models can still struggle with precisely rendering subjects, such as text spelling. To address this challenge, this paper explores using additional conditions of an image that provides visual guidance of the particular subjects for diffusion models to generate. In addition, this reference condition empowers the model to be conditioned in ways that the vocabularies of the text tokenizer cannot adequately represent, and further extends the model's generalization to novel capabilities such as generating non-English text spellings. We develop several small-scale expert plugins that efficiently endow a Stable Diffusion model with the capability to take different references. Each plugin is trained with auxiliary networks and loss functions customized for applications such as English scene-text generation, multi-lingual scene-text generation, and logo-image generation. Our expert plugins demonstrate superior results than the existing methods on all tasks, each containing only 28.55M trainable parameters.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16714">TPIE: Topology-Preserved Image Editing With Text Instructions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nivetha Jayakumar, Srivardhan Reddy Gadila, Tonmoy Hossain, Yangfeng Ji, Miaomiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preserving topological structures is important in real-world applications, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare and medicine, where the correctness of human anatomy is critical. However, most existing image editing models focus on manipulating intensity and texture features, often overlooking object geometry within images. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel method, Topology-Preserved Image Editing with text instructions (TPIE), that for the first time ensures the topology and geometry remaining intact in edited images through text-guided generative diffusion models. More specifically, our method treats newly generated samples as deformable variations of a given input template, allowing for controllable and structure-preserving edits. Our proposed TPIE framework consists of two key modules: (i) an autoencoder-based registration network that learns latent representations of object transformations, parameterized by velocity fields, from pairwise training images; and (ii) a novel latent conditional geometric diffusion (LCDG) model efficiently capturing the data distribution of learned transformation features conditioned on custom-defined text instructions. We validate TPIE on a diverse set of 2D and 3D images and compare them with state-of-the-art image editing approaches. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in generating more realistic images with well-preserved topology. Our code will be made publicly available on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely popular and effective for image classification tasks but tend to be overly confident in their predictions. Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. P. Sharan, Minkyu Choi, Sahil Shah, Harsh Goel, Mohammad Omama, Sandeep Chinchali</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video models such as Sora, Gen-3, MovieGen, and CogVideoX are pushing the boundaries of synthetic video generation, with adoption seen in fields like robotics, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16719">Learn2Synth: Learning Optimal Data Synthesis Using Hypergradients</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Hu, Oula Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, Bruce Fischl, Yael Balbastre</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain randomization through synthesis is a powerful strategy to train networks that are unbiased with respect to the domain of the input images. Randomization allows networks to see a virtually infinite range of intensities and artifacts during training, thereby minimizing overfitting to appearance and maximizing generalization to unseen data. While powerful, this approach relies on the accurate tuning of a large set of hyper-parameters governing the probabilistic distribution of the synthesized images. Instead of manually tuning these parameters, we introduce Learn2Synth, a novel procedure in which synthesis parameters are learned using a small set of real labeled data. Unlike methods that impose constraints to align synthetic data with real data (e.g., contrastive or adversarial techniques), which risk misaligning the image and its label map, we tune an augmentation engine such that a segmentation network trained on synthetic data has optimal accuracy when applied to real data. This approach allows the training procedure to benefit from real labeled examples, without ever using these real examples to train the segmentation network, which avoids biasing the network towards the properties of the training set. Specifically, we develop both parametric and nonparametric strategies to augment the synthetic images, enhancing the segmentation network's performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning strategy. Code is available at: https://github.com/HuXiaoling/Learn2Synth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wu, Jingyi Xu, Hieu Le, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at high-quality image and video generation. However, a major drawback is their high latency. A simple yet powerful way to speed them up is by merging similar tokens for faster computation, though this can result in some quality loss. In this paper, we demonstrate that preserving important tokens during merging significantly improves sample quality. Notably, the importance of each token can be reliably determined using the classifier-free guidance magnitude, as this measure is strongly correlated with the conditioning input and corresponds to output fidelity. Since classifier-free guidance incurs no additional computational cost or requires extra modules, our method can be easily integrated into most diffusion-based frameworks. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline across various applications, including text-to-image synthesis, multi-view image generation, and video generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16721">Steering Away from Harm: An Adaptive Approach to Defending Vision Language Model Against Jailbreaks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against both unseen attacks at design time (i.e., structured-based attacks) and adversarial images from diverse distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoyoung Kim, Seokhee Jin, Changhwan Sung, Jaechang Kim, Jungseul Ok</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance across various classification tasks. Nonetheless, their reliance on hand-crafted text prompts for each task hinders efficient adaptation to new tasks. While prompt learning offers a promising solution, most studies focus on maximizing the utilization of given few-shot labeled datasets, often overlooking the potential of careful data selection strategies, which enable higher accuracy with fewer labeled data. This motivates us to study a budget-efficient active prompt learning framework. Specifically, we introduce a class-guided clustering that leverages the pre-trained image and text encoders of VLMs, thereby enabling our cluster-balanced acquisition function from the initial round of active learning. Furthermore, considering the substantial class-wise variance in confidence exhibited by VLMs, we propose a budget-saving selective querying based on adaptive class-wise thresholds. Extensive experiments in active learning scenarios across nine datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangqi Jiang, Junkai Chen, Beier Zhu, Tingjin Luo, Yankun Shen, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly undermine their reliability, motivating researchers to explore the causes of hallucination. However, most studies primarily focus on the language aspect rather than the visual. In this paper, we address how LVLMs process visual information and whether this process causes hallucination. Firstly, we use the attention lens to identify the stages at which LVLMs handle visual data, discovering that the middle layers are crucial. Moreover, we find that these layers can be further divided into two stages: "visual information enrichment" and "semantic refinement" which respectively propagate visual data to object tokens and interpret it through text. By analyzing attention patterns during the visual information enrichment stage, we find that real tokens consistently receive higher attention weights than hallucinated ones, serving as a strong indicator of hallucination. Further examination of multi-head attention maps reveals that hallucination tokens often result from heads interacting with inconsistent objects. Based on these insights, we propose a simple inference-time method that adjusts visual attention by integrating information across various heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates hallucinations in mainstream LVLMs without additional training costs.</p>

We uncover monosemantic interpretable features by leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAE). We substantiate our mechanistic interpretations via transfer learning using light-weight classifiers on off-the-shelf diffusion models' features. On $4$ datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion features for representation learning. We provide in-depth analysis of how different diffusion architectures, pre-training datasets, and language model conditioning impacts visual representation granularity, inductive biases, and transfer learning capabilities. Our work is a critical step towards deepening interpretability of black-box diffusion models. Code and visualizations available at: https://github.com/revelio-diffusion/revelio</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Yueyan Li, Zilu Guo, Jun Du, Shutong Niu, Jiefeng Ma, Shan He, Xiaoyan Wu, Qiming Hu, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Qingfeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of talking head generation, yet still face challenges in expressiveness, controllability, and stability in long-time generation. In this research, we propose an EmotiveTalk framework to address these issues. Firstly, to realize better control over the generation of lip movement and facial expression, a Vision-guided Audio Information Decoupling (V-AID) approach is designed to generate audio-based decoupled representations aligned with lip movements and expression. Specifically, to achieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we present a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within V-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion condition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head Diffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking head videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to automatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while integrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive generation performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate expressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of emotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingwen Zhang, Meng Wang, Xihua Sheng, Peilin Chen, Junru Li, Li Zhang, Shiqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lossy image compression networks aim to minimize the latent entropy of images while adhering to specific distortion constraints. However, optimizing the neural network can be challenging due to its nature of learning quantized latent representations. In this paper, our key finding is that minimizing the latent entropy is, to some extent, equivalent to maximizing the conditional source entropy, an insight that is deeply rooted in information-theoretic equalities. Building on this insight, we propose a novel structural regularization method for the neural image compression task by incorporating the negative conditional source entropy into the training objective, such that both the optimization efficacy and the model's generalization ability can be promoted. The proposed information-theoretic regularizer is interpretable, plug-and-play, and imposes no inference overheads. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in regularizing the models and further squeezing bits from the latent representation across various compression structures and unseen domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, road graph extraction has garnered increasing attention due to its crucial role in autonomous driving, navigation, etc. However, accurately and efficiently extracting road graphs remains a persistent challenge, primarily due to the severe scarcity of labeled data. To address this limitation, we collect a global-scale satellite road graph extraction dataset, i.e. Global-Scale dataset. Specifically, the Global-Scale dataset is $\sim20 \times$ larger than the largest existing public road extraction dataset and spans over 13,800 $km^2$ globally. Additionally, we develop a novel road graph extraction model, i.e. SAM-Road++, which adopts a node-guided resampling method to alleviate the mismatch issue between training and inference in SAM-Road, a pioneering state-of-the-art road graph extraction model. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective ``extended-line'' strategy in SAM-Road++ to mitigate the occlusion issue on the road. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity of the collected Global-Scale dataset and the proposed SAM-Road++ method, particularly highlighting its superior predictive power in unseen regions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubhav Jain, Yuya Kobayashi, Takashi Shibuya, Yuhta Takida, Nasir Memon, Julian Togelius, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are prone to exactly reproduce images from the training data. This exact reproduction of the training data is concerning as it can lead to copyright infringement and/or leakage of privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel way to understand the memorization phenomenon, and propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate it. We argue that memorization occurs because of an attraction basin in the denoising process which steers the diffusion trajectory towards a memorized image. However, this can be mitigated by guiding the diffusion trajectory away from the attraction basin by not applying classifier-free guidance until an ideal transition point occurs from which classifier-free guidance is applied. This leads to the generation of non-memorized images that are high in image quality and well-aligned with the conditioning mechanism. To further improve on this, we present a new guidance technique, \emph{opposite guidance}, that escapes the attraction basin sooner in the denoising process. We demonstrate the existence of attraction basins in various scenarios in which memorization occurs, and we show that our proposed approach successfully mitigates memorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jilong Guo, Haobo Yang, Mo Zhou, Xinyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Removing adverse weather conditions such as rain, raindrop, and snow from images is critical for various real-world applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing. However, existing multi-task approaches typically rely on augmenting the model with additional parameters to handle multiple scenarios. While this enables the model to address diverse tasks, the introduction of extra parameters significantly complicates its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration under adverse weather, designed to effectively handle image degradation under diverse weather conditions without additional parameters. Our method segments model parameters into common and specific components by evaluating the gradient variation intensity during training for each specific weather condition. This enables the model to precisely and adaptively learn relevant features for each weather scenario, improving both efficiency and effectiveness without compromising on performance. This method constructs specific masks based on gradient fluctuations to isolate parameters influenced by other tasks, ensuring that the model achieves strong performance across all scenarios without adding extra parameters. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets. Specifically, our method achieves PSNR scores of 29.22 on the Raindrop dataset, 30.76 on the Rain dataset, and 29.56 on the Snow100K dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Chen, Dannong Xu, Junjie Fei, Chun-Mei Feng, Mohamed Elhoseiny</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet they face limitations in real-world applications requiring complex reasoning over a large number of images. Existing benchmarks for multi-image question-answering are limited in scope, each question is paired with only up to 30 images, which does not fully capture the demands of large-scale retrieval tasks encountered in the real-world usages. To reduce these gaps, we introduce two document haystack benchmarks, dubbed DocHaystack and InfoHaystack, designed to evaluate LMM performance on large-scale visual document retrieval and understanding. Additionally, we propose V-RAG, a novel, vision-centric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a suite of multimodal vision encoders, each optimized for specific strengths, and a dedicated question-document relevance module. V-RAG sets a new standard, with a 9% and 11% improvement in Recall@1 on the challenging DocHaystack-1000 and InfoHaystack-1000 benchmarks, respectively, compared to the previous best baseline models. Additionally, integrating V-RAG with LMMs enables them to efficiently operate across thousands of images, yielding significant improvements on our DocHaystack and InfoHaystack benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei You, Rui Gan, Weizhe Tang, Zilin Huang, Jiaxi Liu, Zhuoyu Jiang, Haotian Shi, Keshu Wu, Keke Long, Sicheng Fu, Sikai Chen, Bin Ran</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojie Zhang, Zhihao Liang, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Xuefei Liu, Chenxing Li, Jianhua Tao, Yaling Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Portrait image animation using audio has rapidly advanced, enabling the creation of increasingly realistic and expressive animated faces. The challenges of this multimodality-guided video generation task involve fusing various modalities while ensuring consistency in timing and portrait. We further seek to produce vivid talking heads. To address these challenges, we present LetsTalk (LatEnt Diffusion TranSformer for Talking Video Synthesis), a diffusion transformer that incorporates modular temporal and spatial attention mechanisms to merge multimodality and enhance spatial-temporal consistency. To handle multimodal conditions, we first summarize three fusion schemes, ranging from shallow to deep fusion compactness, and thoroughly explore their impact and applicability. Then we propose a suitable solution according to the modality differences of image, audio, and video generation. For portrait, we utilize a deep fusion scheme (Symbiotic Fusion) to ensure portrait consistency. For audio, we implement a shallow fusion scheme (Direct Fusion) to achieve audio-animation alignment while preserving diversity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates temporally coherent and realistic videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Li, Fan Ma, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been employed to generate high-quality images, reducing the need for manual data collection and improving model generalization in tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and image perception. However, the synthetic framework is usually designed with meticulous human effort for each task due to various requirements on image layout, content, and annotation formats, restricting the application of synthetic data on more general scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnySynth, a unified framework integrating adaptable, comprehensive, and highly controllable components capable of generating an arbitrary type of synthetic data given diverse requirements. Specifically, the Task-Specific Layout Generation Module is first introduced to produce reasonable layouts for different tasks by leveraging the generation ability of large language models and layout priors of real-world images. A Uni-Controlled Image Generation Module is then developed to create high-quality synthetic images that are controllable and based on the generated layouts. In addition, user specific reference images, and style images can be incorporated into the generation to task requirements. Finally, the Task-Oriented Annotation Module offers precise and detailed annotations for the generated images across different tasks. We have validated our framework's performance across various tasks, including Few-shot Object Detection, Cross-domain Object Detection, Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval, and Multi-modal Image Perception and Grounding. The specific data synthesized by our framework significantly improves model performance in these tasks, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Jingcheng Ni, Daniel Wang, Patrick Rim, Younjoon Chung, Fengyu Yang, Byung-Woo Hong, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential of leveraging language priors learned by text-to-image diffusion models to address ambiguity and visual nuisance in monocular depth estimation. Particularly, traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity due to the absence of stereo or multi-view depth cues, and nuisance due to lack of robustness of vision. We argue that language prior in diffusion models can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the geometric prior aligned with the language description, which is learned during text-to-image pre-training. To generate images that reflect the text properly, the model must comprehend the size and shape of specified objects, their spatial relationship, and the scale of the scene. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both image and text description that aligned with the scene to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language priors can guide the model's attention to specific regions and help it perceive the 3D scene in alignment with user intent. Simultaneously, it acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of the diffusion trajectory, since learning 3D properties from a condensed, low-dimensional language feature is more efficient compared with learning from a redundant, high-dimensional image feature. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and a faster convergence speed, compared with other diffusion-based depth estimators, across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16752">Imagine and Seek: Improving Composed Image Retrieval with an Imagined Proxy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> You Li, Fan Ma, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZSCIR) requires retrieving images that match the query image and the relative captions. Current methods focus on projecting the query image into the text feature space, subsequently combining them with features of query texts for retrieval. However, retrieving images only with the text features cannot guarantee detailed alignment due to the natural gap between images and text. In this paper, we introduce Imagined Proxy for CIR (IP-CIR), a training-free method that creates a proxy image aligned with the query image and text description, enhancing query representation in the retrieval process. We first leverage the large language model's generalization capability to generate an image layout, and then apply both the query text and image for conditional generation. The robust query features are enhanced by merging the proxy image, query image, and text semantic perturbation. Our newly proposed balancing metric integrates text-based and proxy retrieval similarities, allowing for more accurate retrieval of the target image while incorporating image-side information into the process. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval performances. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the CIRR dataset with a Recall@K of 70.07 at K=10. Additionally, we achieved an improvement in Recall@10 on the FashionIQ dataset, rising from 45.11 to 45.74, and improved the baseline performance in CIRCO with a mAPK@10 score, increasing from 32.24 to 34.26.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of AI techniques for image generation, coupled with their increasing accessibility, has raised significant concerns about the potential misuse of these images to spread misinformation. Recent AI-generated image detection (AGID) methods include CNNDetection, NPR, DM Image Detection, Fake Image Detection, DIRE, LASTED, GAN Image Detection, AIDE, SSP, DRCT, RINE, OCC-CLIP, De-Fake, and Deep Fake Detection. However, we argue that the current state-of-the-art AGID techniques are inadequate for effectively detecting contemporary AI-generated images and advocate for a comprehensive reevaluation of these methods. We introduce the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT^2), a benchmark comprising ~130K images generated by contemporary text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion 2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney 6). VCT^2 includes two sets of prompts sourced from tweets by the New York Times Twitter account and captions from the MS COCO dataset. We also evaluate the performance of the aforementioned AGID techniques on the VCT$^2$ benchmark, highlighting their ineffectiveness in detecting AI-generated images. As image-generative AI models continue to evolve, the need for a quantifiable framework to evaluate these models becomes increasingly critical. To meet this need, we propose the Visual AI Index (V_AI), which assesses generated images from various visual perspectives, including texture complexity and object coherence, setting a new standard for evaluating image-generative AI models. To foster research in this domain, we make our https://huggingface.co/datasets/anonymous1233/COCO_AI and https://huggingface.co/datasets/anonymous1233/twitter_AI datasets publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyao Niu, Yifan Zhan, Qingtian Zhu, Zhuoxiao Li, Wei Wang, Zhihang Zhong, Xiao Sun, Yinqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of 3D human avatars from multi-view videos represents a significant yet challenging task in the field. Recent advancements, including 3D Gaussian Splattings (3DGS), have markedly progressed this domain. Nonetheless, existing techniques necessitate the use of high-quality sharp images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world settings due to variations in human motion speed and intensity. In this study, we attempt to explore deriving sharp intrinsic 3D human Gaussian avatars from blurry video footage in an end-to-end manner. Our approach encompasses a 3D-aware, physics-oriented model of blur formation attributable to human movement, coupled with a 3D human motion model to clarify ambiguities found in motion-induced blurry images. This methodology facilitates the concurrent learning of avatar model parameters and the refinement of sub-frame motion parameters from a coarse initialization. We have established benchmarks for this task through a synthetic dataset derived from existing multi-view captures, alongside a real-captured dataset acquired through a 360-degree synchronous hybrid-exposure camera system. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our model surpasses existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faridoun Mehri (Sharif University of Technology), Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah (Sharif University of Technology), Mohammad Taher Pilehvar (Cardiff University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do gradient-based explanations struggle with Transformers, and how can we improve them? We identify gradient flow imbalances in Transformers that violate FullGrad-completeness, a critical property for attribution faithfulness that CNNs naturally possess. To address this issue, we introduce LibraGrad -- a theoretically grounded post-hoc approach that corrects gradient imbalances through pruning and scaling of backward paths, without changing the forward pass or adding computational overhead. We evaluate LibraGrad using three metric families: Faithfulness, which quantifies prediction changes under perturbations of the most and least relevant features; Completeness Error, which measures attribution conservation relative to model outputs; and Segmentation AP, which assesses alignment with human perception. Extensive experiments across 8 architectures, 4 model sizes, and 4 datasets show that LibraGrad universally enhances gradient-based methods, outperforming existing white-box methods -- including Transformer-specific approaches -- across all metrics. We demonstrate superior qualitative results through two complementary evaluations: precise text-prompted region highlighting on CLIP models and accurate class discrimination between co-occurring animals on ImageNet-finetuned models -- two settings on which existing methods often struggle. LibraGrad is effective even on the attention-free MLP-Mixer architecture, indicating potential for extension to other modern architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Hyeok Jung, Eun Tae Kim, Seo Yeon Kim, Joo Ho Lee, Bumsoo Kim, Buru Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) act as essential interfaces, connecting humans with AI technologies in multimodal applications. However, current MLLMs face challenges in accurately interpreting object orientation in images due to inconsistent orientation annotations in training data, hindering the development of a coherent orientation understanding. To overcome this, we propose egocentric instruction tuning, which aligns MLLMs' orientation understanding with the user's perspective, based on a consistent annotation standard derived from the user's egocentric viewpoint. We first generate egocentric instruction data that leverages MLLMs' ability to recognize object details and applies prior knowledge for orientation understanding. Using this data, we perform instruction tuning to enhance the model's capability for accurate orientation interpretation. In addition, we introduce EgoOrientBench, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' orientation understanding across three tasks using images collected from diverse domains. Experimental results on this benchmark show that egocentric instruction tuning significantly improves orientation understanding without compromising overall MLLM performance. The instruction data and benchmark dataset are available on our project page at https://github.com/jhCOR/EgoOrientBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjae Cho, Gwangyeol Kim, Sirojbek Safarov, Seongdeok Bang, Jaewoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: In anomaly detection, the scarcity of anomalous data compared to normal data poses a challenge in effectively utilizing deep neural network representations to identify anomalous features. From a data-centric perspective, generative models can solve this data imbalance issue by synthesizing anomaly datasets. Although previous research tried to enhance the controllability and quality of generating defects, they do not consider the relation between background and defect. Since the defect depends on the object's background (i.e., the normal part of an object), training only the defect area cannot utilize the background information, and even generation can be biased depending on the mask information. In addition, controlling logical anomalies should consider the dependency between background and defect areas (e.g., orange colored defect on a orange juice bottle). In this paper, our paper proposes modeling a relationship between the background and defect, where background affects denoising defects; however, the reverse is not. We introduce the regularizing term to disentangle denoising background from defects. From the disentanglement loss, we rethink defect generation with DDIM Inversion, where we generate the defect on the target normal image. Additionally, we theoretically prove that our methodology can generate a defect on the target normal image with an invariant background. We demonstrate our synthetic data is realistic and effective in several experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangze Xu, Yifan Zhan, Zhihang Zhong, Xiao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human avatars, through the use of canonical radiance fields and per-frame observed warping, enable high-fidelity rendering and animating. However, existing methods, which rely on either spatial SMPL(-X) poses or temporal embeddings, respectively suffer from coarse rendering quality or limited animation flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose GAST, a framework that unifies 3D human modeling with 3DGS by hierarchically integrating both spatial and temporal information. Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wey Yeh Choong, Yangyang Guo, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are widely acknowledged to be prone to hallucination. Existing research addressing this problem has primarily been confined to image inputs, with limited exploration of video-based hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods fail to capture nuanced errors in generated responses, which are often exacerbated by the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of videos. To address this, we introduce VidHal, a benchmark specially designed to evaluate video-based hallucinations in VLLMs. VidHal is constructed by bootstrapping video instances across common temporal aspects. A defining feature of our benchmark lies in the careful creation of captions which represent varying levels of hallucination associated with each video. To enable fine-grained evaluation, we propose a novel caption ordering task requiring VLLMs to rank captions by hallucinatory extent. We conduct extensive experiments on VidHal and comprehensively evaluate a broad selection of models. Our results uncover significant limitations in existing VLLMs regarding hallucination generation. Through our benchmark, we aim to inspire further research on 1) holistic understanding of VLLM capabilities, particularly regarding hallucination, and 2) extensive development of advanced VLLMs to alleviate this problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqi Zhang, He Sun, Hongmin Gao, Feng Han, Xu Sun, Lianru Gao, Bing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With consecutive bands in a wide range of wavelengths, hyperspectral images (HSI) have provided a unique tool for object detection task. However, existing HSI object detection methods have not been fully utilized in real applications, which is mainly resulted by the difference of spatial and spectral resolution between the unlabeled target domain and a labeled source domain, i.e. the domain shift of HSI. In this work, we aim to explore the unsupervised cross-domain object detection of HSI. Our key observation is that the local spatial-spectral characteristics remain invariant across different domains. For solving the problem of domain-shift, we propose a HSI cross-domain object detection method based on spectral-spatial feature alignment, which is the first attempt in the object detection community to the best of our knowledge. Firstly, we develop a spectral-spatial alignment module to extract domain-invariant local spatial-spectral features. Secondly, the spectral autocorrelation module has been designed to solve the domain shift in the spectral domain specifically, which can effectively align HSIs with different spectral resolutions. Besides, we have collected and annotated an HSI dataset for the cross-domain object detection. Our experimental results have proved the effectiveness of HSI cross-domain object detection, which has firstly demonstrated a significant and promising step towards HSI cross-domain object detection in the object detection community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feifei Shao, Ping Liu, Zhao Wang, Yawei Luo, Hongwei Wang, Jun Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud processing (PCP) encompasses tasks like reconstruction, denoising, registration, and segmentation, each often requiring specialized models to address unique task characteristics. While in-context learning (ICL) has shown promise across tasks by using a single model with task-specific demonstration prompts, its application to PCP reveals significant limitations. We identify inter-task and intra-task sensitivity issues in current ICL methods for PCP, which we attribute to inflexible sampling strategies lacking context adaptation at the point and prompt levels. To address these challenges, we propose MICAS, an advanced ICL framework featuring a multi-grained adaptive sampling mechanism tailored for PCP. MICAS introduces two core components: task-adaptive point sampling, which leverages inter-task cues for point-level sampling, and query-specific prompt sampling, which selects optimal prompts per query to mitigate intra-task sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce adaptive sampling tailored to the unique requirements of point clouds within an ICL framework. Extensive experiments show that MICAS not only efficiently handles various PCP tasks but also significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, it achieves a remarkable $4.1\%$ improvement in the part segmentation task and delivers consistent gains across various PCP applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in collecting large-scale datasets to improve segmentation and autonomous driving models. These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an essential technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to automatically respond to clinical inquiries about medical images. However, current medical VQA datasets exhibit two significant limitations: (1) they often lack visual and textual explanations for answers, which impedes their ability to satisfy the comprehension needs of patients and junior doctors; (2) they typically offer a narrow range of question formats, inadequately reflecting the diverse requirements encountered in clinical scenarios. These limitations pose significant challenges to the development of a reliable and user-friendly Med-VQA system. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale, Groundable, and Explainable Medical VQA benchmark for chest X-ray diagnosis (GEMeX), featuring several innovative components: (1) A multi-modal explainability mechanism that offers detailed visual and textual explanations for each question-answer pair, thereby enhancing answer comprehensibility; (2) Four distinct question types, open-ended, closed-ended, single-choice, and multiple-choice, that better reflect diverse clinical needs. We evaluated 10 representative large vision language models on GEMeX and found that they underperformed, highlighting the dataset's complexity. However, after fine-tuning a baseline model using the training set, we observed a significant performance improvement, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinpeng Liu, Jiale Xu, Weihao Cheng, Yiming Gao, Xintao Wang, Ying Shan, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NovelGS, a diffusion model for Gaussian Splatting (GS) given sparse-view images. Recent works leverage feed-forward networks to generate pixel-aligned Gaussians, which could be fast rendered. Unfortunately, the method was unable to produce satisfactory results for areas not covered by the input images due to the formulation of these methods. In contrast, we leverage the novel view denoising through a transformer-based network to generate 3D Gaussians. Specifically, by incorporating both conditional views and noisy target views, the network predicts pixel-aligned Gaussians for each view. During training, the rendered target and some additional views of the Gaussians are supervised. During inference, the target views are iteratively rendered and denoised from pure noise. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in addressing the multi-view image reconstruction challenge. Due to generative modeling of unseen regions, NovelGS effectively reconstructs 3D objects with consistent and sharp textures. Experimental results on publicly available datasets indicate that NovelGS substantially surpasses existing image-to-3D frameworks, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also demonstrate the potential of NovelGS in generative tasks, such as text-to-3D and image-to-3D, by integrating it with existing multiview diffusion models. We will make the code publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Li, Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose plays a crucial role in the digital age. While recent works have achieved impressive progress in understanding and generating human poses, they often support only a single modality of control signals and operate in isolation, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. This paper presents UniPose, a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit human poses across various modalities, including images, text, and 3D SMPL poses. Specifically, we apply a pose tokenizer to convert 3D poses into discrete pose tokens, enabling seamless integration into the LLM within a unified vocabulary. To further enhance the fine-grained pose perception capabilities, we facilitate UniPose with a mixture of visual encoders, among them a pose-specific visual encoder. Benefiting from a unified learning strategy, UniPose effectively transfers knowledge across different pose-relevant tasks, adapts to unseen tasks, and exhibits extended capabilities. This work serves as the first attempt at building a general-purpose framework for pose comprehension, generation, and editing. Extensive experiments highlight UniPose's competitive and even superior performance across various pose-relevant tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aravindan Sundaram, Ujjayan Pal, Abhimanyu Chauhan, Aishwarya Agarwal, Srikrishna Karanam</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image models, achieving semantically accurate images in text-to-image diffusion models is a persistent challenge. While existing initial latent optimization methods have demonstrated impressive performance, we identify two key limitations: (a) attention neglect, where the synthesized image omits certain subjects from the input prompt because they do not have a designated segment in the self-attention map despite despite having a high-response cross-attention, and (b) attention interference, where the generated image has mixed-up properties of multiple subjects because of a conflicting overlap between cross- and self-attention maps of different subjects.
  To address these limitations, we introduce CoCoNO, a new algorithm that optimizes the initial latent by leveraging the complementary information within self-attention and cross-attention maps. Our method introduces two new loss functions: the attention contrast loss, which minimizes undesirable overlap by ensuring each self-attention segment is exclusively linked to a specific subject's cross attention map, and the attention complete loss, which maximizes the activation within these segments to guarantee that each subject is fully and distinctly represented. Our approach operates within a noise optimization framework, avoiding the need to retrain base models. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that CoCoNO significantly improves text-image alignment and outperforms the current state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Yugay, Theo Gevers, Martin R. Oswald</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems with novel view synthesis capabilities are widely used in computer vision, with applications in augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. However, existing approaches are limited to single-agent operation. Recent work has addressed this problem using a distributed neural scene representation. Unfortunately, existing methods are slow, cannot accurately render real-world data, are restricted to two agents, and have limited tracking accuracy. In contrast, we propose a rigidly deformable 3D Gaussian-based scene representation that dramatically speeds up the system. However, improving tracking accuracy and reconstructing a globally consistent map from multiple agents remains challenging due to trajectory drift and discrepancies across agents' observations. Therefore, we propose new tracking and map-merging mechanisms and integrate loop closure in the Gaussian-based SLAM pipeline. We evaluate MAGiC-SLAM on synthetic and real-world datasets and find it more accurate and faster than the state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishwarya Agarwal, Srikrishna Karanam, Vineet Gandhi</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of single-source domain generalization. Existing methods typically rely on extensive augmentations to synthetically cover diverse domains during training. However, they struggle with semantic shifts (e.g., background and viewpoint changes), as they often learn global features instead of local concepts that tend to be domain invariant. To address this gap, we propose an approach that compels models to leverage such local concepts during prediction. Given no suitable dataset with per-class concepts and localization maps exists, we first develop a novel pipeline to generate annotations by exploiting the rich features of diffusion and large-language models. Our next innovation is TIDE, a novel training scheme with a concept saliency alignment loss that ensures model focus on the right per-concept regions and a local concept contrastive loss that promotes learning domain-invariant concept representations. This not only gives a robust model but also can be visually interpreted using the predicted concept saliency maps. Given these maps at test time, our final contribution is a new correction algorithm that uses the corresponding local concept representations to iteratively refine the prediction until it aligns with prototypical concept representations that we store at the end of model training. We evaluate our approach extensively on four standard DG benchmark datasets and substantially outperform the current state-ofthe-art (12% improvement on average) while also demonstrating that our predictions can be visually interpreted</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungeun Kim, Hyeongwoo Jeon, Jongseong Bae, Ha Young Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is a challenging task that involves translating sign language images into spoken language. For SLT models to perform this task successfully, they must bridge the modality gap and identify subtle variations in sign language components to understand their meanings accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gloss-free SLT framework called Multimodal Sign Language Translation (MMSLT), which leverages the representational capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we generate detailed textual descriptions of sign language components using MLLMs. Then, through our proposed multimodal-language pre-training module, we integrate these description features with sign video features to align them within the spoken sentence space. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily, highlighting the potential of MLLMs to be effectively utilized in SLT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohao Chen, Yanchao Zhang, Yanan Lv, Hua Han, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful technique in image generation, especially for image super-resolution tasks. While 2D diffusion models significantly enhance the resolution of individual images, existing diffusion-based methods for 3D volume super-resolution often struggle with structure discontinuities in axial direction and high sampling costs. In this work, we present a novel approach that leverages the 2D diffusion model and lateral continuity within the volume to enhance 3D volume electron microscopy (vEM) super-resolution. We first simulate lateral degradation with slices in the XY plane and train a 2D diffusion model to learn how to restore the degraded slices. The model is then applied slice-by-slice in the lateral direction of low-resolution volume, recovering slices while preserving inherent lateral continuity. Following this, a high-frequency-aware 3D super-resolution network is trained on the recovery lateral slice sequences to learn spatial feature transformation across slices. Finally, the network is applied to infer high-resolution volumes in the axial direction, enabling 3D super-resolution. We validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations, including image similarity assessments, resolution analysis, and performance on downstream tasks. Our results on two publicly available focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) datasets demonstrate the robustness and practical applicability of our framework for 3D volume super-resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Lin, Ling Luo, Ying Chen, Xushi Zhang, Zihui Wang, Wenxian Yang, Mengsha Tong, Rongshan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides high-resolution pathological images and whole-transcriptomic expression profiles at individual spots across whole-slide scales. This setting makes it an ideal data source to develop multimodal foundation models. Although recent studies attempted to fine-tune visual encoders with trainable gene encoders based on spot-level, the absence of a wider slide perspective and spatial intrinsic relationships limits their ability to capture ST-specific insights effectively. Here, we introduce ST-Align, the first foundation model designed for ST that deeply aligns image-gene pairs by incorporating spatial context, effectively bridging pathological imaging with genomic features. We design a novel pretraining framework with a three-target alignment strategy for ST-Align, enabling (1) multi-scale alignment across image-gene pairs, capturing both spot- and niche-level contexts for a comprehensive perspective, and (2) cross-level alignment of multimodal insights, connecting localized cellular characteristics and broader tissue architecture. Additionally, ST-Align employs specialized encoders tailored to distinct ST contexts, followed by an Attention-Based Fusion Network (ABFN) for enhanced multimodal fusion, effectively merging domain-shared knowledge with ST-specific insights from both pathological and genomic data. We pre-trained ST-Align on 1.3 million spot-niche pairs and evaluated its performance through two downstream tasks across six datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. ST-Align highlights the potential for reducing the cost of ST and providing valuable insights into the distinction of critical compositions within human tissue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhuvan Sachdeva, Naren Akash, Tajamul Ashraf, Simon Muller, Thomas Schultz, Maximilian W. M. Wintergerst, Niharika Singri Prasad, Kaushik Murali, Mohit Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure globally, with a disproportionately higher burden in developing countries. While automated surgical video analysis has been explored in general surgery, its application to ophthalmic procedures remains limited. Existing works primarily focus on Phaco cataract surgery, an expensive technique not accessible in regions where cataract treatment is most needed. In contrast, Manual Small-Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS) is the preferred low-cost, faster alternative in high-volume settings and for challenging cases. However, no dataset exists for MSICS. To address this gap, we introduce Cataract-MSICS, the first comprehensive dataset containing 53 surgical videos annotated for 18 surgical phases and 3,527 frames with 13 surgical tools at the pixel level. We benchmark this dataset on state-of-the-art models and present ToolSeg, a novel framework that enhances tool segmentation by introducing a phase-conditional decoder and a simple yet effective semi-supervised setup leveraging pseudo-labels from foundation models. Our approach significantly improves segmentation performance, achieving a $23.77\%$ to $38.10\%$ increase in mean Dice scores, with a notable boost for tools that are less prevalent and small. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ToolSeg generalizes to other surgical settings, showcasing its effectiveness on the CaDIS dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Xia, Quan Yuan, Guiyang Luo, Xiaoyuan Fu, Yang Li, Xuanhan Zhu, Tianyou Luo, Siheng Chen, Jinglin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative perception in autonomous driving significantly enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents. Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception, where agents have different and fixed perception networks, presents a major challenge due to the semantic gap in their exchanged intermediate features without modifying the perception networks. Most existing methods bridge the semantic gap through interpreters. However, they either require training a new interpreter for each new agent type, limiting extensibility, or rely on a two-stage interpretation via an intermediate standardized semantic space, causing cumulative semantic loss. To achieve both extensibility in immutable heterogeneous scenarios and low-loss feature interpretation, we propose PolyInter, a polymorphic feature interpreter. It contains an extension point through which emerging new agents can seamlessly integrate by overriding only their specific prompts, which are learnable parameters intended to guide the interpretation, while reusing PolyInter's remaining parameters. By leveraging polymorphism, our design ensures that a single interpreter is sufficient to accommodate diverse agents and interpret their features into the ego agent's semantic space. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate that PolyInter improves collaborative perception precision by up to 11.1% compared to SOTA interpreters, while comparable results can be achieved by training only 1.4% of PolyInter's parameters when adapting to new agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajing Lin, Zhenzhong Wang, Shu Jiang, Yongjie Hou, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of 4D content generation involves creating dynamic 3D models that evolve over time in response to specific input conditions, such as images. Existing methods rely heavily on pre-trained video diffusion models to guide 4D content dynamics, but these approaches often fail to capture essential physical principles, as video diffusion models lack a robust understanding of real-world physics. Moreover, these models face challenges in providing fine-grained control over dynamics and exhibit high computational costs. In this work, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel, high-efficiency framework that generates physics-compliant 4D content from a single image with enhanced control capabilities. Our approach uniquely integrates physical simulations into the 4D generation pipeline, ensuring adherence to fundamental physical laws. Inspired by the human ability to infer physical properties visually, we introduce a Physical Perception Module (PPM) that discerns the material properties and structural components of the 3D object from the input image, facilitating accurate downstream simulations. Phys4DGen significantly accelerates the 4D generation process by eliminating iterative optimization steps in the dynamics modeling phase. It allows users to intuitively control the movement speed and direction of generated 4D content by adjusting external forces, achieving finely tunable, physically plausible animations. Extensive evaluations show that Phys4DGen outperforms existing methods in both inference speed and physical realism, producing high-quality, controllable 4D content.

<p>Abstract: We present BootComp, a novel framework based on text-to-image diffusion models for controllable human image generation with multiple reference garments. Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Ligero, Tim Lenz, Georg W\"olflein, Omar S. M. El Nahhas, Daniel Truhn, Jakob Nikolas Kather</p>
<p>Abstract: To date, the most common approach for radiology deep learning pipelines is the use of end-to-end 3D networks based on models pre-trained on other tasks, followed by fine-tuning on the task at hand. In contrast, adjacent medical fields such as pathology, which focus on 2D images, have effectively adopted task-agnostic foundational models based on self-supervised learning (SSL), combined with weakly-supervised deep learning (DL). However, the field of radiology still lacks task-agnostic representation models due to the computational and data demands of 3D imaging and the anatomical complexity inherent to radiology scans. To address this gap, we propose CLEAR, a framework for radiology images that uses extracted embeddings from 2D slices along with attention-based aggregation for efficiently predicting clinical endpoints. As part of this framework, we introduce lesion-enhanced contrastive learning (LeCL), a novel approach to obtain visual representations driven by abnormalities in 2D axial slices across different locations of the CT scans. Specifically, we trained single-domain contrastive learning approaches using three different architectures: Vision Transformers, Vision State Space Models and Gated Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate our approach across three clinical tasks: tumor lesion location, lung disease detection, and patient staging, benchmarking against four state-of-the-art foundation models, including BiomedCLIP. Our findings demonstrate that CLEAR using representations learned through LeCL, outperforms existing foundation models, while being substantially more compute- and data-efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in video generation have significantly improved the realism and quality of created scenes. This has fueled interest in developing intuitive tools that let users leverage video generation as world simulators. Text-to-video (T2V) generation is one such approach, enabling video creation from text descriptions only. Yet, due to the inherent ambiguity in texts and the limited temporal information offered by text prompts, researchers have explored additional control signals like trajectory-guided systems, for more accurate T2V generation. Nonetheless, methods to evaluate whether T2V models can generate realistic interactions between multiple objects are lacking. We introduce InTraGen, a pipeline for improved trajectory-based generation of object interaction scenarios. We propose 4 new datasets and a novel trajectory quality metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed InTraGen. To achieve object interaction, we introduce a multi-modal interaction encoding pipeline with an object ID injection mechanism that enriches object-environment interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengeng Tang, Jiayi He, Lechao Cheng, Jingjing Wu, Dan Guo, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating continuous sign language videos from discrete segments is challenging due to the need for smooth transitions that preserve natural flow and meaning. Traditional approaches that simply concatenate isolated signs often result in abrupt transitions, disrupting video coherence. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Sign-D2C, that employs a conditional diffusion model to synthesize contextually smooth transition frames, enabling the seamless construction of continuous sign language sequences. Our approach transforms the unsupervised problem of transition frame generation into a supervised training task by simulating the absence of transition frames through random masking of segments in long-duration sign videos. The model learns to predict these masked frames by denoising Gaussian noise, conditioned on the surrounding sign observations, allowing it to handle complex, unstructured transitions. During inference, we apply a linearly interpolating padding strategy that initializes missing frames through interpolation between boundary frames, providing a stable foundation for iterative refinement by the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T, USTC-CSL100, and USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing continuous, natural sign language videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghe Zheng, Hongzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current era of rapid expansion in model scale, there is an increasing availability of open-source model weights for various tasks. However, the capabilities of a single fine-tuned model often fall short of meeting diverse deployment needs. Model merging has thus emerged as a widely focused method for efficiently building a single model tailored for multiple tasks combined from existing models. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task conflicts within the merged network. Our analysis of neural networks reveals that some task-specific information introduced by fine-tuning minimally enhances performance but heavily impacts generalization, leading to task conflicts. To mitigate the impact of this information, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that leverages frequency domain information to efficiently filter harmful specialized information, thereby minimizing the impact of task conflicts on the backbone with minimal cost. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free merging methods, we introduce a lightweight task-specific expert that can be dynamically integrated during inference to compensate for information loss. This framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with lightweight experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference speed, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to meet specific needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georg Hess, Carl Lindstr\"om, Maryam Fatemi, Christoffer Petersson, Lennart Svensson</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, requires extensive testing across diverse driving scenarios. Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes.

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaqi Zhao, Yuanyang Yin, Lin Li, Mingan Lin, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Siwei Chen, Weipeng Chen, Baoqun Yin, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Does seeing always mean knowing? Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrate separately pre-trained vision and language components, often using CLIP-ViT as vision backbone. However, these models frequently encounter a core issue of "cognitive misalignment" between the vision encoder (VE) and the large language model (LLM). Specifically, the VE's representation of visual information may not fully align with LLM's cognitive framework, leading to a mismatch where visual features exceed the language model's interpretive range. To address this, we investigate how variations in VE representations influence LVLM comprehension, especially when the LLM faces VE-Unknown data-images whose ambiguous visual representations challenge the VE's interpretive precision. Accordingly, we construct a multi-granularity landmark dataset and systematically examine the impact of VE-Known and VE-Unknown data on interpretive abilities. Our results show that VE-Unknown data limits LVLM's capacity for accurate understanding, while VE-Known data, rich in distinctive features, helps reduce cognitive misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose Entity-Enhanced Cognitive Alignment (EECA), a method that employs multi-granularity supervision to generate visually enriched, well-aligned tokens that not only integrate within the LLM's embedding space but also align with the LLM's cognitive framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqing Liu, Xianhang Li, Zeyu Wang, Bingchen Zhao, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous works show that noisy, web-crawled image-text pairs may limit vision-language pretraining like CLIP and propose learning with synthetic captions as a promising alternative. Our work continues this effort, introducing two simple yet effective designs to better leverage richly described synthetic captions. Firstly, by observing a strong inverse effect in learning with synthetic captions -- the short synthetic captions can generally lead to MUCH higher performance than full-length ones -- we therefore fed only partial synthetic captions to the text encoder. Secondly, we incorporate an autoregressive captioner to mimic the recaptioning process -- by conditioning on the paired image input and web-crawled text description, the captioner learns to predict the full-length synthetic caption generated by advanced MLLMs. Experiments show that our framework significantly improves zero-shot performance in cross-modal retrieval tasks, setting new SOTA results on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Moreover, such trained vision encoders can enhance the visual capability of LLaVA, showing strong improvements on a range of MLLM benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanhui Wang, Yihua Zhang, Ruizheng Bai, Yue Zhao, Sijia Liu, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made generative image editing more accessible, enabling creative edits but raising ethical concerns, particularly regarding malicious edits to human portraits that threaten privacy and identity security. Existing protection methods primarily rely on adversarial perturbations to nullify edits but often fail against diverse editing requests. We propose FaceLock, a novel approach to portrait protection that optimizes adversarial perturbations to destroy or significantly alter biometric information, rendering edited outputs biometrically unrecognizable. FaceLock integrates facial recognition and visual perception into perturbation optimization to provide robust protection against various editing attempts. We also highlight flaws in commonly used evaluation metrics and reveal how they can be manipulated, emphasizing the need for reliable assessments of protection. Experiments show FaceLock outperforms baselines in defending against malicious edits and is robust against purification techniques. Ablation studies confirm its stability and broad applicability across diffusion-based editing algorithms. Our work advances biometric defense and sets the foundation for privacy-preserving practices in image editing. The code is available at: https://github.com/taco-group/FaceLock.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Yao, Hao Gu, Xuweiyi Chen, Jiayun Wang, Zezhou Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we pioneer the study of open-vocabulary monocular 3D object detection, a novel task that aims to detect and localize objects in 3D space from a single RGB image without limiting detection to a predefined set of categories. We formalize this problem, establish baseline methods, and introduce a class-agnostic approach that leverages open-vocabulary 2D detectors and lifts 2D bounding boxes into 3D space. Our approach decouples the recognition and localization of objects in 2D from the task of estimating 3D bounding boxes, enabling generalization across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose a target-aware evaluation protocol to address inconsistencies in existing datasets, improving the reliability of model performance assessment. Extensive experiments on the Omni3D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in zero-shot 3D detection for novel object categories, validating its robust generalization capabilities. Our method and evaluation protocols contribute towards the development of open-vocabulary object detection models that can effectively operate in real-world, category-diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongwei Chen, Yushi Lan, Shangchen Zhou, Tengfei Wang, XIngang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success across various fields, from large language models (LLMs) to large multimodal models (LMMs) and 2D content generation, moving closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI). Despite these advances, applying autoregressive approaches to 3D object generation and understanding remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Scale AutoRegressive 3D (SAR3D), a novel framework that leverages a multi-scale 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) to tokenize 3D objects for efficient autoregressive generation and detailed understanding. By predicting the next scale in a multi-scale latent representation instead of the next single token, SAR3D reduces generation time significantly, achieving fast 3D object generation in just 0.82 seconds on an A6000 GPU. Additionally, given the tokens enriched with hierarchical 3D-aware information, we finetune a pretrained LLM on them, enabling multimodal comprehension of 3D content. Our experiments show that SAR3D surpasses current 3D generation methods in both speed and quality and allows LLMs to interpret and caption 3D models comprehensively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Cocchi, Nicholas Moratelli, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are the natural extension of large language models to handle multimodal inputs, combining text and image data. They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (ReflectiVA), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database. Tokens are trained following a two-stage two-model training recipe. This ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ReflectiVA for knowledge-based visual question answering, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16870">RECAST: Reparameterized, Compact weight Adaptation for Sequential Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazia Tasnim, Bryan A. Plummer</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental learning aims to adapt to new sets of categories over time with minimal computational overhead. Prior work often addresses this task by training efficient task-specific adaptors that modify frozen layer weights or features to capture relevant information without affecting predictions on previously learned categories. While these adaptors are generally more efficient than finetuning the entire network, they still require tens to hundreds of thousands of task-specific trainable parameters even for relatively small networks, making it challenging to operate on resource-constrained environments with high communication costs like edge devices or mobile phones. Thus, we propose Reparameterized, Compact weight Adaptation for Sequential Tasks (RECAST), a novel method that dramatically reduces task-specific trainable parameters to fewer than 50 - several orders of magnitude less than competing methods like LoRA. RECAST accomplishes this efficiency by learning to decompose layer weights into a soft parameter-sharing framework consisting of shared weight templates and very few module-specific scaling factors or coefficients. This soft parameter-sharing framework allows for effective task-wise reparameterization by tuning only these coefficients while keeping templates frozen.A key innovation of RECAST is the novel weight reconstruction pipeline called Neural Mimicry, which eliminates the need for pretraining from scratch. This allows for high-fidelity emulation of existing pretrained weights within our framework and provides quick adaptability to any model scale and architecture. Extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate RECAST outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 3% across various scales, architectures, and parameter spaces Moreover, we show that RECAST's architecture-agnostic nature allows for seamless integration with existing methods, further boosting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zequn Chen, Jiezhi Yang, Heng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PreF3R, Pose-Free Feed-forward 3D Reconstruction from an image sequence of variable length. Unlike previous approaches, PreF3R removes the need for camera calibration and reconstructs the 3D Gaussian field within a canonical coordinate frame directly from a sequence of unposed images, enabling efficient novel-view rendering. We leverage DUSt3R's ability for pair-wise 3D structure reconstruction, and extend it to sequential multi-view input via a spatial memory network, eliminating the need for optimization-based global alignment. Additionally, PreF3R incorporates a dense Gaussian parameter prediction head, which enables subsequent novel-view synthesis with differentiable rasterization. This allows supervising our model with the combination of photometric loss and pointmap regression loss, enhancing both photorealism and structural accuracy. Given a sequence of ordered images, PreF3R incrementally reconstructs the 3D Gaussian field at 20 FPS, therefore enabling real-time novel-view rendering. Empirical experiments demonstrate that PreF3R is an effective solution for the challenging task of pose-free feed-forward novel-view synthesis, while also exhibiting robust generalization to unseen scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunyi Li, Michael Niemeyer, Zeyu Chen, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve remarkable visual quality. While 3DGS and its variants can be rendered efficiently using rasterization, many tasks require access to the underlying 3D surface, which remains challenging to extract due to the sparse and explicit nature of this representation. In this paper, we introduce G2SDF, a novel approach that addresses this limitation by integrating a neural implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF) into the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our method links the opacity values of Gaussians with their distances to the surface, ensuring a closer alignment of Gaussians with the scene surface. To extend this approach to unbounded scenes at varying scales, we propose a normalization function that maps any range to a fixed interval. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we leverage an off-the-shelf depth estimator as pseudo ground truth during Gaussian Splatting optimization. By establishing a differentiable connection between the explicit Gaussians and the implicit SDF, our approach enables high-quality surface reconstruction and rendering. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that G2SDF achieves superior reconstruction quality than prior works while maintaining the efficiency of 3DGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdesselam Ferdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning is a widely employed strategy for accelerating deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, existing methods often necessitate modifications to the original architectures, involve complex implementations, and require lengthy fine-tuning stages. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-inspired approach that integrates the concept of gravity into the training stage of DCNNs. In this approach, the gravity is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the convolution filter and the attracting filter, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. We applied this force to the convolution filters, either drawing filters closer to the attracting filter (experiencing weaker gravity) toward non-zero weights or pulling filters farther away (subject to stronger gravity) toward zero weights. As a result, filters experiencing stronger gravity have their weights reduced to zero, enabling their removal, while filters under weaker gravity retain significant weights and preserve important information. Our method simultaneously optimizes the filter weights and ranks their importance, eliminating the need for complex implementations or extensive fine-tuning. We validated the proposed approach on popular DCNN architectures using the CIFAR dataset, achieving competitive results compared to existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional neural network-driven inpainting methods struggle to deliver high-quality results within the constraints of mobile device processing power and memory. Our research introduces an innovative approach to optimize memory usage by altering the composition of input data. Typically, video inpainting relies on a predetermined set of input frames, such as neighboring and reference frames, often limited to five-frame sets. Our focus is to examine how varying the proportion of these input frames impacts the quality of the inpainted video. By dynamically adjusting the input frame composition based on optical flow and changes of the mask, we have observed an improvement in various contents including rapid visual context changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andong Deng, Zhongpai Gao, Anwesa Choudhuri, Benjamin Planche, Meng Zheng, Bin Wang, Terrence Chen, Chen Chen, Ziyan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal awareness is essential for video large language models (LLMs) to understand and reason about events within long videos, enabling applications like dense video captioning and temporal video grounding in a unified system. However, the scarcity of long videos with detailed captions and precise temporal annotations limits their temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose Seq2Time, a data-oriented training paradigm that leverages sequences of images and short video clips to enhance temporal awareness in long videos. By converting sequence positions into temporal annotations, we transform large-scale image and clip captioning datasets into sequences that mimic the temporal structure of long videos, enabling self-supervised training with abundant time-sensitive data. To enable sequence-to-time knowledge transfer, we introduce a novel time representation that unifies positional information across image sequences, clip sequences, and long videos. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a 27.6% improvement in F1 score and 44.8% in CIDEr on the YouCook2 benchmark and a 14.7% increase in recall on the Charades-STA benchmark compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaira Manigrasso, Matteo Dunnhofer, Antonino Furnari, Moritz Nottebaum, Antonio Finocchiaro, Davide Marana, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Christian Micheloni</p>
<p>Abstract: Episodic memory retrieval aims to enable wearable devices with the ability to recollect from past video observations objects or events that have been observed (e.g., "where did I last see my smartphone?"). Despite the clear relevance of the task for a wide range of assistive systems, current task formulations are based on the "offline" assumption that the full video history can be accessed when the user makes a query, which is unrealistic in real settings, where wearable devices are limited in power and storage capacity. We introduce the novel task of Online Episodic Memory Visual Queries Localization (OEM-VQL), in which models are required to work in an online fashion, observing video frames only once and relying on past computations to answer user queries. To tackle this challenging task, we propose ESOM - Egocentric Streaming Object Memory, a novel framework based on an object discovery module to detect potentially interesting objects, a visual object tracker to track their position through the video in an online fashion, and a memory module to store spatio-temporal object coordinates and image representations, which can be queried efficiently at any moment. Comparisons with different baselines and offline methods show that OEM-VQL is challenging and ESOM is a viable approach to tackle the task, with results outperforming offline methods (81.92 vs 55.89 success rate %) when oracular object discovery and tracking are considered. Our analysis also sheds light on the limited performance of object detection and tracking in egocentric vision, providing a principled benchmark based on the OEM-VQL downstream task to assess progress in these areas.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16946">Lens Distortion Encoding System Version 1.0</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Maksymilian Fober</p>
<p>Abstract: Lens Distortion Encoding System (LDES) allows for a distortion-accurate workflow, with a seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of the lens source. This system is similar in a concept to the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), but for distortion. Presented solution is fully compatible with existing software/plug-in tools for STMapping found in popular production software like Adobe After Effects or DaVinci Resolve. LDES utilizes common distortion space and produces single high-quality, animatable STMap used for direct transformation of one view to another, neglecting the need of lens-swapping for each shoot. The LDES profile of a lens consist of two elements; View Map texture, and Footage Map texture, each labeled with the FOV value. Direct distortion mapping is produced by sampling of the Footage Map through the View Map. The result; animatable mapping texture, is then used to sample the footage to a desired distortion. While the Footage Map is specific to a footage, View Maps can be freely combined/transitioned and animated, allowing for effects like smooth shift from anamorphic to spherical distortion, previously impossible to achieve in practice. Presented LDES Version 1.0 uses common 32-bit STMap format for encoding, supported by most compositing software, directly or via plug-ins. The difference between standard STMap workflow and LDES is that it encodes absolute pixel position in the spherical image model. The main benefit of this approach is the ability to achieve a similar look of a highly expensive lens using some less expensive equipment in terms of distortion. It also provides greater artistic control and never seen before manipulation of footage.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces SAMatch, a SAM-guided Match-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, aimed at improving pseudo label quality in data-scarce scenarios. While Match-based frameworks are effective, they struggle with low-quality pseudo labels due to the absence of ground truth.

SAMatch is trained end-to-end, allowing for dynamic interaction between the models. Experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI, BUSI breast ultrasound, and MRLiver datasets show SAMatch achieving state-of-the-art results, with Dice scores of 89.36%, 77.76%, and 80.04%, respectively, using minimal labeled data.

<p>Abstract: Modeling temporal characteristics and the non-stationary dynamics of body movement plays a significant role in predicting human future motions. However, it is challenging to capture these features due to the subtle transitions involved in the complex human motions. This paper introduces MotionWavelet, a human motion prediction framework that utilizes Wavelet Transformation and studies human motion patterns in the spatial-frequency domain. In MotionWavelet, a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) learns a Wavelet Manifold by applying Wavelet Transformation on the motion data therefore encoding the intricate spatial and temporal motion patterns. Once the Wavelet Manifold is built, WDM trains a diffusion model to generate human motions from Wavelet latent vectors. In addition to the WDM, MotionWavelet also presents a Wavelet Space Shaping Guidance mechanism to refine the denoising process to improve conformity with the manifold structure. WDM also develops Temporal Attention-Based Guidance to enhance prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MotionWavelet, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and enhanced generalization across various benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikar Yellapragada, Alexandros Graikos, Kostas Triaridis, Prateek Prasanna, Rajarsi R. Gupta, Joel Saltz, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, yet several challenges restrict their application to large-image domains, such as digital pathology and satellite imagery. Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales, excelling particularly in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments. We provide high-resolution examples of the generated images on our website https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs/publications/zoomldm/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Integrated silicon photonic devices, which manipulate light to transmit and process information on a silicon-on-insulator chip, are highly sensitive to structural variations. Minor deviations during nanofabrication-the precise process of building structures at the nanometer scale-such as over- or under-etching, corner rounding, and unintended defects, can significantly impact performance. To address these challenges, we introduce SEMU-Net, a comprehensive set of methods that automatically segments scanning electron microscope images (SEM) and uses them to train two deep neural network models based on U-Net and its variants. The predictor model anticipates fabrication-induced variations, while the corrector model adjusts the design to address these issues, ensuring that the final fabricated structures closely align with the intended specifications. Experimental results show that the segmentation U-Net reaches an average IoU score of 99.30%, while the corrector attention U-Net in a tandem architecture achieves an average IoU score of 98.67%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Kamangir, Brent. S. Sams, Nick Dokoozlian, Luis Sanchez, J. Mason. Earles</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop yield prediction is essential for agricultural planning but remains challenging due to the complex interactions between weather, climate, and management practices. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning-based multi-model called Climate-Management Aware Vision Transformer (CMAViT), designed for pixel-level vineyard yield predictions. CMAViT integrates both spatial and temporal data by leveraging remote sensing imagery and short-term meteorological data, capturing the effects of growing season variations. Additionally, it incorporates management practices, which are represented in text form, using a cross-attention encoder to model their interaction with time-series data. This innovative multi-modal transformer tested on a large dataset from 2016-2019 covering 2,200 hectares and eight grape cultivars including more than 5 million vines, outperforms traditional models like UNet-ConvLSTM, excelling in spatial variability capture and yield prediction, particularly for extreme values in vineyards. CMAViT achieved an R2 of 0.84 and a MAPE of 8.22% on an unseen test dataset. Masking specific modalities lowered performance: excluding management practices, climate data, and both reduced R2 to 0.73, 0.70, and 0.72, respectively, and raised MAPE to 11.92%, 12.66%, and 12.39%, highlighting each modality's importance for accurate yield prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Bhardwaj, Ashwin Vinod, Soumojit Bhattacharya, Aryan Koganti, Aditya Sai Ellendula, Balakrishna Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud representation has gained traction due to its efficient memory usage and simplicity in acquisition, manipulation, and storage. However, as point cloud sizes increase, effective down-sampling becomes essential to address the computational requirements of downstream tasks. Classical approaches, such as furthest point sampling (FPS), perform well on benchmarks but rely on heuristics and overlook geometric features, like curvature, during down-sampling.
  In this paper, We introduce a reinforcement learning-based sampling algorithm that enhances FPS by integrating curvature information. Our approach ranks points by combining FPS-derived soft ranks with curvature scores computed by a deep neural network, allowing us to replace a proportion of low-curvature points in the FPS set with high-curvature points from the unselected set. Existing differentiable sampling techniques often suffer from training instability, hindering their integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. By contrast, our method achieves stable end-to-end learning, consistently outperforming baseline models across multiple downstream geometry processing tasks. We provide comprehensive ablation studies, with both qualitative and quantitative insights into the effect of each feature on performance. Our algorithm establishes state-of-the-art results for classification, segmentation and shape completion, showcasing its robustness and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb S. Spradlin, Jordan A. Caraballo-Vega, Jian Li, Mark L. Carroll, Jie Gong, Paul M. Montesano</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have the potential to transform the landscape of remote sensing (RS) data analysis by enabling large computer vision models to be pre-trained on vast amounts of remote sensing data. These models can then be fine-tuned with small amounts of labeled training and applied to a variety of applications. Most existing foundation models are designed for high spatial resolution, cloud-free satellite imagery or photos, limiting their applicability in scenarios that require frequent temporal monitoring or broad spectral profiles. As a result, foundation models trained solely on cloud-free images have limited utility for applications that involve atmospheric variables or require atmospheric corrections. We introduce SatVision-TOA, a novel foundation model pre-trained on 14-band MODIS L1B Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance imagery, addressing the need for models pre-trained to handle moderate- and coarse-resolution all-sky remote sensing data. The SatVision-TOA model is pre-trained using a Masked-Image-Modeling (MIM) framework and the SwinV2 architecture, and learns detailed contextual representations through self-supervised learning without the need for labels. It is a 3 billion parameter model that is trained on 100 million images. To our knowledge this is the largest foundation model trained solely on satellite RS imagery. Results show that SatVision-TOA achieves superior performance over baseline methods on downstream tasks such as 3D cloud retrieval. Notably, the model achieves a mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 0.46, a substantial improvement over the baseline mIOU of 0.22. Additionally, the rate of false negative results in the fine-tuning task were reduced by over 50% compared to the baseline. Our work advances pre-trained vision modeling for multispectral RS by learning from a variety of atmospheric and aerosol conditions to improve cloud and land surface monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shambhavi Mishra, Julio Silva-Rodr{\i}guez, Ismail Ben Ayed, Marco Pedersoli, Jose Dolz</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have shown unprecedented zero-shot performance across a wide range of tasks. Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we explore how to efficiently leverage class text information to mitigate these distribution drifts encountered by large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time inference. In particular, we propose to generate pseudo-labels for the test-time samples by exploiting generic class text embeddings as fixed centroids of a label assignment problem, which is efficiently solved with Optimal Transport. Furthermore, the proposed adaptation method (CLIP-OT) integrates a multiple template knowledge distillation approach, which replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning but without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of CLIP-OT, achieving performance gains of up to 7% over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally and memory efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenchen Wan, Yanwu Xu, Zhaoqing Wang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Virtual Try-On (VTO) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in generating realistic images and preserving garment details, largely attributed to the robust generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion backbones. However, the T2I models that underpin these methods have become outdated, thereby limiting the potential for further improvement in VTO. Additionally, current methods face notable challenges in accurately rendering text on garments without distortion and preserving fine-grained details, such as textures and material fidelity. The emergence of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based T2I models has showcased impressive performance and offers a promising opportunity for advancing VTO. Directly applying existing VTO techniques to transformer-based T2I models is ineffective due to substantial architectural differences, which hinder their ability to fully leverage the models' advanced capabilities for improved text generation. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of DiT-based T2I models for VTO, we propose TED-VITON, a novel framework that integrates a Garment Semantic (GS) Adapter for enhancing garment-specific features, a Text Preservation Loss to ensure accurate and distortion-free text rendering, and a constraint mechanism to generate prompts by optimizing Large Language Model (LLM). These innovations enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in visual quality and text fidelity, establishing a new benchmark for VTO task.</p>

<p>Abstract: The classification of road signs by autonomous systems, especially those reliant on visual inputs, is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Traditional approaches to mitigating such vulnerabilities have focused on enhancing the robustness of classification models. In contrast, this paper adopts a fundamentally different strategy aimed at increasing robustness through the redesign of road signs themselves. We propose an attacker-agnostic learning scheme to automatically design road signs that are robust to a wide array of patch-based attacks. Empirical tests conducted in both digital and physical environments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces vulnerability to patch attacks, outperforming existing techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report summarizes the second-place solution for the Predictive World Model Challenge held at the CVPR-2024 Workshop on Foundation Models for Autonomous Systems. We introduce D$^2$-World, a novel World model that effectively forecasts future point clouds through Decoupled Dynamic flow. Specifically, the past semantic occupancies are obtained via existing occupancy networks (e.g., BEVDet). Following this, the occupancy results serve as the input for a single-stage world model, generating future occupancy in a non-autoregressive manner. To further simplify the task, dynamic voxel decoupling is performed in the world model. The model generates future dynamic voxels by warping the existing observations through voxel flow, while remaining static voxels can be easily obtained through pose transformation. As a result, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenScene Predictive World Model benchmark, securing second place, and trains more than 300% faster than the baseline model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Gim Hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Generalizable 3D-Language Feature Fields (g3D-LF), a 3D representation model pre-trained on large-scale 3D-language dataset for embodied tasks. Our g3D-LF processes posed RGB-D images from agents to encode feature fields for: 1) Novel view representation predictions from any position in the 3D scene; 2) Generations of BEV maps centered on the agent; 3) Querying targets using multi-granularity language within the above-mentioned representations. Our representation can be generalized to unseen environments, enabling real-time construction and dynamic updates. By volume rendering latent features along sampled rays and integrating semantic and spatial relationships through multiscale encoders, our g3D-LF produces representations at different scales and perspectives, aligned with multi-granularity language, via multi-level contrastive learning. Furthermore, we prepare a large-scale 3D-language dataset to align the representations of the feature fields with language. Extensive experiments on Vision-and-Language Navigation under both Panorama and Monocular settings, Zero-shot Object Navigation, and Situated Question Answering tasks highlight the significant advantages and effectiveness of our g3D-LF for embodied tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemin Kim, Bryan S Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks like text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependency across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions or are constrained to limited prompts, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose Free$^2$Guide, a novel gradient-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts without requiring additional model training. Leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward model. Additionally, our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models, including large-scale image-based models, to synergistically enhance alignment without incurring substantial computational overhead. We demonstrate that Free$^2$Guide significantly improves text alignment across various dimensions and enhances the overall quality of generated videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woong Oh Cho, In Cho, Seoha Kim, Jeongmin Bae, Youngjung Uh, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian methods for dynamic scene reconstruction offer high visual fidelity and fast rendering. However, these methods suffer from excessive memory and storage demands, which limits their practical deployment. This paper proposes a 4D anchor-based framework that retains visual quality and rendering speed of 4D Gaussians while significantly reducing storage costs. Our method extends 3D scaffolding to 4D space, and leverages sparse 4D grid-aligned anchors with compressed feature vectors. Each anchor models a set of neural 4D Gaussians, each of which represent a local spatiotemporal region. In addition, we introduce a temporal coverage-aware anchor growing strategy to effectively assign additional anchors to under-reconstructed dynamic regions. Our method adjusts the accumulated gradients based on Gaussians' temporal coverage, improving reconstruction quality in dynamic regions. To reduce the number of anchors, we further present enhanced formulations of neural 4D Gaussians. These include the neural velocity, and the temporal opacity derived from a generalized Gaussian distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and 97.8% storage reduction over 4DGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh-Tuan Tran, Trung Le, Xuan-May Le, Jianfei Cai, Mehrtash Harandi, Dinh Phung</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is an advanced technique that enables knowledge transfer from a teacher model to a student model without relying on original training data. While DFKD methods have achieved success on smaller datasets like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, they encounter challenges on larger, high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. A primary issue with previous approaches is their generation of synthetic images at high resolutions (e.g., $224 \times 224$) without leveraging information from real images, often resulting in noisy images that lack essential class-specific features in large datasets. Additionally, the computational cost of generating the extensive data needed for effective knowledge transfer can be prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce MUlti-reSolution data-freE (MUSE) to address these limitations. MUSE generates images at lower resolutions while using Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to ensure that the generated images retain critical, class-specific features. To further enhance model diversity, we propose multi-resolution generation and embedding diversity techniques that strengthen latent space representations, leading to significant performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MUSE achieves state-of-the-art performance across both small- and large-scale datasets, with notable performance gains of up to two digits in nearly all ImageNet and subset experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengjia Li, Haonan Qiu, Shiwei Zhang, Xiang Wang, Yujie Wei, Zekun Li, Yingya Zhang, Boxi Wu, Deng Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: The current text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic general videos, but it is still under-explored in identity-specific human video generation with customized ID images. The key challenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving the original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity injection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on reconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a divergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a tuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed \textbf{PersonalVideo}, that applies direct supervision on videos synthesized by the T2V model to bridge the gap. Specifically, we introduce a learnable Isolated Identity Adapter to customize the specific identity non-intrusively, which does not comprise the original T2V model's abilities (e.g., motion dynamic and semantic following). With the non-reconstructive identity loss, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting by supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good robustness even with only a single reference image available. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in delivering high identity faithfulness while preserving the inherent video generation qualities of the original T2V model, outshining prior approaches. Notably, our PersonalVideo seamlessly integrates with pre-trained SD components, such as ControlNet and style LoRA, requiring no extra tuning overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoan Xu, Jiaming Chen, Wenfeng Huang, Wenjing Jia, Guangwei Gao, Guo-Jun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved notable success in computer vision, with its variants extensively validated across various downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation. However, designed as general-purpose visual encoders, ViT backbones often overlook the specific needs of task decoders, revealing opportunities to design decoders tailored to efficient semantic segmentation. This paper proposes Strip Cross-Attention (SCASeg), an innovative decoder head explicitly designed for semantic segmentation. Instead of relying on the simple conventional skip connections, we employ lateral connections between the encoder and decoder stages, using encoder features as Queries for the cross-attention modules. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Layer Block that blends hierarchical feature maps from different encoder and decoder stages to create a unified representation for Keys and Values. To further boost computational efficiency, SCASeg compresses queries and keys into strip-like patterns to optimize memory usage and inference speed over the traditional vanilla cross-attention. Moreover, the Cross-Layer Block incorporates the local perceptual strengths of convolution, enabling SCASeg to capture both global and local context dependencies across multiple layers. This approach facilitates effective feature interaction at different scales, improving the overall performance. Experiments show that the adaptable decoder of SCASeg produces competitive performance across different setups, surpassing leading segmentation architectures on all benchmark datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff 164k, and Pascal VOC2012, even under varying computational limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colin Conwell, Rupert Tawiah-Quashie, Tomer Ullman</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in multi-modal AI research, there is a salient domain in which modern AI continues to lag considerably behind even human children: the reliable deployment of logical operators. Here, we examine three forms of logical operators: relations, negations, and discrete numbers. We asked human respondents (N=178 in total) to evaluate images generated by a state-of-the-art image-generating AI (DALL-E 3) prompted with these `logical probes', and find that none reliably produce human agreement scores greater than 50\%. The negation probes and numbers (beyond 3) fail most frequently. In a 4th experiment, we assess a `grounded diffusion' pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering and structured intermediate representations for greater compositional control, but find its performance is judged even worse than that of DALL-E 3 across prompts. To provide further clarity on potential sources of success and failure in these text-to-image systems, we supplement our 4 core experiments with multiple auxiliary analyses and schematic diagrams, directly quantifying, for example, the relationship between the N-gram frequency of relational prompts and the average match to generated images; the success rates for 3 different prompt modification strategies in the rendering of negation prompts; and the scalar variability / ratio dependence (`approximate numeracy') of prompts involving integers. We conclude by discussing the limitations inherent to `grounded' multimodal learning systems whose grounding relies heavily on vector-based semantics (e.g. DALL-E 3), or under-specified syntactical constraints (e.g. `grounded diffusion'), and propose minimal modifications (inspired by development, based in imagery) that could help to bridge the lingering compositional gap between scale and structure.

<p>Abstract: Geometric reconstruction of opaque surfaces from images is a longstanding challenge in computer vision, with renewed interest from volumetric view synthesis algorithms using radiance fields. We leverage the geometry field proposed in recent work for stochastic opaque surfaces, which can then be converted to volume densities. We adapt Gaussian kernels or surfels to splat the geometry field rather than the volume, enabling precise reconstruction of opaque solids. Our first contribution is to derive an efficient and almost exact differentiable rendering algorithm for geometry fields parameterized by Gaussian surfels, while removing current approximations involving Taylor series and no self-attenuation. Next, we address the discontinuous loss landscape when surfels cluster near geometry, showing how to guarantee that the rendered color is a continuous function of the colors of the kernels, irrespective of ordering. Finally, we use latent representations with spherical harmonics encoded reflection vectors rather than spherical harmonics encoded colors to better address specular surfaces. We demonstrate significant improvement in the quality of reconstructed 3D surfaces on widely-used datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate diagnosis and prognosis assisted by pathology images are essential for cancer treatment selection and planning. Despite the recent trend of adopting deep-learning approaches for analyzing complex pathology images, they fall short as they often overlook the domain-expert understanding of tissue structure and cell composition. In this work, we focus on a challenging Open-ended Pathology VQA (PathVQA-Open) task and propose a novel framework named Path-RAG, which leverages HistoCartography to retrieve relevant domain knowledge from pathology images and significantly improves performance on PathVQA-Open. Admitting the complexity of pathology image analysis, Path-RAG adopts a human-centered AI approach by retrieving domain knowledge using HistoCartography to select the relevant patches from pathology images. Our experiments suggest that domain guidance can significantly boost the accuracy of LLaVA-Med from 38% to 47%, with a notable gain of 28% for H&E-stained pathology images in the PathVQA-Open dataset. For longer-form question and answer pairs, our model consistently achieves significant improvements of 32.5% in ARCH-Open PubMed and 30.6% in ARCH-Open Books on H\&E images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Li, Yu Wang, Ce Zhang, Yongjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Terraced field is a significant engineering practice for soil and water conservation (SWC). Terraced field extraction from remotely sensed imagery is the foundation for monitoring and evaluating SWC. This study is the first to propose a novel dual-modal {\Omega}-like super-resolution Transformer network for intelligent TFVE, offering the following advantages: (1) reducing edge segmentation error from conventional multi-scale downsampling encoder, through fusing original high-resolution features with downsampling features at each step of encoder and leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism; (2) improving the accuracy of TFVE by proposing a {\Omega}-like network structure, which fully integrates rich high-level features from both spectral and terrain data to form cross-scale super-resolution features; (3) validating an optimal fusion scheme for cross-modal and cross-scale (i.e., inconsistent spatial resolution between remotely sensed imagery and DEM) super-resolution feature extraction; (4) mitigating uncertainty between segmentation edge pixels by a coarse-to-fine and spatial topological semantic relationship optimization (STSRO) segmentation strategy; (5) leveraging contour vibration neural network to continuously optimize parameters and iteratively vectorize terraced fields from semantic segmentation results. Moreover, a DMRVD for deep-learning-based TFVE was created for the first time, which covers nine study areas in four provinces of China, with a total coverage area of 22441 square kilometers. To assess the performance of {\Omega}SFormer, classic and SOTA networks were compared. The mIOU of {\Omega}SFormer has improved by 0.165, 0.297 and 0.128 respectively, when compared with best accuracy single-modal remotely sensed imagery, single-modal DEM and dual-modal result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Zhu, Jianze Li, Haotong Qin, Yulun Zhang, Yong Guo, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have shown superior performance at the cost of multiple denoising steps. However, even though the denoising step has been reduced to one, they require high computational costs and storage requirements, making it difficult for deployment on hardware devices. To address these issues, we propose a novel post-training quantization approach with adaptive scale in one-step diffusion (OSD) image SR, PassionSR. First, we simplify OSD model to two core components, UNet and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by removing the CLIPEncoder. Secondly, we propose Learnable Boundary Quantizer (LBQ) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET) to optimize the quantization process and manipulate activation distributions for better quantization. Finally, we design a Distributed Quantization Calibration (DQC) strategy that stabilizes the training of quantized parameters for rapid convergence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PassionSR with 8-bit and 6-bit obtains comparable visual results with full-precision model. Moreover, our PassionSR achieves significant advantages over recent leading low-bit quantization methods for image SR. Our code will be at https://github.com/libozhu03/PassionSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nouar AlDahoul, Myles Joshua Toledo Tan, Harishwar Reddy Kasireddy, Yasir Zaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread dissemination of hate speech, harassment, harmful and sexual content, and violence across websites and media platforms presents substantial challenges and provokes widespread concern among different sectors of society. Governments, educators, and parents are often at odds with media platforms about how to regulate, control, and limit the spread of such content. Technologies for detecting and censoring the media contents are a key solution to addressing these challenges. Techniques from natural language processing and computer vision have been used widely to automatically identify and filter out sensitive content such as offensive languages, violence, nudity, and addiction in both text, images, and videos, enabling platforms to enforce content policies at scale. However, existing methods still have limitations in achieving high detection accuracy with fewer false positives and false negatives. Therefore, more sophisticated algorithms for understanding the context of both text and image may open rooms for improvement in content censorship to build a more efficient censorship system. In this paper, we evaluate existing LLM-based content moderation solutions such as OpenAI moderation model and Llama-Guard3 and study their capabilities to detect sensitive contents. Additionally, we explore recent LLMs such as GPT, Gemini, and Llama in identifying inappropriate contents across media outlets. Various textual and visual datasets like X tweets, Amazon reviews, news articles, human photos, cartoons, sketches, and violence videos have been utilized for evaluation and comparison. The results demonstrate that LLMs outperform traditional techniques by achieving higher accuracy and lower false positive and false negative rates. This highlights the potential to integrate LLMs into websites, social media platforms, and video-sharing services for regulatory and content moderation purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinan Zhou, Yuxin Chen, Haokun Lin, Shuyu Yang, Li Zhu, Zhongang Qi, Chen Ma, Ying Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have increasingly emphasized grounding and referring capabilities to achieve detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, in the realm of visual document understanding, these capabilities lag behind due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Eferring data engine (DOGE-Engine), which produces two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: multi-granular parsing data for enhancing fundamental text localization and recognition capabilities; and instruction-tuning data to activate MLLM's grounding and referring capabilities during dialogue and reasoning. Additionally, using our engine, we construct DOGE-Bench, which encompasses 7 grounding and referring tasks across 3 document types (chart, poster, PDF document), providing comprehensive evaluations for fine-grained document understanding. Furthermore, leveraging the data generated by our engine, we develop a strong baseline model, DOGE. This pioneering MLLM is capable of accurately referring and grounding texts at multiple granularities within document images. Our code, data, and model will be open-sourced for community development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan-Ming Li, An-Lan Wang, Kun-Yu Lin, Yu-Ming Tang, Ling-An Zeng, Jian-Fang Hu, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: To guide a learner to master the action skills, it is crucial for a coach to 1) reason through the learner's action execution and technical keypoints, and 2) provide detailed, understandable feedback on what is done well and what can be improved. However, existing score-based action assessment methods are still far from this practical scenario. To bridge this gap, we investigate a new task termed Descriptive Action Coaching (DAC) which requires a model to provide detailed commentary on what is done well and what can be improved beyond a quality score from an action execution. To this end, we construct a new dataset named EE4D-DAC. With an LLM-based annotation pipeline, our dataset goes beyond the existing action assessment datasets by providing the hierarchical coaching commentary at both keypoint and instance levels. Furthermore, we propose TechCoach, a new framework that explicitly incorporates keypoint-level reasoning into the DAC process. The central to our method lies in the Context-aware Keypoint Reasoner, which enables TechCoach to learn keypoint-related quality representations by querying visual context under the supervision of keypoint-level coaching commentary. Prompted by the visual context and the keypoint-related quality representations, a unified Keypoint-aware Action Assessor is then employed to provide the overall coaching commentary together with the quality score. Combining all of these, we build a new benchmark for DAC and evaluate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments. Data and code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Crack detection plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and safety of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, as timely identification of structural damage can prevent accidents and reduce costly repairs. Traditionally, manual inspection has been the norm, but it is labor-intensive, subjective, and hazardous. This paper introduces an advanced approach for crack detection in infrastructure using deep learning, leveraging transfer learning, spatial attention mechanisms, and genetic algorithm(GA) optimization. To address the challenge of the inaccessability of large amount of data, we employ ResNet50 as a pre-trained model, utilizing its strong feature extraction capabilities while reducing the need for extensive training datasets. We enhance the model with a spatial attention layer as well as a customized neural network which architecture was fine-tuned using GA. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Attention-ResNet50-GA model, achieving a precision of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9983, outperforming conventional methods. The results highlight the model's ability to accurately detect cracks in various conditions, making it highly suitable for real-world applications where large annotated datasets are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zheng, Haiwei Xue, Jialei Chen, Yibo Yan, Lutao Jiang, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Kailun Yang, Linfeng Zhang, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneously using multimodal inputs from multiple sensors to train segmentors is intuitively advantageous but practically challenging. A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanyoung Kim, Dayun Ju, Woojung Han, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijin Jia, Ziang Luo, Tuopu Wen, Mengmeng Yang, Kun Jiang, Le Cui, Diange Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent advances in lane segment perception provide autonomous vehicles with a comprehensive understanding of driving scenarios. Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingkai Wang, Jue Gong, Lin Zhang, Zheng Chen, Xing Liu, Hong Gu, Yutong Liu, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in face restoration. Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious, realistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose OSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically, we propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior information and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are processed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a vector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we incorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further ensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the restored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that OSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images with high identity consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juefei He, Yuexing Peng, Wei Li, Junchuan Yu, Daqing Ge, Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Relic landslide, formed over a long period, possess the potential for reactivation, making them a hazardous geological phenomenon. While reliable relic landslide detection benefits the effective monitoring and prevention of landslide disaster, semantic segmentation using high-resolution remote sensing images for relic landslides faces many challenges, including the object visual blur problem, due to the changes of appearance caused by prolonged natural evolution and human activities, and the small-sized dataset problem, due to difficulty in recognizing and labelling the samples. To address these challenges, a semantic segmentation model, termed mask-recovering and interactive-feature-enhancing (MRIFE), is proposed for more efficient feature extraction and separation. Specifically, a contrastive learning and mask reconstruction method with locally significant feature enhancement is proposed to improve the ability to distinguish between the target and background and represent landslide semantic features. Meanwhile, a dual-branch interactive feature enhancement architecture is used to enrich the extracted features and address the issue of visual ambiguity. Self-distillation learning is introduced to leverage the feature diversity both within and between samples for contrastive learning, improving sample utilization, accelerating model convergence, and effectively addressing the problem of the small-sized dataset. The proposed MRIFE is evaluated on a real relic landslide dataset, and experimental results show that it greatly improves the performance of relic landslide detection. For the semantic segmentation task, compared to the baseline, the precision increases from 0.4226 to 0.5347, the mean intersection over union (IoU) increases from 0.6405 to 0.6680, the landslide IoU increases from 0.3381 to 0.3934, and the F1-score increases from 0.5054 to 0.5646.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liu, Shibei Xue, Dezong Zhao, Shan Ma, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: 6D object pose estimation is crucial for robotic perception and precise manipulation. Occlusion and incomplete object visibility are common challenges in this task, but existing pose refinement methods often struggle to handle these issues effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose a global motion-guided recurrent flow estimation method called GMFlow for pose estimation. GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios. Experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generative models, users often face a trial-and-error challenge in practical scenarios. This challenge arises from the complexity and uncertainty of tedious steps such as crafting suitable prompts, selecting appropriate models, and configuring specific arguments, making users resort to labor-intensive attempts for desired images. This paper proposes Automatic T2I generation, which aims to automate these tedious steps, allowing users to simply describe their needs in a freestyle chatting way. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce ChatGenBench, a novel benchmark designed for Automatic T2I. It features high-quality paired data with diverse freestyle inputs, enabling comprehensive evaluation of automatic T2I models across all steps. Additionally, recognizing Automatic T2I as a complex multi-step reasoning task, we propose ChatGen-Evo, a multi-stage evolution strategy that progressively equips models with essential automation skills. Through extensive evaluation across step-wise accuracy and image quality, ChatGen-Evo significantly enhances performance over various baselines. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights for advancing automatic T2I. All our data, code, and models will be available in \url{https://chengyou-jia.github.io/ChatGen-Home}</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) has emerged as a promising approach in image generation, offering competitive potential and performance comparable to diffusion-based models. However, current AR-based visual generation models require substantial computational resources, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To address this issue, we conducted analysis and identified significant redundancy in three dimensions of the VAR model: (1) the attention map, (2) the attention outputs when using classifier free guidance, and (3) the data precision. Correspondingly, we proposed efficient attention mechanism and low-bit quantization method to enhance the efficiency of VAR models while maintaining performance. With negligible performance lost (less than 0.056 FID increase), we could achieve 85.2% reduction in attention computation, 50% reduction in overall memory and 1.5x latency reduction. To ensure deployment feasibility, we developed efficient training-free compression techniques and analyze the deployment feasibility and efficiency gain of each technique.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many real-world user queries (e.g. "How do to make egg fried rice?") could benefit from systems capable of generating responses with both textual steps with accompanying images, similar to a cookbook. Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels. To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent employing a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PhysMotion, a novel framework that leverages principled physics-based simulations to guide intermediate 3D representations generated from a single image and input conditions (e.g., applied force and torque), producing high-quality, physically plausible video generation. By utilizing continuum mechanics-based simulations as a prior knowledge, our approach addresses the limitations of traditional data-driven generative models and result in more consistent physically plausible motions. Our framework begins by reconstructing a feed-forward 3D Gaussian from a single image through geometry optimization. This representation is then time-stepped using a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) with continuum mechanics-based elastoplasticity models, which provides a strong foundation for realistic dynamics, albeit at a coarse level of detail. To enhance the geometry, appearance and ensure spatiotemporal consistency, we refine the initial simulation using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model with cross-frame attention, resulting in a physically plausible video that retains intricate details comparable to the input image. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to validate the efficacy of our method.

<p>Abstract: We propose SelfSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to perform pose-free and 3D prior-free generalizable 3D reconstruction from unposed multi-view images. These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Wang, Mengxiao Huang, Harry Cheng, Xiao Zhang, Zhiqi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake facial manipulation has garnered significant public attention due to its impacts on enhancing human experiences and posing privacy threats. Despite numerous passive algorithms that have been attempted to thwart malicious Deepfake attacks, they mostly struggle with the generalizability challenge when confronted with hyper-realistic synthetic facial images. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a proactive Deepfake detection approach by introducing a novel training-free landmark perceptual watermark, LampMark for short. We first analyze the structure-sensitive characteristics of Deepfake manipulations and devise a secure and confidential transformation pipeline from the structural representations, i.e. facial landmarks, to binary landmark perceptual watermarks. Subsequently, we present an end-to-end watermarking framework that imperceptibly and robustly embeds and extracts watermarks concerning the images to be protected. Relying on promising watermark recovery accuracies, Deepfake detection is accomplished by assessing the consistency between the content-matched landmark perceptual watermark and the robustly recovered watermark of the suspect image. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in watermark recovery and Deepfake detection compared to state-of-the-art methods across in-dataset, cross-dataset, and cross-manipulation scenarios.</p>

Moreover, the feature perception within a fixed-size window of existing models restricts the effective receptive fields and the intermediate feature diversity. This study demonstrates that a flexible integration of attention across diverse spatial extents can yield significant performance enhancements. In line with this insight, we introduce Multi-Range Attention Transformer (MAT) tailored for SR tasks. MAT leverages the computational advantages inherent in dilation operation, in conjunction with self-attention mechanism, to facilitate both multi-range attention (MA) and sparse multi-range attention (SMA), enabling efficient capture of both regional and sparse global features. Further coupled with local feature extraction, MAT adeptly capture dependencies across various spatial ranges, improving the diversity and efficacy of its feature representations. We also introduce the MSConvStar module, which augments the model's ability for multi-range representation learning. Comprehensive experiments show that our MAT exhibits superior performance to existing state-of-the-art SR models with remarkable efficiency (~3.3 faster than SRFormer-light).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui-Yue Yang, Hui Chen, Ao Wang, Kai Chen, Zijia Lin, Yongliang Tang, Pengcheng Gao, Yuming Quan, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great progress in anomaly segmentation tasks due to its impressive generalization ability. However, existing methods that directly apply SAM through prompting often overlook the domain shift issue, where SAM performs well on natural images but struggles in industrial scenarios. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a promising solution, but it may yield suboptimal performance by not adequately addressing the perception challenges during adaptation to anomaly images. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Perceptinon Tuning (SPT) method, aiming to enhance SAM's perception capability for anomaly segmentation. The SPT method incorporates a self-drafting tuning strategy, which generates an initial coarse draft of the anomaly mask, followed by a refinement process. Additionally, a visual-relation-aware adapter is introduced to improve the perception of discriminative relational information for mask generation. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method can significantly outperform baseline methods, validating its effectiveness. Models and codes will be available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Wang, Huiyu Duan, Guangtao Zhai, Juntong Wang, Xiongkuo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs) has led to the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence generated videos (AIGVs), which highlights the pressing need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) models designed specifically for AIGVs. Current VQA models generally fall short in accurately assessing the perceptual quality of AIGVs due to the presence of unique distortions, such as unrealistic objects, unnatural movements, or inconsistent visual elements. To address this challenge, we first present AIGVQA-DB, a large-scale dataset comprising 36,576 AIGVs generated by 15 advanced text-to-video models using 1,048 diverse prompts. With these AIGVs, a systematic annotation pipeline including scoring and ranking processes is devised, which collects 370k expert ratings to date. Based on AIGVQA-DB, we further introduce AIGV-Assessor, a novel VQA model that leverages spatiotemporal features and LMM frameworks to capture the intricate quality attributes of AIGVs, thereby accurately predicting precise video quality scores and video pair preferences. Through comprehensive experiments on both AIGVQA-DB and existing AIGV databases, AIGV-Assessor demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing scoring or evaluation methods in terms of multiple perceptual quality dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Yang, Pengxiang Li, Lu Zhang, Liqian Ma, Ping Hu, Siyu Du, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Subject-driven image inpainting has emerged as a popular task in image editing alongside recent advancements in diffusion models. Previous methods primarily focus on identity preservation but struggle to maintain the editability of inserted objects. In response, this paper introduces DreamMix, a diffusion-based generative model adept at inserting target objects into given scenes at user-specified locations while concurrently enabling arbitrary text-driven modifications to their attributes. In particular, we leverage advanced foundational inpainting models and introduce a disentangled local-global inpainting framework to balance precise local object insertion with effective global visual coherence. Additionally, we propose an Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) and a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module to improve the diversity and discriminative capability of the text-based attribute guidance, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamMix effectively balances identity preservation and attribute editability across various application scenarios, including object insertion, attribute editing, and small object inpainting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoxi Zhu, Zhengzhong Tu, Jiaming Liu, Alan C. Bovik, Yibo Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Restoring images captured under adverse weather conditions is a fundamental task for many computer vision applications. However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

<p>Abstract: Current methods for extracting intrinsic image components, such as reflectance and shading, primarily rely on statistical priors. These methods focus mainly on simple synthetic scenes and isolated objects and struggle to perform well on challenging real-world data. To address this issue, we propose MLI-NeRF, which integrates \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{L}ight information in \textbf{I}ntrinsic-aware \textbf{Ne}ural \textbf{R}adiance \textbf{F}ields. By leveraging scene information provided by different light source positions complementing the multi-view information, we generate pseudo-label images for reflectance and shading to guide intrinsic image decomposition without the need for ground truth data. Our method introduces straightforward supervision for intrinsic component separation and ensures robustness across diverse scene types. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we demonstrate its applicability to various image editing tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Xun Zhang, Wenbo Li, Renjing Pei, Fenglong Song, Xiongkuo Min, Xiaohong Liu, Xin Yuan, Yong Guo, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/Grounding-IQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Deng, Wei Yin, Xiaoyang Guo, Qian Zhang, Xiaotao Hu, Weiqiang Ren, Xiaoxiao Long, Ping Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> JiHwan Moon, Jihoon Park, Jungeun Kim, Jongseong Bae, Hyeongwoo Jeon, Ha Young Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is challenging, as it involves converting sign language videos into natural language. Previous studies have prioritized accuracy over diversity. However, diversity is crucial for handling lexical and syntactic ambiguities in machine translation, suggesting it could similarly benefit SLT. In this work, we propose DiffSLT, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages a diffusion model, enabling diverse translations while preserving sign language semantics. DiffSLT transforms random noise into the target latent representation, conditioned on the visual features of input video. To enhance visual conditioning, we design Guidance Fusion Module, which fully utilizes the multi-level spatiotemporal information of the visual features. We also introduce DiffSLT-P, a DiffSLT variant that conditions on pseudo-glosses and visual features, providing key textual guidance and reducing the modality gap. As a result, DiffSLT and DiffSLT-P significantly improve diversity over previous gloss-free SLT methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two SLT datasets, thereby markedly improving translation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Buffer Anytime, a framework for estimation of depth and normal maps (which we call geometric buffers) from video that eliminates the need for paired video--depth and video--normal training data. Instead of relying on large-scale annotated video datasets, we demonstrate high-quality video buffer estimation by leveraging single-image priors with temporal consistency constraints. Our zero-shot training strategy combines state-of-the-art image estimation models based on optical flow smoothness through a hybrid loss function, implemented via a lightweight temporal attention architecture. Applied to leading image models like Depth Anything V2 and Marigold-E2E-FT, our approach significantly improves temporal consistency while maintaining accuracy. Experiments show that our method not only outperforms image-based approaches but also achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art video models trained on large-scale paired video datasets, despite using no such paired video data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Soudeep, M. F. Mridha, Md Abrar Jahin, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and tracking of small objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes are critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial in improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showcasing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This work provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition has a wide application prospect in social robotics, health care, driver fatigue monitoring, and many other practical scenarios. Automatic recognition of facial expressions has been extensively studied by the Computer Vision research society. But Facial Expression Recognition in real-world is still a challenging task, partially due to the long-tailed distribution of the dataset. Many recent studies use data augmentation for Long-Tailed Recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic augmentation method. By introducing randomness into the encoding of the source data in the latent space of VAE-GAN, new samples are generated. Then, for facial expression recognition in RAF-DB dataset, we use our augmentation method to balance the long-tailed distribution. Our method can be used in not only FER tasks, but also more diverse data-hungry scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details; and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Om Suhas Deshmukh, Sankalp Nagaonkar, Achyut Mani Tripathi, Ashish Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: The newly introduced Visual State Space Model (VMamba), which employs \textit{State Space Mechanisms} (SSM) to interpret images as sequences of patches, has shown exceptional performance compared to Vision Transformers (ViT) across various computer vision tasks. However, recent studies have highlighted that deep models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. One common approach is to embed a trigger in the training data to retrain the model, causing it to misclassify data samples into a target class, a phenomenon known as a backdoor attack. In this paper, we first evaluate the robustness of the VMamba model against existing backdoor attacks. Based on this evaluation, we introduce a novel architectural backdoor attack, termed BadScan, designed to deceive the VMamba model. This attack utilizes bit plane slicing to create visually imperceptible backdoored images. During testing, if a trigger is detected by performing XOR operations between the $k^{th}$ bit planes of the modified triggered patches, the traditional 2D selective scan (SS2D) mechanism in the visual state space (VSS) block of VMamba is replaced with our newly designed BadScan block, which incorporates four newly developed scanning patterns. We demonstrate that the BadScan backdoor attack represents a significant threat to visual state space models and remains effective even after complete retraining from scratch. Experimental results on two widely used image classification datasets, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-1K, reveal that while visual state space models generally exhibit robustness against current backdoor attacks, the BadScan attack is particularly effective, achieving a higher Triggered Accuracy Ratio (TAR) in misleading the VMamba model and its variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Akl, Abdelwahed Khamis, Zhe Wang, Ali Cheraghian, Sara Khalifa, Kewen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are known for their poor performance in out-of-distribution datasets. An issue that was addressed in previous works through ensemble learning, answer re-ranking, or artificially growing the training set. In this work, we show for the first time that robust Visual Question Answering is attainable by simply enhancing the training strategy. Our proposed approach, Task Progressive Curriculum Learning (TPCL), breaks the main VQA problem into smaller, easier tasks based on the question type. Then, it progressively trains the model on a (carefully crafted) sequence of tasks. We further support the method by a novel distributional-based difficulty measurer. Our approach is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement. We demonstrate TPCL effectiveness through a comprehensive evaluation on standard datasets. Without either data augmentation or explicit debiasing mechanism, it achieves state-of-the-art on VQA-CP v2, VQA-CP v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TPCL outperforms the most competitive robust VQA approaches by more than 5% and 7% on VQA-CP v2 and VQA-CP v1; respectively. TPCL also can boost VQA baseline backbone performance by up to 28.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedrana Krivokuca Hahn, Jeremy Maceiras, Alain Komaty, Philip Abbet, Sebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: We present three biometric datasets (iCarB-Face, iCarB-Fingerprint, iCarB-Voice) containing face videos, fingerprint images, and voice samples, collected inside a car from 200 consenting volunteers. The data was acquired using a near-infrared camera, two fingerprint scanners, and two microphones, while the volunteers were seated in the driver's seat of the car. The data collection took place while the car was parked both indoors and outdoors, and different "noises" were added to simulate non-ideal biometric data capture that may be encountered in real-life driver recognition. Although the datasets are specifically tailored to in-vehicle biometric recognition, their utility is not limited to the automotive environment. The iCarB datasets, which are available to the research community, can be used to: (i) evaluate and benchmark face, fingerprint, and voice recognition systems (we provide several evaluation protocols); (ii) create multimodal pseudo-identities, to train/test multimodal fusion algorithms; (iii) create Presentation Attacks from the biometric data, to evaluate Presentation Attack Detection algorithms; (iv) investigate demographic and environmental biases in biometric systems, using the provided metadata. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the largest and most diverse publicly available in-vehicle biometric datasets. Most other datasets contain only one biometric modality (usually face), while our datasets consist of three modalities, all acquired in the same automotive environment. Moreover, iCarB-Fingerprint seems to be the first publicly available in-vehicle fingerprint dataset. Finally, the iCarB datasets boast a rare level of demographic diversity among the 200 data subjects, including a 50/50 gender split, skin colours across the whole Fitzpatrick-scale spectrum, and a wide age range (18-60+). So, these datasets will be valuable for advancing biometrics research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maorong Wang, Jiafeng Mao, Xueting Wang, Toshihiko Yamasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of denoising diffusion models has significantly advanced text-to-image generation. While these large-scale pretrained models show excellent performance in general image synthesis, downstream objectives often require fine-tuning to meet specific criteria such as aesthetics or human preference. Reward gradient-based strategies are promising in this context, yet existing methods are limited to single-reward tasks, restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios that demand adapting to multiple objectives introduced incrementally over time. In this paper, we first define this more realistic and unexplored problem, termed Reward Incremental Learning (RIL), where models are desired to adapt to multiple downstream objectives incrementally. Additionally, while the models adapt to the ever-emerging new objectives, we observe a unique form of catastrophic forgetting in diffusion model fine-tuning, affecting both metric-wise and visual structure-wise image quality. To address this catastrophic forgetting challenge, we propose Reward Incremental Distillation (RID), a method that mitigates forgetting with minimal computational overhead, enabling stable performance across sequential reward tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RID in achieving consistent, high-quality generation in RIL scenarios. The source code of our work will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Light-matter interactions modify both the intensity and polarization state of light. Changes in polarization, represented by a Mueller matrix, encode detailed scene information. Existing optical ellipsometers capture Mueller-matrix images; however, they are often limited to capturing static scenes due to long acquisition times. Here, we introduce Event Ellipsometer, a method for acquiring a Mueller-matrix video for dynamic scenes. Our imaging system employs fast-rotating quarter-wave plates (QWPs) in front of a light source and an event camera that asynchronously captures intensity changes induced by the rotating QWPs. We develop an ellipsometric-event image formation model, a calibration method, and an ellipsometric-event reconstruction method. We experimentally demonstrate that Event Ellipsometer enables Mueller-matrix video imaging at 30fps, extending ellipsometry to dynamic scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the task of instruction-based image editing. Previous works like InstructPix2Pix, InstructDiffusion, and SmartEdit have explored end-to-end editing. However, two limitations still remain: First, existing datasets suffer from low resolution, poor background consistency, and overly simplistic instructions. Second, current approaches mainly condition on the text while the rich image information is underexplored, therefore inferior in complex instruction following and maintaining background consistency. Targeting these issues, we first curated the AdvancedEdit dataset using a novel data construction pipeline, formulating a large-scale dataset with high visual quality, complex instructions, and good background consistency. Then, to further inject the rich image information, we introduce a two-stream bridging mechanism utilizing both the textual and visual features reasoned by the powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to guide the image editing process more precisely. Extensive results demonstrate that our approach, InsightEdit, achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling in complex instruction following and maintaining high background consistency with the original image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Ling, Bo Han, Shiyang Li, Hongdeng Shen, Jikang Cheng, Changqing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MotionLLaMA, a unified framework for motion synthesis and comprehension, along with a novel full-body motion tokenizer called the HoMi Tokenizer. MotionLLaMA is developed based on three core principles. First, it establishes a powerful unified representation space through the HoMi Tokenizer. Using a single codebook, the HoMi Tokenizer in MotionLLaMA achieves reconstruction accuracy comparable to residual vector quantization tokenizers utilizing six codebooks, outperforming all existing single-codebook tokenizers. Second, MotionLLaMA integrates a large language model to tackle various motion-related tasks. This integration bridges various modalities, facilitating both comprehensive and intricate motion synthesis and comprehension. Third, MotionLLaMA introduces the MotionHub dataset, currently the most extensive multimodal, multitask motion dataset, which enables fine-tuning of large language models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MotionLLaMA not only covers the widest range of motion-related tasks but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in motion completion, interaction dual-person text-to-motion, and all comprehension tasks while reaching performance comparable to SOTA in the remaining tasks. The code and MotionHub dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihui Zhang, Xiaoshuai Hao, Hanning Yuan, Lianhua Chi, Qi Guo, Qi Li, Ziqiang Yuan, Jinhui Pang, Yexin Li, Sijie Ruan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view contrastive clustering (MVCC) has gained significant attention for generating consistent clustering structures from multiple views through contrastive learning. However, most existing MVCC methods create cross-views by combining any two views, leading to a high volume of unreliable pairs. Furthermore, these approaches often overlook discrepancies in multi-view representations, resulting in representation degeneration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model called Dual-Weighted Contrastive Learning (DWCL) for Multi-View Clustering. Specifically, to reduce the impact of unreliable cross-views, we introduce an innovative Best-Other (B-O) contrastive mechanism that enhances the representation of individual views at a low computational cost. Furthermore, we develop a dual weighting strategy that combines a view quality weight, reflecting the quality of each view, with a view discrepancy weight. This approach effectively mitigates representation degeneration by downplaying cross-views that are both low in quality and high in discrepancy. We theoretically validate the efficiency of the B-O contrastive mechanism and the effectiveness of the dual weighting strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWCL outperforms previous methods across eight multi-view datasets, showcasing superior performance and robustness in MVCC. Specifically, our method achieves absolute accuracy improvements of 5.4\% and 5.6\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the Caltech6V7 and MSRCv1 datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Xu, Xiaokang Li, Chengyu Yue, Yuanyuan Wang, Yi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation often faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive annotation costs. While few-shot learning offers a promising solution to alleviate this burden, conventional approaches still rely heavily on pre-training with large volumes of labeled data from known categories. To address this issue, we propose leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on over 1 billion masks, thus circumventing the need for extensive domain-specific annotated data. In light of this, we developed SAM-MPA, an innovative SAM-based framework for few-shot medical image segmentation using Mask Propagation-based Auto-prompting. Initially, we employ k-centroid clustering to select the most representative examples for labelling to construct the support set. These annotated examples are registered to other images yielding deformation fields that facilitate the propagation of the mask knowledge to obtain coarse masks across the dataset. Subsequently, we automatically generate visual prompts based on the region and boundary expansion of the coarse mask, including points, box and a coarse mask. Finally, we can obtain the segmentation predictions by inputting these prompts into SAM and refine the results by post refinement module. We validate the performance of the proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on two medical image datasets with different modalities. Our method achieves Dices of 74.53%, 94.36% on Breast US, Chest X-ray, respectively. Experimental results substantiate that SAM-MPA yields high-accuracy segmentations within 10 labeled examples, outperforming other state-of-the-art few-shot auto-segmentation methods. Our method enables the customization of SAM for any medical image dataset with a small number of labeled examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Fujii, Hideo Saito, Ryo Hachiuma</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper jointly addresses three key limitations in conventional pedestrian trajectory forecasting: pedestrian perception errors, real-world data collection costs, and person ID annotation costs. We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Xu, Ziyao Huang, Juan Cao, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Qing Shuai, Yuchen Wang, Linchao Bao, Jintao Li, Fan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic generation of anchor-style product promotion videos presents promising opportunities in online commerce, advertising, and consumer engagement. However, this remains a challenging task despite significant advancements in pose-guided human video generation. In addressing this challenge, we identify the integration of human-object interactions (HOI) into pose-guided human video generation as a core issue. To this end, we introduce AnchorCrafter, a novel diffusion-based system designed to generate 2D videos featuring a target human and a customized object, achieving high visual fidelity and controllable interactions. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Additionally, we introduce the HOI-region reweighting loss, a training objective that enhances the learning of object details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms existing methods in preserving object appearance and shape awareness, while simultaneously maintaining consistency in human appearance and motion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duolikun Danier, Mehmet Ayg\"un, Changjian Li, Hakan Bilen, Oisin Mac Aodha</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained vision models are becoming increasingly prevalent, offering expressive and generalizable visual representations that benefit various downstream tasks. Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing continuous surfaces from unoriented and unordered 3D points is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recent advancements address this problem by training neural signed distance functions to pull 3D location queries to their closest points on a surface, following the predicted signed distances and the analytical gradients computed by the network. In this paper, we introduce NumGrad-Pull, leveraging the representation capability of tri-plane structures to accelerate the learning of signed distance functions and enhance the fidelity of local details in surface reconstruction. To further improve the training stability of grid-based tri-planes, we propose to exploit numerical gradients, replacing conventional analytical computations. Additionally, we present a progressive plane expansion strategy to facilitate faster signed distance function convergence and design a data sampling strategy to mitigate reconstruction artifacts. Our extensive experiments across a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CuiRuikai/NumGrad-Pull</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Wei, Zhongnian Li, Peng Ying, Xinzheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable capability in image classification. These VLMs leverage a predefined set of categories to construct text prompts for zero-shot reasoning. However, in more open-ended domains like autonomous driving, using a predefined set of labels becomes impractical, as the semantic label space is unknown and constantly evolving. Additionally, fixed embedding text prompts often tend to predict a single label (while in reality, multiple labels commonly exist per image). In this paper, we introduce CoA, an innovative Chain-of-Action (CoA) method that generates labels aligned with all contextually relevant features of an image. CoA is designed based on the observation that enriched and valuable contextual information improves generative performance during inference. Traditional vision-language models tend to output singular and redundant responses. Therefore, we employ a tailored CoA to alleviate this problem. We first break down the generative labeling task into detailed actions and construct an CoA leading to the final generative objective. Each action extracts and merges key information from the previous action and passes the enriched information as context to the next action, ultimately improving the VLM in generating comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We assess the effectiveness of CoA through comprehensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omnia Alwazzan, Amaya Gallagher-Syed, Thomas Millner, Ioannis Patras, Silvia Marino, Gregory Slabaugh</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing a central nervous system (CNS) tumor classifier by integrating DNA methylation data with Whole Slide Images (WSI) offers significant potential for enhancing diagnostic precision in neuropathology. Existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology only once - either at an early or late fusion stage - while reintroducing encoded omic data to create a dual fusion variant remains unexplored. Nevertheless, reintroduction of omic embeddings during early and late fusion enables the capture of complementary information from localized patch-level and holistic slide-level interactions, allowing boosted performance through advanced multimodal integration. To achieve this, we propose a dual fusion framework that integrates omic data at both early and late stages, fully leveraging its diagnostic strength. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected into a patch-wise latent space, generating omic-WSI embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights, effectively incorporating this information into the spatial representation of histology. These embeddings are refined with a multiple instance learning gated attention mechanism to attend to critical patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their global correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled high-quality 3D character reconstruction from multi-modal. However, animating these generated characters remains a challenging task, especially for complex elements like garments and hair, due to the lack of large-scale datasets and effective rigging methods. To address this gap, we curate AnimeRig, a large-scale dataset with detailed skeleton and skinning annotations. Building upon this, we propose DRiVE, a novel framework for generating and rigging 3D human characters with intricate structures. Unlike existing methods, DRiVE utilizes a 3D Gaussian representation, facilitating efficient animation and high-quality rendering. We further introduce GSDiff, a 3D Gaussian-based diffusion module that predicts joint positions as spatial distributions, overcoming the limitations of regression-based approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRiVE achieves precise rigging results, enabling realistic dynamics for clothing and hair, and surpassing previous methods in both quality and versatility. The code and dataset will be made public for academic use upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Xia, Randall Balestriero, Tao Zhang, Lorenz Hurni</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking geographic entities from historical maps, such as buildings, offers valuable insights into cultural heritage, urbanization patterns, environmental changes, and various historical research endeavors. However, linking these entities across diverse maps remains a persistent challenge for researchers. Traditionally, this has been addressed through a two-step process: detecting entities within individual maps and then associating them via a heuristic-based post-processing step. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines segmentation and association of geographic entities in historical maps using video instance segmentation (VIS). This method significantly streamlines geographic entity alignment and enhances automation. However, acquiring high-quality, video-format training data for VIS models is prohibitively expensive, especially for historical maps that often contain hundreds or thousands of geographic entities. To mitigate this challenge, we explore self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to enhance VIS performance on historical maps. We evaluate the performance of VIS models under different pretraining configurations and introduce a novel method for generating synthetic videos from unlabeled historical map images for pretraining. Our proposed self-supervised VIS method substantially reduces the need for manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed self-supervised VIS approach, achieving a 24.9\% improvement in AP and a 0.23 increase in F1 score compared to the model trained from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghai Yuan, Jinfa Huang, Xianyi He, Yunyuan Ge, Yujun Shi, Liuhan Chen, Jiebo Luo, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity. It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language generative reward models (VL-GenRMs) play a crucial role in aligning and evaluating multimodal AI systems, yet their own evaluation remains under-explored. Current assessment methods primarily rely on AI-annotated preference labels from traditional VL tasks, which can introduce biases and often fail to effectively challenge state-of-the-art models. To address these limitations, we introduce VL-RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning general multimodal queries, visual hallucination detection, and complex reasoning tasks. Through our AI-assisted annotation pipeline combining sample selection with human verification, we curate 1,250 high-quality examples specifically designed to probe model limitations. Comprehensive evaluation across 16 leading large vision-language models, demonstrates VL-RewardBench's effectiveness as a challenging testbed, where even GPT-4o achieves only 65.4% accuracy, and state-of-the-art open-source models such as Qwen2-VL-72B, struggle to surpass random-guessing. Importantly, performance on VL-RewardBench strongly correlates (Pearson's r > 0.9) with MMMU-Pro accuracy using Best-of-N sampling with VL-GenRMs. Analysis experiments uncover three critical insights for improving VL-GenRMs: (i) models predominantly fail at basic visual perception tasks rather than reasoning tasks; (ii) inference-time scaling benefits vary dramatically by model capacity; and (iii) training VL-GenRMs to learn to judge substantially boosts judgment capability (+14.7% accuracy for a 7B VL-GenRM). We believe VL-RewardBench along with the experimental insights will become a valuable resource for advancing VL-GenRMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyou Xie, Jiayi Kuang, Zhenzhou Lin, Jiarui Ouyang, Zishuo Zhao, Ying Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a query from one modality, few-shot cross-modal retrieval (CMR) retrieves semantically similar instances in another modality with the target domain including classes that are disjoint from the source domain. Compared with classical few-shot CMR methods, vision-language pretraining methods like CLIP have shown great few-shot or zero-shot learning performance. However, they still suffer challenges due to (1) the feature degradation encountered in the target domain and (2) the extreme data imbalance. To tackle these issues, we propose FLEX-CLIP, a novel Feature-level Generation Network Enhanced CLIP. FLEX-CLIP includes two training stages. In multimodal feature generation, we propose a composite multimodal VAE-GAN network to capture real feature distribution patterns and generate pseudo samples based on CLIP features, addressing data imbalance. For common space projection, we develop a gate residual network to fuse CLIP features with projected features, reducing feature degradation in X-shot scenarios. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show a 7%-15% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies demonstrating enhancement of CLIP features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Qinghong Lin, Linjie Li, Difei Gao, Zhengyuan Yang, Shiwei Wu, Zechen Bai, Weixian Lei, Lijuan Wang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) assistants holds significant promise for enhancing human workflow productivity. While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. In this work, we develop a vision-language-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale High-quality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4x. Navigation experiments across web Mind2Web, mobile AITW, and online MiniWob environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of our model in advancing GUI visual agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuweiyi Chen, Zezhou Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for acquiring transferable 3D representations from unlabeled 3D point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations.
  Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from this synthesized dataset perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. Our analysis further suggests that current self-supervised learning methods primarily capture geometric structures rather than high-level semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Nourilenjan Nokabadi, Jean-Francois Lalonde, Christian Gagn\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial perturbations aim to deceive neural networks into predicting inaccurate results. For visual object trackers, adversarial attacks have been developed to generate perturbations by manipulating the outputs. However, transformer trackers predict a specific bounding box instead of an object candidate list, which limits the applicability of many existing attack scenarios. To address this issue, we present a novel white-box approach to attack visual object trackers with transformer backbones using only one bounding box. From the tracker predicted bounding box, we generate a list of adversarial bounding boxes and compute the adversarial loss for those bounding boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that our simple yet effective attack outperforms existing attacks against several robust transformer trackers, including TransT-M, ROMTrack, and MixFormer, on popular benchmark tracking datasets such as GOT-10k, UAV123, and VOT2022STS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving optimal performance of video diffusion transformers within given data and compute budget is crucial due to their high training costs. This necessitates precisely determining the optimal model size and training hyperparameters before large-scale training. While scaling laws are employed in language models to predict performance, their existence and accurate derivation in visual generation models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically analyze scaling laws for video diffusion transformers and confirm their presence. Moreover, we discover that, unlike language models, video diffusion models are more sensitive to learning rate and batch size, two hyperparameters often not precisely modeled. To address this, we propose a new scaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and compute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance and reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods, within a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more generalized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and compute budget. This enables performance prediction for non-optimal model sizes, which may also be appealed under practical inference cost constraints, achieving a better trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Hanchen Jiang, Yasi Zhang, Zhi Zhang, Yixin Wan, Andrew Lizarraga, Shufan Li, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling by producing high-fidelity, diverse, and visually realistic images from textual prompts. Despite these advances, existing models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and attributes, often misaligning modifiers with their corresponding nouns or neglecting certain elements. Recent attention-based methods have improved object inclusion and linguistic binding, but still face challenges such as attribute misbinding and a lack of robust generalization guarantees. Leveraging the PAC-Bayes framework, we propose a Bayesian approach that designs custom priors over attention distributions to enforce desirable properties, including divergence between objects, alignment between modifiers and their corresponding nouns, minimal attention to irrelevant tokens, and regularization for better generalization. Our approach treats the attention mechanism as an interpretable component, enabling fine-grained control and improved attribute-object alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on standard benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. By integrating custom priors into the denoising process, our method enhances image quality and addresses long-standing challenges in T2I diffusion models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Ma, Zhenliang Ni, Xinghao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba has shown great potential for computer vision due to its linear complexity in modeling the global context with respect to the input length. However, existing lightweight Mamba-based backbones cannot demonstrate performance that matches Convolution or Transformer-based methods. We observe that simply modifying the scanning path in the image domain is not conducive to fully exploiting the potential of vision Mamba. In this paper, we first perform comprehensive spectral and quantitative analyses, and verify that the Mamba block mainly models low-frequency information under Convolution-Mamba hybrid architecture. Based on the analyses, we introduce a novel Laplace mixer to decouple the features in terms of frequency and input only the low-frequency components into the Mamba block. In addition, considering the redundancy of the features and the different requirements for high-frequency details and low-frequency global information at different stages, we introduce a frequency ramp inception, i.e., gradually reduce the input dimensions of the high-frequency branches, so as to efficiently trade-off the high-frequency and low-frequency components at different layers. By integrating mobile-friendly convolution and efficient Laplace mixer, we build a series of tiny hybrid vision Mamba called TinyViM. The proposed TinyViM achieves impressive performance on several downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. In particular, TinyViM outperforms Convolution, Transformer and Mamba-based models with similar scales, and the throughput is about 2-3 times higher than that of other Mamba-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuweiyi Chen, Markus Marks, Zezhou Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Mid-level vision capabilities - such as generic object localization and 3D geometric understanding - are not only fundamental to human vision but are also crucial for many real-world applications of computer vision. These abilities emerge with minimal supervision during the early stages of human visual development. Despite their significance, current self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches are primarily designed and evaluated for high-level recognition tasks, leaving their mid-level vision capabilities largely unexamined.
  In this study, we introduce a suite of benchmark protocols to systematically assess mid-level vision capabilities and present a comprehensive, controlled evaluation of 22 prominent SSL models across 8 mid-level vision tasks. Our experiments reveal a weak correlation between mid-level and high-level task performance. We also identify several SSL methods with highly imbalanced performance across mid-level and high-level capabilities, as well as some that excel in both. Additionally, we investigate key factors contributing to mid-level vision performance, such as pretraining objectives and network architectures. Our study provides a holistic and timely view of what SSL models have learned, complementing existing research that primarily focuses on high-level vision tasks. We hope our findings guide future SSL research to benchmark models not only on high-level vision tasks but on mid-level as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-Bac Nguyen, Arabinda Kumar Choudhary, Pawan Sinha, Xin Li, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) aims to extract visual information perceived by humans from brain activity recorded through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Despite notable advancements in recent years, existing studies in VBU continue to face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose knowledge from prior subjects as they adapt to new ones. Addressing continual learning in this field is, therefore, essential. This paper introduces a novel framework called Continual Learning for Vision-Brain (COBRA) to address continual learning in VBU. Our approach includes three novel modules: a Subject Commonality (SC) module, a Prompt-based Subject Specific (PSS) module, and a transformer-based module for fMRI, denoted as MRIFormer module. The SC module captures shared vision-brain patterns across subjects, preserving this knowledge as the model encounters new subjects, thereby reducing the impact of catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, the PSS module learns unique vision-brain patterns specific to each subject. Finally, the MRIFormer module contains a transformer encoder and decoder that learns the fMRI features for VBU from common and specific patterns. In a continual learning setup, COBRA is trained in new PSS and MRIFormer modules for new subjects, leaving the modules of previous subjects unaffected. As a result, COBRA effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both continual learning and vision-brain reconstruction tasks, surpassing previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhao Wang, Huafeng Li, Yafei Zhang, Jinxing Li, Minghong Xie, Dapeng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Paragraph Grounding (VPG) aims to precisely locate the most appropriate moments within a video that are relevant to a given textual paragraph query. However, existing methods typically rely on large-scale annotated temporal labels and assume that the correspondence between videos and paragraphs is known. This is impractical in real-world applications, as constructing temporal labels requires significant labor costs, and the correspondence is often unknown. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-task Mutual Reinforcing Embedded Joint Video Paragraph Retrieval and Grounding method (DMR-JRG). In this method, retrieval and grounding tasks are mutually reinforced rather than being treated as separate issues. DMR-JRG mainly consists of two branches: a retrieval branch and a grounding branch. The retrieval branch uses inter-video contrastive learning to roughly align the global features of paragraphs and videos, reducing modality differences and constructing a coarse-grained feature space to break free from the need for correspondence between paragraphs and videos. Additionally, this coarse-grained feature space further facilitates the grounding branch in extracting fine-grained contextual representations. In the grounding branch, we achieve precise cross-modal matching and grounding by exploring the consistency between local, global, and temporal dimensions of video segments and textual paragraphs. By synergizing these dimensions, we construct a fine-grained feature space for video and textual features, greatly reducing the need for large-scale annotated temporal labels.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489">Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided No-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolai Hermann, Jorge Condor, Piotr Didyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Wang, Sameera Ramasinghe, Chenchen Xu, Julien Monteil, Loris Bazzani, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan</p>
<p>Abstract: Structuring latent representations in a hierarchical manner enables models to learn patterns at multiple levels of abstraction. However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omri Kaduri, Shai Bagon, Tali Dekel</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending complex visual content. However, the mechanisms underlying how VLMs process visual information remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis, focusing on attention modules across layers. We reveal several key insights about how these models process visual data: (i) the internal representation of the query tokens (e.g., representations of "describe the image"), is utilized by VLMs to store global image information; we demonstrate that these models generate surprisingly descriptive responses solely from these tokens, without direct access to image tokens. (ii) Cross-modal information flow is predominantly influenced by the middle layers (approximately 25% of all layers), while early and late layers contribute only marginally.(iii) Fine-grained visual attributes and object details are directly extracted from image tokens in a spatially localized manner, i.e., the generated tokens associated with a specific object or attribute attend strongly to their corresponding regions in the image. We propose novel quantitative evaluation to validate our observations, leveraging real-world complex visual scenes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our findings in facilitating efficient visual processing in state-of-the-art VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Volodymyr Karpenko, Taimoor Tariq, Jorge Condor, Piotr Didyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep-learning based super-resolution techniques process images and videos independently of the underlying content and viewing conditions. However, the sensitivity of the human visual system to image details changes depending on the underlying content characteristics, such as spatial frequency, luminance, color, contrast, or motion. This observation hints that computational resources spent on up-sampling visual content may be wasted whenever a viewer cannot resolve the results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a perceptually inspired and architecture-agnostic approach for controlling the visual quality and efficiency of super-resolution techniques. The core is a perceptual model that dynamically guides super-resolution methods according to the human's sensitivity to image details. Our technique leverages the limitations of the human visual system to improve the efficiency of super-resolution techniques by focusing computational resources on perceptually important regions; judged on the basis of factors such as adapting luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, motion, and viewing conditions. We demonstrate the application of our proposed model in combination with network branching, and network complexity reduction to improve the computational efficiency of super-resolution methods without visible quality loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing FLOPS by factors of 2$\mathbf{x}$ and greater, without sacrificing perceived quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decomposing physically-based materials from images into their constituent properties remains challenging, particularly when maintaining both computational efficiency and physical consistency. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown promise, they face substantial computational overhead due to multiple denoising steps and separate models for different material properties. We present SuperMat, a single-step framework that achieves high-quality material decomposition with one-step inference. This enables end-to-end training with perceptual and re-render losses while decomposing albedo, metallic, and roughness maps at millisecond-scale speeds. We further extend our framework to 3D objects through a UV refinement network, enabling consistent material estimation across viewpoints while maintaining efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SuperMat achieves state-of-the-art PBR material decomposition quality while reducing inference time from seconds to milliseconds per image, and completes PBR material estimation for 3D objects in approximately 3 seconds.

<p>Abstract: We present the updated version of the HSI-Drive dataset aimed at developing automated driving systems (ADS) using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). The v2.0 version includes new annotated images from videos recorded during winter and fall in real driving scenarios. Added to the spring and summer images included in the previous v1.1 version, the new dataset contains 752 images covering the four seasons. In this paper, we show the improvements achieved over previously published results obtained on the v1.1 dataset, showcasing the enhanced performance of models trained on the new v2.0 dataset. We also show the progress made in comprehensive scene understanding by experimenting with more capable image segmentation models. These models include new segmentation categories aimed at the identification of essential road safety objects such as the presence of vehicles and road signs, as well as highly vulnerable groups like pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, we provide evidence of the performance and robustness of the models when applied to segmenting HSI video sequences captured in various environments and conditions. Finally, for a correct assessment of the results described in this work, the constraints imposed by the processing platforms that can sensibly be deployed in vehicles for ADS must be taken into account. Thus, and although implementation details are out of the scope of this paper, we focus our research on the development of computationally efficient, lightweight ML models that can eventually operate at high throughput rates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengjian Li, Xiangbo Shu, Qiongjie Cui, Yazhou Yao, Jinhui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models achieve impressive performance in human motion generation. However, current approaches typically ignore the significance of frequency-domain information in capturing fine-grained motions within the latent space (e.g., low frequencies correlate with static poses, and high frequencies align with fine-grained motions). Additionally, there is a semantic discrepancy between text and motion, leading to inconsistency between the generated motions and the text descriptions. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based FTMoMamba framework equipped with a Frequency State Space Model (FreqSSM) and a Text State Space Model (TextSSM). Specifically, to learn fine-grained representation, FreqSSM decomposes sequences into low-frequency and high-frequency components, guiding the generation of static pose (e.g., sits, lay) and fine-grained motions (e.g., transition, stumble), respectively. To ensure the consistency between text and motion, TextSSM encodes text features at the sentence level, aligning textual semantics with sequential features. Extensive experiments show that FTMoMamba achieves superior performance on the text-to-motion generation task, especially gaining the lowest FID of 0.181 (rather lower than 0.421 of MLD) on the HumanML3D dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Shandilya, Swapnil Bhat, Akshat Gautam, Subhash Yadav, Siddharth Bhatt, Deval Mehta, Kshitij Jadhav</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have proven to be very effective in generating synthetic medical images and find applications in downstream tasks such as enhancing rare disease datasets, long-tailed dataset augmentation, and scaling machine learning algorithms. For medical applications, the synthetically generated medical images by such models are still reasonable in quality when evaluated based on traditional metrics such as FID score, precision, and recall. However, these metrics fail to capture the medical/biological plausibility of the generated images. Human expert feedback has been used to get biological plausibility which demonstrates that these generated images have very low plausibility. Recently, the research community has further integrated this human feedback through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF), which generates more medically plausible images. However, incorporating human feedback is a costly and slow process. In this work, we propose a novel approach to improve the medical plausibility of generated images without the need for human feedback. We introduce IMPROVE:Improving Medical Plausibility without Reliance on Human Validation - An Enhanced Prototype-Guided Diffusion Framework, a prototype-guided diffusion process for medical image generation and show that it substantially enhances the biological plausibility of the generated medical images without the need for any human feedback. We perform experiments on Bone Marrow and HAM10000 datasets and show that medical accuracy can be substantially increased without human feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object detection and semantic segmentation are both scene understanding tasks yet they differ in data structure and information level. Object detection requires box coordinates for object instances while semantic segmentation requires pixel-wise class labels. Making use of one task's information to train the other would be beneficial for multi-task partially supervised learning where each training example is annotated only for a single task, having the potential to expand training sets with different-task datasets. This paper studies various weak losses for partially annotated data in combination with existing supervised losses. We propose Box-for-Mask and Mask-for-Box strategies, and their combination BoMBo, to distil necessary information from one task annotations to train the other. Ablation studies and experimental results on VOC and COCO datasets show favorable results for the proposed idea. Source code and data splits can be found at https://github.com/lhoangan/multas.</p>

<p>Abstract: The article discusses the use of low cost System-On-Module (SOM) platforms for the implementation of efficient hyperspectral imaging (HSI) processors for application in autonomous driving. The work addresses the challenges of shaping and deploying multiple layer fully convolutional networks (FCN) for low-latency, on-board image semantic segmentation using resource- and power-constrained processing devices. The paper describes in detail the steps followed to redesign and customize a successfully trained HSI segmentation lightweight FCN that was previously tested on a high-end heterogeneous multiprocessing system-on-chip (MPSoC) to accommodate it to the constraints imposed by a low-cost SOM. This SOM features a lower-end but much cheaper MPSoC suitable for the deployment of automatic driving systems (ADS). In particular the article reports the data- and hardware-specific quantization techniques utilized to fit the FCN into a commercial fixed-point programmable AI coprocessor IP, and proposes a full customized post-training quantization scheme to reduce computation and storage costs without compromising segmentation accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17557">A Bilayer Segmentation-Recombination Network for Accurate Segmentation of Overlapping C. elegans</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengqian Dinga, Jun Liua, Yang Luo, Jinshan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is an excellent model organism because of its short lifespan and high degree of homology with human genes, and it has been widely used in a variety of human health and disease models. However, the segmentation of C. elegans remains challenging due to the following reasons: 1) the activity trajectory of C. elegans is uncontrollable, and multiple nematodes often overlap, resulting in blurred boundaries of C. elegans. This makes it impossible to clearly study the life trajectory of a certain nematode; and 2) in the microscope images of overlapping C. elegans, the translucent tissues at the edges obscure each other, leading to inaccurate boundary segmentation. To solve these problems, a Bilayer Segmentation-Recombination Network (BR-Net) for the segmentation of C. elegans instances is proposed. The network consists of three parts: A Coarse Mask Segmentation Module (CMSM), a Bilayer Segmentation Module (BSM), and a Semantic Consistency Recombination Module (SCRM). The CMSM is used to extract the coarse mask, and we introduce a Unified Attention Module (UAM) in CMSM to make CMSM better aware of nematode instances. The Bilayer Segmentation Module (BSM) segments the aggregated C. elegans into overlapping and non-overlapping regions. This is followed by integration by the SCRM, where semantic consistency regularization is introduced to segment nematode instances more accurately. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified on the C. elegans dataset. The experimental results show that BR-Net exhibits good competitiveness and outperforms other recently proposed instance segmentation methods in processing C. elegans occlusion images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jovana Videnovic, Alan Lukezic, Matej Kristan</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory-based trackers are video object segmentation methods that form the target model by concatenating recently tracked frames into a memory buffer and localize the target by attending the current image to the buffered frames. While already achieving top performance on many benchmarks, it was the recent release of SAM2 that placed memory-based trackers into focus of the visual object tracking community. Nevertheless, modern trackers still struggle in the presence of distractors. We argue that a more sophisticated memory model is required, and propose a new distractor-aware memory model for SAM2 and an introspection-based update strategy that jointly addresses the segmentation accuracy as well as tracking robustness. The resulting tracker is denoted as SAM2.1++. We also propose a new distractor-distilled DiDi dataset to study the distractor problem better. SAM2.1++ outperforms SAM2.1 and related SAM memory extensions on seven benchmarks and sets a solid new state-of-the-art on six of them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stuti Pathak, Prashant Kumar, Nicholus Mboga, Gunther Steenackers, Rudi Penne</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds acquired in constrained and challenging real-world settings are incomplete, non-uniformly sparse, or both. These obstacles present acute challenges for a vital task - point cloud completion. Using tools from Algebraic Topology and Persistent Homology ($\mathcal{PH}$), we demonstrate that current benchmark synthetic point clouds lack rich topological features that are important constituents of point clouds captured in realistic settings. To facilitate research in this direction, we contribute the first real-world industrial point cloud dataset for point cloud completion, RealPC - a diverse set of rich and varied point clouds, consisting of $\sim$ 40,000 pairs across 21 categories of industrial structures in railway establishments. Our benchmark results on several strong baselines reveal a striking observation - the existing methods are tailored for synthetic datasets and fail miserably in real-world settings. Building on our observation that RealPC consists of several 0 and 1-dimensional $\mathcal{PH}$-based topological features, we demonstrate the potential of integrating Homology-based topological priors into existing works. More specifically, we present how 0-dimensional $\mathcal{PH}$ priors, which extract the global topology of a complete shape in the form of a 3-D skeleton, can assist a model in generating topologically-consistent complete shapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davyd Svyezhentsev, George Retsinas, Petros Maragos</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, interest in synthetic data has grown, particularly in the context of pre-training the image modality to support a range of computer vision tasks, including object classification, medical imaging etc. Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic samples, automatically produced by various generative processes, can replace real counterparts and yield strong visual representations. This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy.
  We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition. Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures. To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training. Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos. The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes. Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Wang, Longguang Wang, Zhiyuan Ma, Qibin Hu, Kai Xu, Yulan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the typical inversion-then-editing paradigm using text-to-image (T2I) models has demonstrated promising results, directly extending it to text-to-video (T2V) models still suffers severe artifacts such as color flickering and content distortion. Consequently, current video editing methods primarily rely on T2I models, which inherently lack temporal-coherence generative ability, often resulting in inferior editing results. In this paper, we attribute the failure of the typical editing paradigm to: 1) Tightly Spatial-temporal Coupling. The vanilla pivotal-based inversion strategy struggles to disentangle spatial-temporal information in the video diffusion model; 2) Complicated Spatial-temporal Layout. The vanilla cross-attention control is deficient in preserving the unedited content. To address these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled guidance (STDG) and multi-frame null-text optimization strategy to provide pivotal temporal cues for more precise pivotal inversion. Furthermore, we introduce a self-attention control strategy to maintain higher fidelity for precise partial content editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method (termed VideoDirector) effectively harnesses the powerful temporal generation capabilities of T2V models, producing edited videos with state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, motion smoothness, realism, and fidelity to unedited content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqi Bao, Jing Liao, Jing Huo, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present DGGS, a novel framework addressing the previously unexplored challenge of Distractor-free Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). It accomplishes two key objectives: fortifying generalizable 3DGS against distractor-laden data during both training and inference phases, while successfully extending cross-scene adaptation capabilities to conventional distractor-free approaches. To achieve these objectives, DGGS introduces a scene-agnostic reference-based mask prediction and refinement methodology during training phase, coupled with a training view selection strategy, effectively improving distractor prediction accuracy and training stability. Moreover, to address distractor-induced voids and artifacts during inference stage, we propose a two-stage inference framework for better reference selection based on the predicted distractor masks, complemented by a distractor pruning module to eliminate residual distractor effects. Extensive generalization experiments demonstrate DGGS's advantages under distractor-laden conditions. Additionally, experimental results show that our scene-agnostic mask inference achieves accuracy comparable to scene-specific trained methods. Homepage is \url{https://github.com/bbbbby-99/DGGS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wei, Yujie Zhong, Haoxian Tan, Yong Liu, Zheng Zhao, Jie Hu, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to address universal segmentation for image and video perception with the strong reasoning ability empowered by Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs). Despite significant progress in current unified segmentation methods, limitations in adaptation to both image and video scenarios, as well as the complex reasoning segmentation, make it difficult for them to handle various challenging instructions and achieve an accurate understanding of fine-grained vision-language correlations. We propose HyperSeg, the first VLLM-based universal segmentation model for pixel-level image and video perception, encompassing generic segmentation tasks and more complex reasoning perception tasks requiring powerful reasoning abilities and world knowledge. Besides, to fully leverage the recognition capabilities of VLLMs and the fine-grained visual information, HyperSeg incorporates hybrid entity recognition and fine-grained visual perceiver modules for various segmentation tasks. Combined with the temporal adapter, HyperSeg achieves a comprehensive understanding of temporal information. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our insights in resolving universal image and video segmentation tasks, including the more complex reasoning perception tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niharika Hegde, Shishir Muralidhara, Ren\'e Schuster, Didier Stricker</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, environment perception has significantly advanced with the utilization of deep learning techniques for diverse sensors such as cameras, depth sensors, or infrared sensors. The diversity in the sensor stack increases the safety and contributes to robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. However, the variance in data acquired from different sensors poses challenges. In the context of continual learning (CL), incremental learning is especially challenging for considerably large domain shifts, e.g. different sensor modalities. This amplifies the problem of catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we formulate the concept of modality-incremental learning and examine its necessity, by contrasting it with existing incremental learning paradigms. We propose the use of a modified Relevance Mapping Network (RMN) to incrementally learn new modalities while preserving performance on previously learned modalities, in which relevance maps are disjoint. Experimental results demonstrate that the prevention of shared connections in this approach helps alleviate the problem of forgetting within the constraints of a strict continual learning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Cheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17646">SAMWISE: Infusing wisdom in SAM2 for Text-Driven Video Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudia Cuttano, Gabriele Trivigno, Gabriele Rosi, Carlo Masone, Giuseppe Averta</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) relies on natural language expressions to segment an object in a video clip. Existing methods restrict reasoning either to independent short clips, losing global context, or process the entire video offline, impairing their application in a streaming fashion. In this work, we aim to surpass these limitations and design an RVOS method capable of effectively operating in streaming-like scenarios while retaining contextual information from past frames. We build upon the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM2) model, that provides robust segmentation and tracking capabilities and is naturally suited for streaming processing. We make SAM2 wiser, by empowering it with natural language understanding and explicit temporal modeling at the feature extraction stage, without fine-tuning its weights, and without outsourcing modality interaction to external models. To this end, we introduce a novel adapter module that injects temporal information and multi-modal cues in the feature extraction process. We further reveal the phenomenon of tracking bias in SAM2 and propose a learnable module to adjust its tracking focus when the current frame features suggest a new object more aligned with the caption. Our proposed method, SAMWISE, achieves state-of-the-art across various benchmarks, by adding a negligible overhead of just 4.2 M parameters.

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in scene synthesis makes standalone SLAM systems purely based on optimizing hyperprimitives with a Rendering objective possible \cite{monogs}.
  However, the tracking performance still lacks behind traditional \cite{orbslam} and end-to-end SLAM systems \cite{droid}.
  An optimal trade-off between robustness, speed and accuracy has not yet been reached, especially for monocular video.
  In this paper, we introduce a SLAM system based on an end-to-end Tracker and extend it with a Renderer based on recent 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques.
  Our framework \textbf{DroidSplat} achieves both SotA tracking and rendering results on common SLAM benchmarks.
  We implemented multiple building blocks of modern SLAM systems to run in parallel, allowing for fast inference on common consumer GPU's.
  Recent progress in monocular depth prediction and camera calibration allows our system to achieve strong results even on in-the-wild data without known camera intrinsics.

<p>Abstract: Sketching serves as a versatile tool for externalizing ideas, enabling rapid exploration and visual communication that spans various disciplines. While artificial systems have driven substantial advances in content creation and human-computer interaction, capturing the dynamic and abstract nature of human sketching remains challenging. In this work, we introduce SketchAgent, a language-driven, sequential sketch generation method that enables users to create, modify, and refine sketches through dynamic, conversational interactions. Our approach requires no training or fine-tuning. Instead, we leverage the sequential nature and rich prior knowledge of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs). We present an intuitive sketching language, introduced to the model through in-context examples, enabling it to "draw" using string-based actions. These are processed into vector graphics and then rendered to create a sketch on a pixel canvas, which can be accessed again for further tasks. By drawing stroke by stroke, our agent captures the evolving, dynamic qualities intrinsic to sketching. We demonstrate that SketchAgent can generate sketches from diverse prompts, engage in dialogue-driven drawing, and collaborate meaningfully with human users.</p>

<p>Abstract: To accelerate the inference of heavy Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this study rethinks the current landscape of training-free token reduction research. We regret to find that the critical components of existing methods are tightly intertwined, with their interconnections and effects remaining unclear for comparison, transfer, and expansion. Therefore, we propose a unified ''filter-correlate-compress'' paradigm that decomposes the token reduction into three distinct stages within a pipeline, maintaining consistent design objectives and elements while allowing for unique implementations. We additionally demystify the popular works and subsume them into our paradigm to showcase its universality. Finally, we offer a suite of methods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy throughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10 benchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in FLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art training-free methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudarshan Rajagopalan, Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair, Jay N. Paranjape, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based models for All-In-One Image Restoration (AIOR) have achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image-based relighting of indoor rooms creates an immersive virtual understanding of the space, which is useful for interior design, virtual staging, and real estate. Relighting indoor rooms from a single image is especially challenging due to complex illumination interactions between multiple lights and cluttered objects featuring a large variety in geometrical and material complexity. Recently, generative models have been successfully applied to image-based relighting conditioned on a target image or a latent code, albeit without detailed local lighting control. In this paper, we introduce ScribbleLight, a generative model that supports local fine-grained control of lighting effects through scribbles that describe changes in lighting. Our key technical novelty is an Albedo-conditioned Stable Image Diffusion model that preserves the intrinsic color and texture of the original image after relighting and an encoder-decoder-based ControlNet architecture that enables geometry-preserving lighting effects with normal map and scribble annotations. We demonstrate ScribbleLight's ability to create different lighting effects (e.g., turning lights on/off, adding highlights, cast shadows, or indirect lighting from unseen lights) from sparse scribble annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyuan Tu, Zhen Xing, Xintong Han, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Zuxuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents StableAnimator, the first end-to-end ID-preserving video diffusion framework, which synthesizes high-quality videos without any post-processing, conditioned on a reference image and a sequence of poses. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator begins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors, respectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image embeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder. Then, StableAnimator introduces a novel distribution-aware ID Adapter that prevents interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via alignment. During inference, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimization to further enhance the face quality. We demonstrate that solving the HJB equation can be integrated into the diffusion denoising process, and the resulting solution constrains the denoising path and thus benefits ID preservation. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

<p>Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge, we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). \textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception, \textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linyi Huang, Hui Zhang, Zijian Wu, Sammy Christen, Jie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional grasping is essential for humans to perform specific tasks, such as grasping scissors by the finger holes to cut materials or by the blade to safely hand them over. Enabling dexterous robot hands with functional grasping capabilities is crucial for their deployment to accomplish diverse real-world tasks. Recent research in dexterous grasping, however, often focuses on power grasps while overlooking task- and object-specific functional grasping poses. In this paper, we introduce FunGrasp, a system that enables functional dexterous grasping across various robot hands and performs one-shot transfer to unseen objects. Given a single RGBD image of functional human grasping, our system estimates the hand pose and transfers it to different robotic hands via a human-to-robot (H2R) grasp retargeting module. Guided by the retargeted grasping poses, a policy is trained through reinforcement learning in simulation for dynamic grasping control. To achieve robust sim-to-real transfer, we employ several techniques including privileged learning, system identification, domain randomization, and gravity compensation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our system enables diverse functional grasping of unseen objects using single RGBD images, and can be successfully deployed across various dexterous robot hands. The significance of the components is validated through comprehensive ablation studies. Project page: https://hly-123.github.io/FunGrasp/ .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shester Gueuwou, Xiaodan Du, Greg Shakhnarovich, Karen Livescu, Alexander H. Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language processing has traditionally relied on task-specific models,limiting the potential for transfer learning across tasks. We introduce SHuBERT (Sign Hidden-Unit BERT), a self-supervised transformer encoder that learns strong representations from approximately 1,000 hours of American Sign Language (ASL) video content. Inspired by the success of the HuBERT speech representation model, SHuBERT adapts masked prediction for multi-stream visual sign language input, learning to predict multiple targets for corresponding to clustered hand, face, and body pose streams. SHuBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. On sign language translation, it outperforms prior methods trained on publicly available data on the How2Sign (+0.7 BLEU), OpenASL (+10.0 BLEU), and FLEURS-ASL (+0.3 BLEU) benchmarks. Similarly for isolated sign language recognition, SHuBERT's accuracy surpasses that of specialized models on ASL-Citizen (+5\%) and SEM-LEX (+20.6\%), while coming close to them on WLASL2000 (-3\%). Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi-Yi Chin, Kuan-Chen Mu, Mario Fritz, Pin-Yu Chen, Wei-Chen Chiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have shown remarkable progress, but their potential to generate harmful content remains a critical concern in the ML community. While various safety mechanisms have been developed, the field lacks systematic tools for evaluating their effectiveness against real-world misuse scenarios. In this work, we propose ICER, a novel red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and a bandit optimization-based algorithm to generate interpretable and semantic meaningful problematic prompts by learning from past successful red-teaming attempts. Our ICER efficiently probes safety mechanisms across different T2I models without requiring internal access or additional training, making it broadly applicable to deployed systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICER significantly outperforms existing prompt attack methods in identifying model vulnerabilities while maintaining high semantic similarity with intended content. By uncovering that successful jailbreaking instances can systematically facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, our work provides crucial insights for developing more robust safety mechanisms in T2I systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuan Liu, Huanran Chen, Yichi Zhang, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: A longstanding problem of deep learning models is their vulnerability to adversarial examples, which are often generated by applying imperceptible perturbations to natural examples. Adversarial examples exhibit cross-model transferability, enabling to attack black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability by attacking multiple surrogate models simultaneously. However, as prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the findings in large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. By analyzing the relationship between the number of surrogate models and transferability of adversarial examples, we conclude with clear scaling laws, emphasizing the potential of using more surrogate models to enhance adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, multimodal large language models, and even proprietary models like GPT-4o, demonstrating consistent scaling effects and impressive attack success rates with more surrogate models. Further studies by visualization indicate that scaled attacks bring better interpretability in semantics, indicating that the common features of models are captured.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar El Assal (VIBOT, ImViA, Alstom Transport), Carlos M. Mateo (ICB), Sebastien Ciron (Alstom Transport), David Fofi (VIBOT, ImViA)</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the difficulties imposed on the manipulation of deformable objects is their characterization and the detection of representative keypoints for the purpose of manipulation. A keen interest was manifested by researchers in the last decade to characterize and manipulate deformable objects of non-fluid nature, such as clothes and ropes. Even though several propositions were made in the regard of object characterization, however researchers were always confronted with the need of pixel-level information of the object through images to extract relevant information. This usually is accomplished by means of segmentation networks trained on manually labeled data for this purpose. In this paper, we address the subject of characterizing weld pool to define stable features that serve as information for further motion control objectives. We achieve this by employing different pipelines. The first one consists of characterizing fluid deformable objects through the use of a generative model that is trained using a teacher-student framework. And in the second one we leverage foundation models by using them as teachers to characterize the object in the image, without the need of any pre-training and any dataset. The performance of knowledge distillation from foundation models into a smaller generative model shows prominent results in the characterization of deformable objects. The student network was capable of learning to retrieve the keypoitns of the object with an error of 13.4 pixels. And the teacher was evaluated based on its capacities to retrieve pixel level information represented by the object mask, with a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 75.26%.</p>

<p>Abstract: As global life expectancy increases, so does the burden of chronic diseases, yet individuals exhibit considerable variability in the rate at which they age. Identifying biomarkers that distinguish fast from slow ageing is crucial for understanding the biology of ageing, enabling early disease detection, and improving prevention strategies. Using contrastive deep learning, we show that skin biopsy images alone are sufficient to determine an individual's age. We then use visual features in histopathology slides of the skin biopsies to construct a novel biomarker of ageing. By linking with comprehensive health registers in Denmark, we demonstrate that visual features in histopathology slides of skin biopsies predict mortality and the prevalence of chronic age-related diseases. Our work highlights how routinely collected health data can provide additional value when used together with deep learning, by creating a new biomarker for ageing which can be actively used to determine mortality over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ezra Ameperosa, Jeremy A. Collins, Mrinal Jain, Animesh Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning in robotics faces significant challenges in generalization due to the complexity of robotic environments and the high cost of data collection. We introduce RoCoDA, a novel method that unifies the concepts of invariance, equivariance, and causality within a single framework to enhance data augmentation for imitation learning. RoCoDA leverages causal invariance by modifying task-irrelevant subsets of the environment state without affecting the policy's output. Simultaneously, we exploit SE(3) equivariance by applying rigid body transformations to object poses and adjusting corresponding actions to generate synthetic demonstrations. We validate RoCoDA through extensive experiments on five robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improvements in policy performance, generalization, and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our policies exhibit robust generalization to unseen object poses, textures, and the presence of distractors. Furthermore, we observe emergent behavior such as re-grasping, indicating policies trained with RoCoDA possess a deeper understanding of task dynamics. By leveraging invariance, equivariance, and causality, RoCoDA provides a principled approach to data augmentation in imitation learning, bridging the gap between geometric symmetries and causal reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmenting glomerular intraglomerular tissue and lesions traditionally depends on detailed morphological evaluations by expert nephropathologists, a labor-intensive process susceptible to interobserver variability. Our group previously developed the Glo-In-One toolkit for integrated detection and segmentation of glomeruli. In this study, we leverage the Glo-In-One toolkit to version 2 with fine-grained segmentation capabilities, curating 14 distinct labels for tissue regions, cells, and lesions across a dataset of 23,529 annotated glomeruli across human and mouse histopathology data. To our knowledge, this dataset is among the largest of its kind to date.In this study, we present a single dynamic head deep learning architecture designed to segment 14 classes within partially labeled images of human and mouse pathology data. Our model was trained using a training set derived from 368 annotated kidney whole-slide images (WSIs) to identify 5 key intraglomerular tissues covering Bowman's capsule, glomerular tuft, mesangium, mesangial cells, and podocytes. Additionally, the network segments 9 glomerular lesion classes including adhesion, capsular drop, global sclerosis, hyalinosis, mesangial lysis, microaneurysm, nodular sclerosis, mesangial expansion, and segmental sclerosis. The glomerulus segmentation model achieved a decent performance compared with baselines, and achieved a 76.5 % average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Additional, transfer learning from rodent to human for glomerular lesion segmentation model has enhanced the average segmentation accuracy across different types of lesions by more than 3 %, as measured by Dice scores.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyur D. Shah, James A. Shackleford, Nagarajan Kandasamy, Gregory C. Sharp</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Deformable image registration (DIR) is critical in adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to account for anatomical changes. Conventional intensity-based DIR methods often fail when image intensities differ. This study evaluates a hybrid similarity metric combining intensity and structural information, leveraging CycleGAN-based intensity correction and auto-segmentation across three DIR workflows. Methods: A hybrid similarity metric combining a point-to-distance (PD) score and intensity similarity was implemented. Synthetic CT (sCT) images were generated using a 2D CycleGAN model trained on unpaired CT and CBCT images to enhance soft-tissue contrast. DIR workflows compared included: (1) traditional intensity-based (No PD), (2) auto-segmented contours on sCT (CycleGAN PD), and (3) expert manual contours (Expert PD). A 3D U-Net model trained on 56 images and validated on 14 cases segmented the prostate, bladder, and rectum. DIR accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD), and fiducial separation. Results: The hybrid metric improved DIR accuracy. For the prostate, DSC increased from 0.61+/-0.18 (No PD) to 0.82+/-0.13 (CycleGAN PD) and 0.89+/-0.05 (Expert PD), with reductions in 95% HD from 11.75 mm to 4.86 mm and 3.27 mm, respectively. Fiducial separation decreased from 8.95 mm to 4.07 mm (CycleGAN PD) and 4.11 mm (Expert PD) (p < 0.05). Improvements were also observed for the bladder and rectum. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a hybrid similarity metric using CycleGAN-based auto-segmentation improves DIR accuracy, particularly for low-contrast CBCT images. These findings highlight the potential for integrating AI-based image correction and segmentation into ART workflows to enhance precision and streamline clinical processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Cooper-Baldock, Paulo E. Santos, Russell S. A. Brinkworth, Karl Sammut</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in automotive, aerospace, maritime and medical applications, but are limited by the complexity, cost and computational requirements of directly calculating the flow, often taking days of compute time. Machine-learning architectures, such as controlled generative adversarial networks (cGANs) hold significant potential in enhancing or replacing CFD investigations, due to cGANs ability to approximate the underlying data distribution of a dataset. Unlike traditional cGAN applications, where the entire image carries information, CFD data contains small regions of highly variant data, immersed in a large context of low variance that is of minimal importance. This renders most existing deep learning techniques that give equal importance to every portion of the data during training, inefficient. To mitigate this, a novel loss function is proposed called Gradient Mean Squared Error (GMSE) which automatically and dynamically identifies the regions of importance on a field-by-field basis, assigning appropriate weights according to the local variance. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, three identical networks were trained; optimised with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, proposed GMSE loss and a dynamic variant of GMSE (DGMSE). The novel loss function resulted in faster loss convergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an 83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and ground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased ability to fool a discriminator network. It is hoped that this loss function will enable accelerated machine learning within computational fluid dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has proven effective in conditional diffusion model sampling for improved condition alignment, many applications use a negated CFG term to filter out unwanted features from samples. However, simply negating CFG guidance creates an inverted probability distribution, often distorting samples away from the marginal distribution. Inspired by recent advances in conditional diffusion models for inverse problems, here we present a novel method to enhance negative CFG guidance using contrastive loss. Specifically, our guidance term aligns or repels the denoising direction based on the given condition through contrastive loss, achieving a nearly identical guiding direction to traditional CFG for positive guidance while overcoming the limitations of existing negative guidance methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively removes undesirable concepts while maintaining sample quality across diverse scenarios, from simple class conditions to complex and overlapping text prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: To provide a lightweight and cost-effective solution for the long-wave infrared imaging using a singlet, we develop a camera by integrating a High-Frequency-Enhancing Cycle-GAN neural network into a metalens imaging system. The High-Frequency-Enhancing Cycle-GAN improves the quality of the original metalens images by addressing inherent frequency loss introduced by the metalens. In addition to the bidirectional cyclic generative adversarial network, it incorporates a high-frequency adversarial learning module. This module utilizes wavelet transform to extract high-frequency components, and then establishes a high-frequency feedback loop. It enables the generator to enhance the camera outputs by integrating adversarial feedback from the high-frequency discriminator. This ensures that the generator adheres to the constraints imposed by the high-frequency adversarial loss, thereby effectively recovering the camera's frequency loss. This recovery guarantees high-fidelity image output from the camera, facilitating smooth video production. Our camera is capable of achieving dynamic imaging at 125 frames per second with an End Point Error value of 12.58. We also achieve 0.42 for Fr\'echet Inception Distance, 30.62 for Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and 0.69 for Structural Similarity in the recorded videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of on-road object importance estimation, which utilizes video sequences captured from the driver's perspective as the input. Although this problem is significant for safer and smarter driving systems, the exploration of this problem remains limited. On one hand, publicly-available large-scale datasets are scarce in the community. To address this dilemma, this paper contributes a new large-scale dataset named Traffic Object Importance (TOI). On the other hand, existing methods often only consider either bottom-up feature or single-fold guidance, leading to limitations in handling highly dynamic and diverse traffic scenarios. Different from existing methods, this paper proposes a model that integrates multi-fold top-down guidance with the bottom-up feature. Specifically, three kinds of top-down guidance factors (ie, driver intention, semantic context, and traffic rule) are integrated into our model. These factors are important for object importance estimation, but none of the existing methods simultaneously consider them. To our knowledge, this paper proposes the first on-road object importance estimation model that fuses multi-fold top-down guidance factors with bottom-up feature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, achieving 23.1% Average Precision (AP) improvement compared with the recently proposed model (ie, Goal).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Thang Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical deep neural video compression networks usually follow the hybrid approach of classical video coding that contains two separate modules: motion coding and residual coding. In addition, a symmetric auto-encoder is often used as a normal architecture for both motion and residual coding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that handles the drawbacks of the two typical above-mentioned architectures, we call it kernel-based motion-free video coding. The advantages of the motion-free approach are twofold: it improves the coding efficiency of the network and significantly reduces computational complexity thanks to eliminating motion estimation, motion compensation, and motion coding which are the most time-consuming engines. In addition, the kernel-based auto-encoder alleviates blur artifacts that usually occur with the conventional symmetric autoencoder. Consequently, it improves the visual quality of the reconstructed frames. Experimental results show the proposed framework outperforms the SOTA deep neural video compression networks on the HEVC-class B dataset and is competitive on the UVG and MCL-JCV datasets. In addition, it generates high-quality reconstructed frames in comparison with conventional motion coding-based symmetric auto-encoder meanwhile its model size is much smaller than that of the motion-based networks around three to four times.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper contributes to the "BraTS 2024 Brain MR Image Synthesis Challenge" and presents a conditional Wavelet Diffusion Model (cWDM) for directly solving a paired image-to-image translation task on high-resolution volumes. While deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation models have demonstrated clear clinical utility, they typically require MR scans from various modalities (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR) as input. However, due to time constraints or imaging artifacts, some of these modalities may be missing, hindering the application of well-performing segmentation algorithms in clinical routine. To address this issue, we propose a method that synthesizes one missing modality image conditioned on three available images, enabling the application of downstream segmentation models. We treat this paired image-to-image translation task as a conditional generation problem and solve it by combining a Wavelet Diffusion Model for high-resolution 3D image synthesis with a simple conditioning strategy. This approach allows us to directly apply our model to full-resolution volumes, avoiding artifacts caused by slice- or patch-wise data processing. While this work focuses on a specific application, the presented method can be applied to all kinds of paired image-to-image translation problems, such as CT $\leftrightarrow$ MR and MR $\leftrightarrow$ PET translation, or mask-conditioned anatomically guided image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decision-making and planning in autonomous driving critically reflect the safety of the system, making effective planning imperative. Current imitation learning-based planning algorithms often merge historical trajectories with present observations to predict future candidate paths. However, these algorithms typically assess the current and historical plans independently, leading to discontinuities in driving intentions and an accumulation of errors with each step in a discontinuous plan. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces LHPF, an imitation learning planner that integrates historical planning information. Our approach employs a historical intention aggregation module that pools historical planning intentions, which are then combined with a spatial query vector to decode the final planning trajectory. Furthermore, we incorporate a comfort auxiliary task to enhance the human-like quality of the driving behavior. Extensive experiments using both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that LHPF not only surpasses existing advanced learning-based planners in planning performance but also marks the first instance of a purely learning-based planner outperforming the expert. Additionally, the application of the historical intention aggregation module across various backbones highlights the considerable potential of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting and quantifying bone changes in micro-CT scans of rodents is a common task in preclinical drug development studies. However, this task is manual, time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. In 2024, Anonymous Company organized an internal challenge to develop models for automatic bone quantification. We prepared and annotated a high-quality dataset of 3D $\mu$CT bone scans from $83$ mice. The challenge attracted over $80$ AI scientists from around the globe who formed $23$ teams. The participants were tasked with developing a solution to identify the plane where the bone growth happens, which is essential for fully automatic segmentation of trabecular bone. As a result, six computer vision solutions were developed that can accurately identify the location of the growth plate plane. The solutions achieved the mean absolute error of $1.91\pm0.87$ planes from the ground truth on the test set, an accuracy level acceptable for practical use by a radiologist. The annotated 3D scans dataset along with the six solutions and source code, is being made public, providing researchers with opportunities to develop and benchmark their own approaches. The code, trained models, and the data will be shared.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lehan He, Zeren Chen, Zhelun Shi, Tianyu Yu, Jing Shao, Lu Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning the behaviors of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with human preferences is crucial for developing robust and trustworthy AI systems. While recent attempts have employed human experts or powerful auxiliary AI systems to provide more accurate preference feedback, such as determining the preferable responses from MLLMs or directly rewriting hallucination-free responses, extensive resource overhead compromise the scalability of the feedback collection. In this work, we introduce Topic-level Preference Overwriting (TPO), a self-correctional approach that guide the model itself to mitigate its own hallucination at the topic level. Through a deconfounded strategy that replaces each topic within the response with the best or worst alternatives generated by the model itself, TPO creates more contrasting pairwise preference feedback, enhancing the feedback quality without human or proprietary model intervention. Notably, the experimental results demonstrate proposed TPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness, significantly reducing the object hallucinations by 92% and overall hallucinations by 38%. Code, model and data will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivica Kopriva</p>
<p>Abstract: Majority subspace clustering (SC) algorithms depend on one or more hyperparameters that need to be carefully tuned for the SC algorithms to achieve high clustering performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is often performed using grid-search, assuming that some labeled data is available. In some domains, such as medicine, this assumption does not hold true in many cases. One avenue of research focuses on developing SC algorithms that are inherently free of hyperparameters. For hyperparameters-dependent SC algorithms, one approach to label-independent HPO tuning is based on internal clustering quality metrics (if available), whose performance should ideally match that of external (label-dependent) clustering quality metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to label-independent HPO that uses clustering quality metrics, such as accuracy (ACC) or normalized mutual information (NMI), that are computed based on pseudo-labels obtained from the SC algorithm across a predefined grid of hyperparameters. Assuming that ACC (or NMI) is a smooth function of hyperparameter values it is possible to select subintervals of hyperparameters. These subintervals are then iteratively further split into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion is satisfied. In principle, the hyperparameters of any SC algorithm can be tuned using the proposed method. We demonstrate this approach on several single- and multi-view SC algorithms, comparing the achieved performance with their oracle versions across six datasets representing digits, faces and objects. The proposed method typically achieves clustering performance that is 5% to 7% lower than that of the oracle versions. We also make our proposed method interpretable by visualizing subspace bases, which are estimated from the computed clustering partitions. This aids in the initial selection of the hyperparameter search space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksei Luchinsky, Umar Islambekov</p>
<p>Abstract: Persistent homology is a widely-used tool in topological data analysis (TDA) for understanding the underlying shape of complex data. By constructing a filtration of simplicial complexes from data points, it captures topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids across multiple scales. These features are encoded in persistence diagrams (PDs), which provide a concise summary of the data's topological structure. However, the non-Hilbert nature of the space of PDs poses challenges for their direct use in machine learning applications. To address this, kernel methods and vectorization techniques have been developed to transform PDs into machine-learning-compatible formats. In this paper, we introduce a new software package designed to streamline the vectorization of PDs, offering an intuitive workflow and advanced functionalities. We demonstrate the necessity of the package through practical examples and provide a detailed discussion on its contributions to applied TDA. Definitions of all vectorization summaries used in the package are included in the appendix.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Wodzinski, Mateusz Daniol, Daria Hemmerling</p>
<p>Abstract: Every year, thousands of people suffer from skull damage and require personalized implants to fill the cranial cavity. Unfortunately, the waiting time for reconstruction surgery can extend to several weeks or even months, especially in less developed countries. One factor contributing to the extended waiting period is the intricate process of personalized implant modeling. Currently, the preparation of these implants by experienced biomechanical experts is both costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in deep learning, offer promising potential for automating the process. However, deep learning-based cranial reconstruction faces several challenges: (i) the limited size of training datasets, (ii) the high resolution of the volumetric data, and (iii) significant data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by enhancing the reconstruction through learnable symmetry enforcement. We demonstrate that it is possible to train a neural network dedicated to calculating skull symmetry, which can be utilized either as an additional objective function during training or as a post-reconstruction objective during the refinement step. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method using open SkullBreak and SkullFix datasets, and qualitatively using real clinical cases. The results indicate that the symmetry-preserving reconstruction network achieves considerably better outcomes compared to the baseline (0.94/0.94/1.31 vs 0.84/0.76/2.43 in terms of DSC, bDSC, and HD95). Moreover, the results are comparable to the best-performing methods while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (< 500 vs > 100,000 GPU hours). The proposed method is a considerable contribution to the field of applied artificial intelligence in medicine and is a step toward automatic cranial defect reconstruction in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bastian Wittmann, Yannick Wattenberg, Tamaz Amiranashvili, Suprosanna Shit, Bjoern Menze</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmenting 3D blood vessels is a critical yet challenging task in medical image analysis. This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtong Yue, Xin Lin, Zijiu Yang, Chao Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment for distorted images has always been a challenging problem due to image content variance and distortion diversity. Previous IQA models mostly encode explicit single-quality features of synthetic images to obtain quality-aware representations for quality score prediction. However, performance decreases when facing real-world distortion and restored images from restoration models. The reason is that they do not consider the degradation factors of the low-quality images adequately. To address this issue, we first introduce the DRI method to obtain degradation vectors and quality vectors of images, which separately model the degradation and quality information of low-quality images. After that, we add the restoration network to provide the MOS score predictor with degradation information. Then, we design the Representation-based Semantic Loss (RS Loss) to assist in enhancing effective interaction between representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben van Bergen, Justus H\"ubotter, Pablo Lanillos</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songning Lai, Mingqian Liao, Zhangyi Hu, Jiayu Yang, Wenshuo Chen, Yutao Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance model interpretability by introducing human-understandable concepts within the architecture. However, existing CBMs assume static datasets, limiting their ability to adapt to real-world, continuously evolving data streams. To address this, we define a novel concept-incremental and class-incremental continual learning task for CBMs, enabling models to accumulate new concepts and classes over time while retaining previously learned knowledge. To achieve this, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a framework that prevents catastrophic forgetting by reformulating concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems, thus eliminating the need for gradient-based updates. CONCIL requires only recursive matrix operations, making it computationally efficient and suitable for real-time and large-scale data applications. Experimental results demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and outperforms traditional CBM methods in concept- and class-incremental settings, establishing a new benchmark for continual learning in CBMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxu Zheng, Zhenrong Shen, Lichi Zhang, Qun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep-learning-based MR-to-CT synthesis can estimate the electron density of tissues, thereby facilitating PET attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR imaging. However, whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis faces several challenges including the issue of spatial misalignment and the complexity of intensity mapping, primarily due to the variety of tissues and organs throughout the whole body. Here we propose a novel whole-body MR-to-CT synthesis framework, which consists of three novel modules to tackle these challenges: (1) Structure-Guided Synthesis module leverages structure-guided attention gates to enhance synthetic image quality by diminishing unnecessary contours of soft tissues; (2) Spatial Alignment module yields precise registration between paired MR and CT images by taking into account the impacts of tissue volumes and respiratory movements, thus providing well-aligned ground-truth CT images during training; (3) Semantic Alignment module utilizes contrastive learning to constrain organ-related semantic information, thereby ensuring the semantic authenticity of synthetic CT images.We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed whole-body MR-to-CT framework can produce visually plausible and semantically realistic CT images, and validate its utility in PET attenuation correction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weimin Wu, Yi-Chen Lee, Yu-Chao Huang, Minshuo Chen, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the approximation and estimation rates of conditional diffusion transformers (DiTs) with classifier-free guidance. We present a comprehensive analysis for ``in-context'' conditional DiTs under four common data assumptions. We show that both conditional DiTs and their latent variants lead to the minimax optimality of unconditional DiTs under identified settings. Specifically, we discretize the input domains into infinitesimal grids and then perform a term-by-term Taylor expansion on the conditional diffusion score function under H\"older smooth data assumption. This enables fine-grained use of transformers' universal approximation through a more detailed piecewise constant approximation and hence obtains tighter bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the latent setting under the linear latent subspace assumption. We not only show that latent conditional DiTs achieve lower bounds than conditional DiTs both in approximation and estimation, but also show the minimax optimality of latent unconditional DiTs. Our findings establish statistical limits for conditional and unconditional DiTs, and offer practical guidance toward developing more efficient and accurate DiT models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Incorporating modern computer vision techniques into clinical protocols shows promise in improving skin lesion segmentation. The U-Net architecture has been a key model in this area, iteratively improved to address challenges arising from the heterogeneity of dermatologic images due to varying clinical settings, lighting, patient attributes, and hair density. To further improve skin lesion segmentation, we developed TAFM-Net, an innovative model leveraging self-adaptive transformer attention (TA) coupled with focal modulation (FM). Our model integrates an EfficientNetV2B1 encoder, which employs TA to enhance spatial and channel-related saliency, while a densely connected decoder integrates FM within skip connections, enhancing feature emphasis, segmentation performance, and interpretability crucial for medical image analysis. A novel dynamic loss function amalgamates region and boundary information, guiding effective model training. Our model achieves competitive performance, with Jaccard coefficients of 93.64\%, 86.88\% and 92.88\% in the ISIC2016, ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we apply the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation to the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find a combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score on in-domain and out-of-distribution data. We demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted for WMH segmentation and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration, with median class balanced accuracy for classification models with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) of 0.71/0.66/0.60 in the Deep WMH and 0.82/0.77/0.73 in the Periventricular WMH regions respectively. We demonstrate that stochastic UQ techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality segmentations. Finally, we qualitatively analyse the semantic information captured by UQ techniques and demonstrate that uncertainty can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions, while identifying clusters of small WMH in deep white matter unsegmented by the model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-based pose estimation of articulated robots with unknown joint angles has applications in collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction tasks. Current frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and downstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of robots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical structures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore, limiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint filtering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated on several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle estimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the lowest execution time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshita Gupta, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Karren Dai Yang, Richard He Bai, Zakaria Aldeneh, Navdeep Jaitly</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new task -- generating speech from videos of people and their transcripts (VTTS) -- to motivate new techniques for multimodal speech generation. This task generalizes the task of generating speech from cropped lip videos, and is also more complicated than the task of generating generic audio clips (e.g., dog barking) from videos and text. Multilingual versions of the task could lead to new techniques for cross-lingual dubbing. We also present a decoder-only multimodal model for this task, which we call Visatronic. This model embeds vision, text and speech directly into the common subspace of a transformer model and uses an autoregressive loss to learn a generative model of discretized mel-spectrograms conditioned on speaker videos and transcripts of their speech. By embedding all modalities into a common subspace, Visatronic can achieve improved results over models that use only text or video as input. Further, it presents a much simpler approach for multimodal speech generation compared to prevailing approaches which rely on lip-detectors and complicated architectures to fuse modalities while producing better results. Since the model is flexible enough to accommodate different ways of ordering inputs as a sequence, we carefully explore different strategies to better understand the best way to propagate information to the generative steps. To facilitate further research on VTTS, we will release (i) our code, (ii) clean transcriptions for the large-scale VoxCeleb2 dataset, and (iii) a standardized evaluation protocol for VTTS incorporating both objective and subjective metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilong Chen, Zhixiong Nan, Tao Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of predicting driver attention from the driving perspective is gaining increasing research focus due to its remarkable significance for autonomous driving and assisted driving systems. The driving experience is extremely important for safe driving,a skilled driver is able to effortlessly predict oncoming danger (before it becomes salient) based on the driving experience and quickly pay attention to the corresponding zones. However, the nonobjective driving experience is difficult to model, so a mechanism simulating the driver experience accumulation procedure is absent in existing methods, and the current methods usually follow the technique line of saliency prediction methods to predict driver attention. In this paper, we propose a FeedBack Loop Network (FBLNet), which attempts to model the driving experience accumulation procedure. By over-and-over iterations, FBLNet generates the incremental knowledge that carries rich historically-accumulative and long-term temporal information. The incremental knowledge in our model is like the driving experience of humans. Under the guidance of the incremental knowledge, our model fuses the CNN feature and Transformer feature that are extracted from the input image to predict driver attention. Our model exhibits a solid advantage over existing methods, achieving an outstanding performance improvement on two driver attention benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even outperform GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochen Ma, Bo Du, Zhuohang Jiang, Xia Du, Ahmed Y. Al Hammadi, Jizhe Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced image tampering techniques are increasingly challenging the trustworthiness of multimedia, leading to the development of Image Manipulation Localization (IML). But what makes a good IML model? The answer lies in the way to capture artifacts. Exploiting artifacts requires the model to extract non-semantic discrepancies between manipulated and authentic regions, necessitating explicit comparisons between the two areas. With the self-attention mechanism, naturally, the Transformer should be a better candidate to capture artifacts. However, due to limited datasets, there is currently no pure ViT-based approach for IML to serve as a benchmark, and CNNs dominate the entire task. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from weak long-range and non-semantic modeling. To bridge this gap, based on the fact that artifacts are sensitive to image resolution, amplified under multi-scale features, and massive at the manipulation border, we formulate the answer to the former question as building a ViT with high-resolution capacity, multi-scale feature extraction capability, and manipulation edge supervision that could converge with a small amount of data. We term this simple but effective ViT paradigm IML-ViT, which has significant potential to become a new benchmark for IML. Extensive experiments on three different mainstream protocols verified our model outperforms the state-of-the-art manipulation localization methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengqun Zhao, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel visual-language model called DFER-CLIP, which is based on the CLIP model and designed for in-the-wild Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER). Specifically, the proposed DFER-CLIP consists of a visual part and a textual part. For the visual part, based on the CLIP image encoder, a temporal model consisting of several Transformer encoders is introduced for extracting temporal facial expression features, and the final feature embedding is obtained as a learnable "class" token. For the textual part, we use as inputs textual descriptions of the facial behaviour that is related to the classes (facial expressions) that we are interested in recognising -- those descriptions are generated using large language models, like ChatGPT. This, in contrast to works that use only the class names and more accurately captures the relationship between them. Alongside the textual description, we introduce a learnable token which helps the model learn relevant context information for each expression during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that our DFER-CLIP also achieves state-of-the-art results compared with the current supervised DFER methods on the DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Pardyl, Grzegorz Kurzejamski, Jan Olszewski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers have excelled in various computer vision tasks but mostly rely on rigid input sampling using a fixed-size grid of patches. It limits their applicability in real-world problems, such as active visual exploration, where patches have various scales and positions. Our paper addresses this limitation by formalizing the concept of input elasticity for vision transformers and introducing an evaluation protocol for measuring this elasticity. Moreover, we propose modifications to the transformer architecture and training regime, which increase its elasticity. Through extensive experimentation, we spotlight opportunities and challenges associated with such architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Roetzer, Ahmed Abbas, Dongliang Cao, Florian Bernard, Paul Swoboda</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we propose to combine the advantages of learningbased and combinatorial formalisms for 3D shape matching. While learningbased methods lead to state-of-the-art matching performance, they do not ensure geometric consistency, so that obtained matchings are locally non-smooth. On the contrary, axiomatic, optimisation-based methods allow to take geometric consistency into account by explicitly constraining the space of valid matchings. However, existing axiomatic formalisms do not scale to practically relevant problem sizes, and require user input for the initialisation of non-convex optimisation problems. We work towards closing this gap by proposing a novel combinatorial solver that combines a unique set of favourable properties: our approach (i) is initialisation free, (ii) is massively parallelisable and powered by a quasi-Newton method, (iii) provides optimality gaps, and (iv) delivers improved matching quality with decreased runtime and globally optimal results for many instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Ma, Jiancheng Pan, Cong Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-text retrieval has developed rapidly in recent years. However, it is still a challenge in remote sensing due to visual-semantic imbalance, which leads to incorrect matching of non-semantic visual and textual features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Direction-Oriented Visual-semantic Embedding Model (DOVE) to mine the relationship between vision and language. Our highlight is to conduct visual and textual representations in latent space, directing them as close as possible to a redundancy-free regional visual representation. Concretely, a Regional-Oriented Attention Module (ROAM) adaptively adjusts the distance between the final visual and textual embeddings in the latent semantic space, oriented by regional visual features. Meanwhile, a lightweight Digging Text Genome Assistant (DTGA) is designed to expand the range of tractable textual representation and enhance global word-level semantic connections using less attention operations. Ultimately, we exploit a global visual-semantic constraint to reduce single visual dependency and serve as an external constraint for the final visual and textual representations. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are verified by extensive experiments including parameter evaluation, quantitative comparison, ablation studies and visual analysis, on two benchmark datasets, RSICD and RSITMD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyu Wu, Tianhong Dai, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), which aims to train segmentation models solely using image-level labels, has achieved significant attention. Existing methods primarily focus on generating high-quality pseudo labels using available images and their image-level labels. However, the quality of pseudo labels degrades significantly when the size of available dataset is limited. Thus, in this paper, we tackle this problem from a different view by introducing a novel approach called Image Augmentation with Controlled Diffusion (IACD). This framework effectively augments existing labeled datasets by generating diverse images through controlled diffusion, where the available images and image-level labels are served as the controlling information. Moreover, we also propose a high-quality image selection strategy to mitigate the potential noise introduced by the randomness of diffusion models. In the experiments, our proposed IACD approach clearly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. This effect is more obvious when the amount of available data is small, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new, unsupervised method for automatic video summarization using ideas from generative adversarial networks but eliminating the discriminator, having a simple loss function, and separating training of different parts of the model. An iterative training strategy is also applied by alternately training the reconstructor and the frame selector for multiple iterations.

Results from experiments on two public datasets (SumMe and TVSum) and four datasets we created (Soccer, LoL, MLB, and ShortMLB) demonstrate the effectiveness of each component on the model performance, particularly the iterative training strategy. Evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods highlight the advantages of the proposed method in performance, stability, and training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhai Li, Huaibin Wang, Kuo-Kun Tseng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D, known for its efficient generation methods and expansive creative potential, has garnered significant attention in the AIGC domain. However, the pixel-wise rendering of NeRF and its ray marching light sampling constrain the rendering speed, impacting its utility in downstream industrial applications. Gaussian Splatting has recently shown a trend of replacing the traditional pointwise sampling technique commonly used in NeRF-based methodologies, and it is changing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework, Gaussian Diffusion, based on Gaussian Splatting and produces more realistic renderings. The challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by 3D Gaussian Splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational Gaussian Splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive utilization of Gaussian Diffusion across the entire spectrum of 3D content generation processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Yao, Jusheng Zhang, Xiaochao Pan, Tong Wu, Canran Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of 3D semantic scene completion using monocular cameras is gaining significant attention in the field of autonomous driving. This task aims to predict the occupancy status and semantic labels of each voxel in a 3D scene from partial image inputs. Despite numerous existing methods, many face challenges such as inaccurately predicting object shapes and misclassifying object boundaries. To address these issues, we propose DepthSSC, an advanced method for semantic scene completion using only monocular cameras. DepthSSC integrates the Spatial Transformation Graph Fusion (ST-GF) module with Geometric-Aware Voxelization (GAV), enabling dynamic adjustment of voxel resolution to accommodate the geometric complexity of 3D space. This ensures precise alignment between spatial and depth information, effectively mitigating issues such as object boundary distortion and incorrect depth perception found in previous methods. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that DepthSSC not only captures intricate 3D structural details effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human perception plays a vital role in forming beliefs and understanding reality. A deeper understanding of brain functionality will lead to the development of novel deep neural networks. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brainformer, a straightforward yet effective Transformer-based framework, to analyze Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) patterns in the human perception system from a machine-learning perspective. Specifically, we present the Multi-scale fMRI Transformer to explore brain activity patterns through fMRI signals. This architecture includes a simple yet efficient module for high-dimensional fMRI signal encoding and incorporates a novel embedding technique called 3D Voxels Embedding. Secondly, drawing inspiration from the functionality of the brain's Region of Interest, we introduce a novel loss function called Brain fMRI Guidance Loss. This loss function mimics brain activity patterns from these regions in the deep neural network using fMRI data. This work introduces a prospective approach to transferring knowledge from human perception to neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that leveraging fMRI information allows the machine vision model to achieve results comparable to State-of-the-Art methods in various image recognition tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Liu, Cairong Zhang, Yitong Wang, Jiahao Wang, Yujiu Yang, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to achieve universal segmentation of arbitrary semantic level. Despite significant progress in recent years, specialist segmentation approaches are limited to specific tasks and data distribution. Retraining a new model for adaptation to new scenarios or settings takes expensive computation and time cost, which raises the demand for versatile and universal segmentation model that can cater to various granularity. Although some attempts have been made for unifying different segmentation tasks or generalization to various scenarios, limitations in the definition of paradigms and input-output spaces make it difficult for them to achieve accurate understanding of content at arbitrary granularity. To this end, we present UniLSeg, a universal segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with the guidance of language instructions. For training UniLSeg, we reorganize a group of tasks from original diverse distributions into a unified data format, where images with texts describing segmentation targets as input and corresponding masks are output. Combined with a automatic annotation engine for utilizing numerous unlabeled data, UniLSeg achieves excellent performance on various tasks and settings, surpassing both specialist and unified segmentation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) through calibrating in-vocabulary and domain-biased embedding space with generalized contextual prior of CLIP. As the core of open-vocabulary understanding, alignment of visual content with the semantics of unbounded text has become the bottleneck of this field. To address this challenge, recent works propose to utilize CLIP as an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP classification results. Despite their remarkable progress, performance of OVS methods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised counterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and domain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end, we present a Semantic-assisted CAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN, we incorporate generalized semantic prior of CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories. Besides, a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global context and unnatural background noise. With above designs, SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. Furthermore, we also focus on the problem of existing evaluation system that ignores semantic duplication across categories, and propose a new metric called Semantic-Guided IoU (SG-IoU).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qishen Chen, Jianzhi Liu, Xinyu Lyu, Lianli Gao, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) endeavors to predict the relationships between subjects and objects in a given image. Nevertheless, the long-tail distribution of relations often leads to biased prediction on coarse labels, presenting a substantial hurdle in SGG. To address this issue, researchers focus on unbiased SGG and introduce data transfer methods to transfer coarse-grained predicates into fine-grained ones across the entire dataset. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) They overlook the inherent context constraints imposed by subject-object pairs, leading to erroneous relations transfer. 2) Additional retraining process are required after the data transfer, which incurs substantial computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first plug-and-play one-stage data transfer pipeline in SGG, termed Adaptive Label Finetuning (ALF), which eliminates the need for extra retraining sessions and meanwhile significantly enhance models' relation recognition capability across various SGG benchmark approaches. Specifically, ALF consists of two components: Adaptive Label Construction (ALC) and Adaptive Iterative Learning (AIL). By imposing Predicate-Context Constraints within relation space, ALC adaptively re-ranks and selects candidate relations in reference to model's predictive logits utilizing the Restriction-Based Judgment techniques, achieving robust relation transfer. Supervised with labels transferred by ALC, AIL iteratively finetunes the SGG models in an auto-regressive manner, which mitigates the substantial computational costs arising from the retraining process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALF achieves a 16% improvement in mR@100 compared to the typical SGG method Motif, with only a 6% increase in calculation costs compared to the state-of-the-art method IETrans.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents BioNeRF, a biologically plausible architecture that models scenes in a 3D representation and synthesizes new views through radiance fields. Since NeRF relies on the network weights to store the scene's 3-dimensional representation, BioNeRF implements a cognitive-inspired mechanism that fuses inputs from multiple sources into a memory-like structure, improving the storing capacity and extracting more intrinsic and correlated information. BioNeRF also mimics a behavior observed in pyramidal cells concerning contextual information, in which the memory is provided as the context and combined with the inputs of two subsequent neural models, one responsible for producing the volumetric densities and the other the colors used to render the scene. Experimental results show that BioNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art results concerning a quality measure that encodes human perception in two datasets: real-world images and synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the usage of Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) as a pre-training technique improves the performance of learning with noisy labels (LNL) methods. However, instead of pre-training, when trivially combining CRL loss with LNL methods as an end-to-end framework, the empirical experiments show severe degeneration of the performance. We verify through experiments that this issue is caused by optimization conflicts of losses and propose an end-to-end \textbf{PLReMix} framework by introducing a Pseudo-Label Relaxed (PLR) contrastive loss. This PLR loss constructs a reliable negative set of each sample by filtering out its inappropriate negative pairs, alleviating the loss conflicts by trivially combining these losses. The proposed PLR loss is pluggable and we have integrated it into other LNL methods, observing their improved performance. Furthermore, a two-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model is adopted to distinguish clean and noisy samples by leveraging semantic information and model outputs simultaneously. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/lxysl/PLReMix}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.</p>

<p>Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, leading to the proliferation of various advanced models and diverse downstream applications. However, despite these significant advancements, current diffusion models still suffer from several limitations, including inferior visual quality, inadequate aesthetic appeal, and inefficient inference, without a comprehensive solution in sight. To address these challenges, we present UniFL, a unified framework that leverages feedback learning to enhance diffusion models comprehensively. UniFL stands out as a universal, effective, and generalizable solution applicable to various diffusion models, such as SD1.5 and SDXL. Notably, UniFL consists of three key components: perceptual feedback learning, which enhances visual quality; decoupled feedback learning, which improves aesthetic appeal; and adversarial feedback learning, which accelerates inference. In-depth experiments and extensive user studies validate the superior performance of our method in enhancing generation quality and inference acceleration. For instance, UniFL surpasses ImageReward by 17% user preference in terms of generation quality and outperforms LCM and SDXL Turbo by 57% and 20% general preference with 4-step inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpu Wang, Guili Xu, Chunlei Li, Guangshuai Gao, Yuehua Cheng, Bing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection using only normal samples is of great significance for quality inspection in industrial manufacturing. Although existing reconstruction-based methods have achieved promising results, they still face two problems: poor distinguishable information in image reconstruction and well abnormal regeneration caused by model under-regularization. To overcome the above issues, we convert the image reconstruction into a combination of parallel feature restorations and propose a multi-feature reconstruction network, MFRNet, using crossed-mask restoration in this paper. Specifically, a multi-scale feature aggregator is first developed to generate more discriminative hierarchical representations of the input images from a pre-trained model. Subsequently, a crossed-mask generator is adopted to randomly cover the extracted feature map, followed by a restoration network based on the transformer structure for high-quality repair of the missing regions. Finally, a hybrid loss is equipped to guide model training and anomaly estimation, which gives consideration to both the pixel and structural similarity. Extensive experiments show that our method is highly competitive with or significantly outperforms other state-of-the-arts on four public available datasets and one self-made dataset.</p>

Visual text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks have been popular in controllable text-to-image generation. However, each of these tasks typically focuses on single modality generation or rendering, leaving yet-to-be-bridged gaps between the approaches correspondingly designed for each of the tasks. In this paper, we combine text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks into a single task: layout-controllable text-object synthesis (LTOS) task, aiming at synthesizing images with object and visual text based on predefined object layout and text contents. As compliant datasets are not readily available for our LTOS task, we construct a layout-aware text-object synthesis dataset, containing elaborate well-aligned labels of visual text and object information. Based on the dataset, we propose a layout-controllable text-object adaptive fusion (TOF) framework, which generates images with clear, legible visual text and plausible objects. We construct a visual-text rendering module to synthesize text and employ an object-layout control module to generate objects while integrating the two modules to harmoniously generate and integrate text content and objects in images. To better the image-text integration, we propose a self-adaptive cross-attention fusion module that helps the image generation to attend more to important text information. Within such a fusion module, we use a self-adaptive learnable factor to learn to flexibly control the influence of cross-attention outputs on image generation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in LTOS, text rendering, and layout-to-image tasks, enabling harmonious visual text rendering and object generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Chang, Boyang Liu, Yifei Xia, Weimin Bai, Youming Guo, Boxin Shi, He Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for the 3D reconstruction of satellites in low-Earth orbit, utilizing videos captured by small amateur telescopes. The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang-Huy Che, Le-Chuong Nguyen, Vinh-Tiep Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task that involves identifying the same person across different camera views in surveillance systems. Current methods usually rely on features from single-camera views, which can be limiting when dealing with multiple cameras and challenges such as changing viewpoints and occlusions. In this paper, a new approach is introduced that enhances the capability of ReID models through the Uncertain Feature Fusion Method (UFFM) and Auto-weighted Measure Combination (AMC). UFFM generates multi-view features using features extracted independently from multiple images to mitigate view bias. However, relying only on similarity based on multi-view features is limited because these features ignore the details represented in single-view features. Therefore, we propose the AMC method to generate a more robust similarity measure by combining various measures. Our method significantly improves Rank@1 accuracy and Mean Average Precision (mAP) when evaluated on person re-identification datasets. Combined with the BoT Baseline on challenging datasets, we achieve impressive results, with a 7.9% improvement in Rank@1 and a 12.1% improvement in mAP on the MSMT17 dataset. On the Occluded-DukeMTMC dataset, our method increases Rank@1 by 22.0% and mAP by 18.4%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-Bac Nguyen, Hojin Jang, Xin Li, Samee U. Khan, Pawan Sinha, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: The human brain is a highly efficient processing unit, and understanding how it works can inspire new algorithms and architectures in machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brain Activation Network (BRACTIVE), a transformer-based approach to studying the human visual brain. The main objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with corresponding brain representations via fMRI signals. It allows us to identify the brain's Regions of Interest (ROI) of the subjects. Unlike previous brain research methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and are limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this identification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that BRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as face and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and indicating potential applicability to various object categories. More importantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep neural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks. It encourages the potential of BRACTIVE in both neuroscience and machine intelligence studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengqun Zhao, Yu Cao, Shaogang Gong, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Current facial expression recognition (FER) models are often designed in a supervised learning manner and thus are constrained by the lack of large-scale facial expression images with high-quality annotations. Consequently, these models often fail to generalize well, performing poorly on unseen images in inference. Vision-language-based zero-shot models demonstrate a promising potential for addressing such challenges. However, these models lack task-specific knowledge and therefore are not optimized for the nuances of recognizing facial expressions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel method, Exp-CLIP, to enhance zero-shot FER by transferring the task knowledge from large language models (LLMs). Specifically, based on the pre-trained vision-language encoders, we incorporate a projection head designed to map the initial joint vision-language space into a space that captures representations of facial actions. To train this projection head for subsequent zero-shot predictions, we propose to align the projected visual representations with task-specific semantic meanings derived from the LLM encoder, and the text instruction-based strategy is employed to customize the LLM knowledge. Given unlabelled facial data and efficient training of the projection head, Exp-CLIP achieves superior zero-shot results to the CLIP models and several other large vision-language models (LVLMs) on seven in-the-wild FER datasets. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/zengqunzhao/Exp-CLIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangbo Yu, Chaoran Feng, Jiye Tang, Jiashu Yang, Xu Jia, Yuchao Yang, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, its training heavily depends on high-quality, sharp images and accurate camera poses. Fulfilling these requirements can be challenging in non-ideal real-world scenarios, where motion-blurred images are commonly encountered in high-speed moving cameras or low-light environments that require long exposure times. To address these challenges, we introduce Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting (EvaGaussians), a novel approach that integrates event streams captured by an event camera to assist in reconstructing high-quality 3D-GS from blurry images. Capitalizing on the high temporal resolution and dynamic range offered by the event camera, we leverage the event streams to explicitly model the formation process of motion-blurred images and guide the deblurring reconstruction of 3D-GS. By jointly optimizing the 3D-GS parameters and recovering camera motion trajectories during the exposure time, our method can robustly facilitate the acquisition of high-fidelity novel views with intricate texture details. We comprehensively evaluated our method and compared it with previous state-of-the-art deblurring rendering methods. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method surpasses existing techniques in restoring fine details from blurry images and producing high-fidelity novel views.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yang, Yingmin Luo, Zhongang Qi, Yang Wu, Ying Shan, Chang Wen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Layout generation is the keystone in achieving automated graphic design, requiring arranging the position and size of various multi-modal design elements in a visually pleasing and constraint-following manner. Previous approaches are either inefficient for large-scale applications or lack flexibility for varying design requirements. Our research introduces a unified framework for automated graphic layout generation, leveraging the multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to accommodate diverse design tasks. In contrast, our data-driven method employs structured text (JSON format) and visual instruction tuning to generate layouts under specific visual and textual constraints, including user-defined natural language specifications. We conducted extensive experiments and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public multi-modal layout generation benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, recognizing existing datasets' limitations in capturing the complexity of real-world graphic designs, we propose two new datasets for much more challenging tasks (user-constrained generation and complicated poster), further validating our model's utility in real-life settings. Marking by its superior accessibility and adaptability, this approach further automates large-scale graphic design tasks. Finally, we develop an automated text-to-poster system that generates editable SVG posters based on users' design intentions, bridging the gap between layout generation and real-world graphic design applications. This system integrates our proposed layout generation method as the core component, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Tang, Xinyu Zhang, Lixinyu Xu, Yao Lu, Wenyan Li, Pontus Stenetorp, Jimmy Lin, Ferhan Ture</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are the state of the art in text-to-image generation, but their perceptual variability remains understudied. In this paper, we examine how prompts affect image variability in black-box diffusion-based models. We propose W1KP, a human-calibrated measure of variability in a set of images, bootstrapped from existing image-pair perceptual distances. Current datasets do not cover recent diffusion models, thus we curate three test sets for evaluation. Our best perceptual distance outperforms nine baselines by up to 18 points in accuracy, and our calibration matches graded human judgements 78% of the time. Using W1KP, we study prompt reusability and show that Imagen prompts can be reused for 10-50 random seeds before new images become too similar to already generated images, while Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 can be reused 50-200 times. Lastly, we analyze 56 linguistic features of real prompts, finding that the prompt's length, CLIP embedding norm, concreteness, and word senses influence variability most. As far as we are aware, we are the first to analyze diffusion variability from a visuolinguistic perspective. Our project page is at http://w1kp.com.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Xu, Yuxin Chen, Jiahao Nie, Yusong Wang, Huiping Zhuang, Manabu Okumura</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has overcome the constraints of traditional CL, which only focuses on previously encountered classes. During the CL of VLMs, we need not only to prevent the catastrophic forgetting on incrementally learned knowledge but also to preserve the zero-shot ability of VLMs. However, existing methods require additional reference datasets to maintain such zero-shot ability and rely on domain-identity hints to classify images across different domains. In this study, we propose Regression-based Analytic Incremental Learning (RAIL), which utilizes a recursive ridge regression-based adapter to learn from a sequence of domains in a non-forgetting manner and decouple the cross-domain correlations by projecting features to a higher-dimensional space. Cooperating with a training-free fusion module, RAIL absolutely preserves the VLM's zero-shot ability on unseen domains without any reference data. Additionally, we introduce Cross-domain Task-Agnostic Incremental Learning (X-TAIL) setting. In this setting, a CL learner is required to incrementally learn from multiple domains and classify test images from both seen and unseen domains without any domain-identity hint. We theoretically prove RAIL's absolute memorization on incrementally learned domains. Experiment results affirm RAIL's state-of-the-art performance in both X-TAIL and existing Multi-domain Task-Incremental Learning settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Nourilenjan Nokabadi, Yann Batiste Pequignot, Jean-Francois Lalonde, Christian Gagn\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial perturbations can deceive neural networks by adding small, imperceptible noise to the input. Recent object trackers with transformer backbones have shown strong performance on tracking datasets, but their adversarial robustness has not been thoroughly evaluated. While transformer trackers are resilient to black-box attacks, existing white-box adversarial attacks are not universally applicable against these new transformer trackers due to differences in backbone architecture. In this work, we introduce TrackPGD, a novel white-box attack that utilizes predicted object binary masks to target robust transformer trackers. Built upon the powerful segmentation attack SegPGD, our proposed TrackPGD effectively influences the decisions of transformer-based trackers. Our method addresses two primary challenges in adapting a segmentation attack for trackers: limited class numbers and extreme pixel class imbalance. TrackPGD uses the same number of iterations as other attack methods for tracker networks and produces competitive adversarial examples that mislead transformer and non-transformer trackers such as MixFormerM, OSTrackSTS, TransT-SEG, and RTS on datasets including VOT2022STS, DAVIS2016, UAV123, and GOT-10k.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models have shown impressive progress in recent years. However, existing models are largely limited to turn-based interactions, where each turn must be stepped (i.e., prompted) by the user. Open-ended, asynchronous interactions, where an AI model may proactively deliver timely responses or feedback based on the unfolding situation in real-time, are an open challenge. In this work, we present the QEVD benchmark and dataset, which explores human-AI interaction in the challenging, yet controlled, real-world domain of fitness coaching -- a task which intrinsically requires monitoring live user activity and providing immediate feedback. The benchmark requires vision-language models to recognize complex human actions, identify possible mistakes, and provide appropriate feedback in real-time. Our experiments reveal the limitations of existing state-of-the-art vision-language models for such asynchronous situated interactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple end-to-end streaming baseline that can respond asynchronously to human actions with appropriate feedback at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately recovering images from phaseless measurements is a challenging and long-standing problem. In this work, we present "deepECpr," which combines expectation-consistent (EC) approximation with deep denoising networks to surpass state-of-the-art phase-retrieval methods in both speed and accuracy. In addition to applying EC in a non-traditional manner, deepECpr includes a novel stochastic damping scheme that is inspired by recent diffusion methods. Like existing phase-retrieval methods based on plug-and-play priors, regularization by denoising, or diffusion, deepECpr iterates a denoising stage with a measurement-exploitation stage. But unlike existing methods, deepECpr requires far fewer denoiser calls. We compare deepECpr to the state-of-the-art prDeep (Metzler et al., 2018), Deep-ITA (Wang et al., 2020), DOLPH (Shoushtari et al., 2023), and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (Chung et al., 2023) methods for noisy phase-retrieval of color, natural, and unnatural grayscale images on oversampled-Fourier and coded-diffraction-pattern measurements and find improvements in both PSNR and SSIM with significantly fewer denoiser calls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Allgeuer, Kyra Ahrens, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NOVIC, an innovative real-time uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an "object decoder" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels from essentially the entire English language to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image, and without any label biases. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Fujii, Ryo Hachiuma, Hideo Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: A crowd density forecasting task aims to predict how the crowd density map will change in the future from observed past crowd density maps. However, the past crowd density maps are often incomplete due to the miss-detection of pedestrians, and it is crucial to develop a robust crowd density forecasting model against the miss-detection. This paper presents a MAsked crowd density Completion framework for crowd density forecasting (CrowdMAC), which is simultaneously trained to forecast future crowd density maps from partially masked past crowd density maps (i.e., forecasting maps from past maps with miss-detection) while reconstructing the masked observation maps (i.e., imputing past maps with miss-detection). Additionally, we propose Temporal-Density-aware Masking (TDM), which non-uniformly masks tokens in the observed crowd density map, considering the sparsity of the crowd density maps and the informativeness of the subsequent frames for the forecasting task. Moreover, we introduce multi-task masking to enhance training efficiency. In the experiments, CrowdMAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven large-scale datasets, including SDD, ETH-UCY, inD, JRDB, VSCrowd, FDST, and croHD. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method against both synthetic and realistic miss-detections. The code is released at https://fujiry0.github.io/CrowdMAC-project-page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Lahlali, Nicolas Granger, Herv\'e Le Borgne, Quoc-Cuong Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and augmented reality. However, training 3D detectors requires a costly precise annotation, which is a hindrance to scaling annotation to large datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a weakly supervised 3D annotator that relies solely on 2D bounding box annotations from images, along with size priors. One major problem is that supervising a 3D detection model using only 2D boxes is not reliable due to ambiguities between different 3D poses and their identical 2D projection. We introduce a simple yet effective and generic solution: we build 3D proxy objects with annotations by construction and add them to the training dataset. Our method requires only size priors to adapt to new classes. To better align 2D supervision with 3D detection, our method ensures depth invariance with a novel expression of the 2D losses. Finally, to detect more challenging instances, our annotator follows an offline pseudo-labelling scheme which gradually improves its 3D pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method not only performs on-par or above previous works on the Car category, but also achieves performance close to fully supervised methods on more challenging classes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by being the first to experiment on the more challenging nuScenes dataset. We additionally propose a setting where weak labels are obtained from a 2D detector pre-trained on MS-COCO instead of human annotations. The code is available at https://github.com/CEA-LIST/ALPI</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnisha Khondaker, Nilanjan Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Tuning parameters of a non-differentiable or black-box compute is challenging. Existing methods rely mostly on random sampling or grid sampling from the parameter space. Further, with all the current methods, it is not possible to supply any input specific parameters to the black-box. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we are able to learn input-specific parameters for a black box in this work. As a test application, we choose a popular image denoising method BM3D as our black-box compute. Then, we use a differentiable surrogate model (a neural network) to approximate the black-box behaviour. Next, another neural network is used in an end-to-end fashion to learn input instance-specific parameters for the black-box. Motivated by prior advances in surrogate-based optimization, we applied our method to the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and the Color Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (CBSD68) for image denoising. The results are compelling, demonstrating a significant increase in PSNR and a notable improvement in SSIM nearing 0.93. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in achieving substantial improvements in both model performance and optimization efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingcai Guo, Zhijie Rao, Zhi Chen, Song Guo, Jingren Zhou, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot image recognition (ZSIR) aims to recognize and reason in unseen domains by learning generalized knowledge from limited data in the seen domain. The gist of ZSIR is constructing a well-aligned mapping between the input visual space and the target semantic space, which is a bottom-up paradigm inspired by the process by which humans observe the world. In recent years, ZSIR has witnessed significant progress on a broad spectrum, from theory to algorithm design, as well as widespread applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there remains a lack of a systematic review of ZSIR from an element-wise perspective, i.e., learning fine-grained elements of data and their inferential associations. To fill the gap, this paper thoroughly investigates recent advances in element-wise ZSIR and provides a sound basis for its future development. Concretely, we first integrate three basic ZSIR tasks, i.e., object recognition, compositional recognition, and foundation model-based open-world recognition, into a unified element-wise paradigm and provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of the main approaches. Next, we summarize the benchmarks, covering technical implementations, standardized datasets, and some more details as a library. Last, we sketch out related applications, discuss vital challenges, and suggest potential future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulin Ren, Xin Li, Mengxi Guo, Bingchen Li, Shijie Zhao, Zhibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MambaCSR, a simple but effective framework based on Mamba for the challenging compressed image super-resolution (CSR) task. Particularly, the scanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge modeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space modeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies: (i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture and utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by simultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential scanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed to reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning of different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we also propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown the great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution task. The code will be soon available in~\textcolor{magenta}{\url{https://github.com/renyulin-f/MambaCSR}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gr\'egoire Petit, Nathan Palluau, Axel Bauer, Clemens Dlaska</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of machine learning to medical ultrasound videos of the heart, i.e., echocardiography, has recently gained traction with the availability of large public datasets. Traditional supervised tasks, such as ejection fraction regression, are now making way for approaches focusing more on the latent structure of data distributions, as well as generative methods. We propose a model trained exclusively by knowledge distillation, either on real or synthetical data, involving retrieving masks suggested by a teacher model. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) values on the task of identifying end-diastolic and end-systolic frames. By training the model only on synthetic data, it reaches segmentation capabilities close to the performance when trained on real data with a significantly reduced number of weights. A comparison with the 5 main existing methods shows that our method outperforms the others in most cases. We also present a new evaluation method that does not require human annotation and instead relies on a large auxiliary model. We show that this method produces scores consistent with those obtained from human annotations. Relying on the integrated knowledge from a vast amount of records, this method overcomes certain inherent limitations of human annotator labeling. Code: https://github.com/GregoirePetit/EchoDFKD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisheng Su, Wei Wu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods resort to unifying modular designs for various tasks (e.g. perception, prediction and planning). Although optimized in a planning-oriented spirit with a fully differentiable framework, existing end-to-end driving systems without ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, owing to the rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we revisit the human driving behavior and propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named DiFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, DiFSD mainly consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection, tracking and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. Besides, both position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thus facilitating the training stability and convergence of the whole framework. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superior planning performance and great efficiency of DiFSD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Bernabeu-Perez, Enrique Lopez-Cuena, Dario Garcia-Gasulla</p>
<p>Abstract: The continued release of increasingly realistic image generation models creates a demand for synthetic image detectors. To build effective detectors we must first understand how factors like data source diversity, training methodologies and image alterations affect their generalization capabilities. This work conducts a systematic analysis and uses its insights to develop practical guidelines for training robust synthetic image detectors. Model generalization capabilities are evaluated across different setups (e.g. scale, sources, transformations) including real-world deployment conditions. Through an extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art detectors across diverse and recent datasets, we show that while current approaches excel in specific scenarios, no single detector achieves universal effectiveness. Critical flaws are identified in detectors, and workarounds are proposed to enable the deployment of real-world detector applications enhancing accuracy, reliability and robustness beyond the limitations of current systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomasz Stanczyk, Francois Bremond</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) involves identifying and consistently tracking objects across video sequences. Traditional tracking-by-detection methods, while effective, often require extensive tuning and lack generalizability. On the other hand, segmentation mask-based methods are more generic but struggle with tracking management, making them unsuitable for MOT. We propose a novel approach, McByte, which incorporates a temporally propagated segmentation mask as a strong association cue within a tracking-by-detection framework. By combining bounding box and propagated mask information, McByte enhances robustness and generalizability without per-sequence tuning. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets - DanceTrack, MOT17, SoccerNet-tracking 2022, and KITTI-tracking - McByte demonstrates performance gain in all cases examined. At the same time, it outperforms existing mask-based methods. Implementation code will be provided upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailai Feng, Yabo Zhang, Haodong Yu, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Hongzhi Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Artistic typography is a technique to visualize the meaning of input character in an imaginable and readable manner. With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch and training-free method, namely VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography along with controllable geometry change to maintain the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of Subject and Surrounding, followed by rendering them under varying degrees of geometry transformation. The subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions of subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional decomposition detects the part that most matches the subject description and divides input glyph image into subject and surrounding regions. (iii) Typography Stylization firstly refines the structure of subject region via Semantic Typography, and then separately renders the textures of Subject and Surrounding regions through Controllable Compositional Generation. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability, but also manages to depict multiple customize concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart Jahn, Sarah Fl\"ugge, Dajie Zhang, Luise Poustka, Sven B\"olte, Florentin W\"org\"otter, Peter B Marschik, Tomas Kulvicius</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study we compare the performance of available generic- and infant-pose estimators for a video-based automated general movement assessment (GMA), and the choice of viewing angle for optimal recordings, i.e., conventional diagonal view used in GMA vs. top-down view. We used 4500 annotated video-frames from 75 recordings of infant spontaneous motor functions from 4 to 26 weeks. To determine which pose estimation method and camera angle yield the best pose estimation accuracy on infants in a GMA related setting, the distance to human annotations and the percentage of correct key-points (PCK) were computed and compared. The results show that the best performing generic model trained on adults, ViTPose, also performs best on infants. We see no improvement from using infant-pose estimators over the generic pose estimators on our infant dataset. However, when retraining a generic model on our data, there is a significant improvement in pose estimation accuracy. The pose estimation accuracy obtained from the top-down view is significantly better than that obtained from the diagonal view, especially for the detection of the hip key-points. The results also indicate limited generalization capabilities of infant-pose estimators to other infant datasets, which hints that one should be careful when choosing infant pose estimators and using them on infant datasets which they were not trained on. While the standard GMA method uses a diagonal view for assessment, pose estimation accuracy significantly improves using a top-down view. This suggests that a top-down view should be included in recording setups for automated GMA research.</p>

Additionally, we leverage high-quality training data, integrate micro-conditions informed by human preference scores, and employ feature compression layers to further enhance image fidelity and resolution. Our model not only matches but often exceeds the performance of existing models like SDXL in generating high-quality, high-resolution images. Extensive experiments validate Meissonic's capabilities, demonstrating its potential as a new standard in text-to-image synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xumeng Han, Longhui Wei, Zhiyang Dou, Zipeng Wang, Chenhui Qiang, Xin He, Yingfei Sun, Zhenjun Han, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models embody the divide-and-conquer concept and are a promising approach for increasing model capacity, demonstrating excellent scalability across multiple domains. In this paper, we integrate the MoE structure into the classic Vision Transformer (ViT), naming it ViMoE, and explore the potential of applying MoE to vision through a comprehensive study on image classification and semantic segmentation. However, we observe that the performance is sensitive to the configuration of MoE layers, making it challenging to obtain optimal results without careful design. The underlying cause is that inappropriate MoE layers lead to unreliable routing and hinder experts from effectively acquiring helpful information. To address this, we introduce a shared expert to learn and capture common knowledge, serving as an effective way to construct stable ViMoE. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to analyze expert routing behavior, revealing which MoE layers are capable of specializing in handling specific information and which are not. This provides guidance for retaining the critical layers while removing redundancies, thereby advancing ViMoE to be more efficient without sacrificing accuracy. We aspire for this work to offer new insights into the design of vision MoE models and provide valuable empirical guidance for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Shack, Katarina Petrovic, Olga Saukh</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to the robustness and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in computer vision applications. This study investigates the performance of adversarial patches for the YOLO object detection network in the physical world. Two attacks were tested: a patch designed to be placed anywhere within the scene - global patch, and another patch intended to partially overlap with specific object targeted for removal from detection - local patch. Various factors such as patch size, position, rotation, brightness, and hue were analyzed to understand their impact on the effectiveness of the adversarial patches. The results reveal a notable dependency on these parameters, highlighting the challenges in maintaining attack efficacy in real-world conditions. Learning to align digitally applied transformation parameters with those measured in the real world still results in up to a 64\% discrepancy in patch performance. These findings underscore the importance of understanding environmental influences on adversarial attacks, which can inform the development of more robust defenses for practical machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanjian Song, Mingbao Lin, Wengyi Zhan, Shuicheng Yan, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents UniVST, a unified framework for localized video style transfer based on diffusion model. It operates without the need for training, offering a distinct advantage over existing diffusion methods that transfer style across entire videos. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (1) A point-matching mask propagation strategy that leverages the feature maps from the DDIM inversion. This streamlines the model's architecture by obviating the need for tracking models. (2) A training-free AdaIN-guided video style transfer mechanism that operates at both the latent and attention levels. This balances content fidelity and style richness, mitigating the loss of localized details commonly associated with direct video stylization. (3) A sliding-window consistent smoothing scheme that harnesses optical flow within the pixel representation and refines predicted noise to update the latent space. This significantly enhances temporal consistency and diminishes artifacts in stylized video. Our proposed UniVST has been validated to be superior to existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics. It adeptly addresses the challenges of preserving the primary object's style while ensuring temporal consistency and detail preservation.

This work introduces a fine-tuning approach that integrates LLMs with the pretrained CLIP visual encoder, leveraging LLMs' advanced text understanding and open-world knowledge to improve CLIP's ability to process long and complex captions. To address the challenge of LLMs' autoregressive nature, we propose a caption-to-caption contrastive learning framework to enhance the discriminative power of their outputs. Our method achieves substantial performance gains on various downstream tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs with CLIP for enhanced multimodal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentang Song, Zhiyuan Yan, Yuzhen Lin, Taiping Yao, Changsheng Chen, Shen Chen, Yandan Zhao, Shouhong Ding, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the generalization issue in deepfake detection by harnessing forgery quality in training data. Generally, the forgery quality of different deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while others are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of deepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to short-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby hurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel quality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of a Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning pacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training process. The framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to gradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples, starting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ both static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining their scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating score guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated samples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a novel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality forgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their overall realism. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied in a plug-and-play manner and significantly enhance the generalization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation technologies are developing rapidly and have broad potential applications. Among these technologies, camera control is crucial for generating professional-quality videos that accurately meet user expectations. However, existing camera control methods still suffer from several limitations, including control precision and the neglect of the control for subject motion dynamics. In this work, we propose I2VControl-Camera, a novel camera control method that significantly enhances controllability while providing adjustability over the strength of subject motion. To improve control precision, we employ point trajectory in the camera coordinate system instead of only extrinsic matrix information as our control signal. To accurately control and adjust the strength of subject motion, we explicitly model the higher-order components of the video trajectory expansion, not merely the linear terms, and design an operator that effectively represents the motion strength. We use an adapter architecture that is independent of the base model structure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes show that our framework outperformances previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nyle Siddiqui, Florinel Alin Croitoru, Gaurav Kumar Nayak, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations. While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and increase their clothing diversity by 10X, totaling over 2.1M images generated. DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features. With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance. On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of 11.3% by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data. We publicly release our code and generated data for each dataset here: https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/dlcr.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Presta, Enzo Tartaglione, Attilio Fiandrotti, Marco Grangetto, Pamela Cosman</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned progressive image compression is gaining momentum as it allows improved image reconstruction as more bits are decoded at the receiver. We propose a progressive image compression method in which an image is first represented as a pair of base-quality and top-quality latent representations. Next, a residual latent representation is encoded as the element-wise difference between the top and base representations. Our scheme enables progressive image compression with element-wise granularity by introducing a masking system that ranks each element of the residual latent representation from most to least important, dividing it into complementary components, which can be transmitted separately to the decoder in order to obtain different reconstruction quality. The masking system does not add further parameters nor complexity. At the receiver, any elements of the top latent representation excluded from the transmitted components can be independently replaced with the mean predicted by the hyperprior architecture, ensuring reliable reconstructions at any intermediate quality level. We also introduced Rate Enhancement Modules (REMs), which refine the estimation of entropy parameters using already decoded components. We obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art competitors, while significantly reducing computational complexity, decoding time, and number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guowei Xu, Peng Jin, Hao Li, Yibing Song, Lichao Sun, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-han Li, Yunhao Yang, Mohammad Omama, Sandeep Chinchali, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents perceive and interpret their surroundings by integrating multimodal inputs, such as vision, audio, and LiDAR. These perceptual modalities support retrieval tasks, such as place recognition in robotics. However, current multimodal retrieval systems encounter difficulties when parts of the data are missing due to sensor failures or inaccessibility, such as silent videos or LiDAR scans lacking RGB information. We propose Any2Any-a novel retrieval framework that addresses scenarios where both query and reference instances have incomplete modalities. Unlike previous methods limited to the imputation of two modalities, Any2Any handles any number of modalities without training generative models. It calculates pairwise similarities with cross-modal encoders and employs a two-stage calibration process with conformal prediction to align the similarities. Any2Any enables effective retrieval across multimodal datasets, e.g., text-LiDAR and text-time series.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Jingcai Guo, Song Guo, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton action recognition is a non-trivial task that requires robust unseen generalization with prior knowledge from only seen classes and shared semantics. Existing methods typically build the skeleton-semantics interactions by uncontrollable mappings and conspicuous representations, thereby can hardly capture the intricate and fine-grained relationship for effective cross-modal transferability. To address these issues, we propose a novel dyNamically Evolving dUal skeleton-semantic syneRgistic framework with the guidance of cOntext-aware side informatioN (dubbed Neuron), to explore more fine-grained cross-modal correspondence from micro to macro perspectives at both spatial and temporal levels, respectively. Concretely, 1) we first construct the spatial-temporal evolving micro-prototypes and integrate dynamic context-aware side information to capture the intricate and synergistic skeleton-semantic correlations step-by-step, progressively refining cross-model alignment; and 2) we introduce the spatial compression and temporal memory mechanisms to guide the growth of spatial-temporal micro-prototypes, enabling them to absorb structure-related spatial representations and regularity-dependent temporal patterns. Notably, such processes are analogous to the learning and growth of neurons, equipping the framework with the capacity to generalize to novel unseen action categories. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoqing Wang, Xiaobo Xia, Runnan Chen, Dongdong Yu, Changhu Wang, Mingming Gong, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Large Vision Diffusion Transformer (LaVin-DiT), a scalable and unified foundation model designed to tackle over 20 computer vision tasks in a generative framework. Unlike existing large vision models directly adapted from natural language processing architectures, which rely on less efficient autoregressive techniques and disrupt spatial relationships essential for vision data, LaVin-DiT introduces key innovations to optimize generative performance for vision tasks. First, to address the high dimensionality of visual data, we incorporate a spatial-temporal variational autoencoder that encodes data into a continuous latent space. Second, for generative modeling, we develop a joint diffusion transformer that progressively produces vision outputs. Third, for unified multi-task training, in-context learning is implemented. Input-target pairs serve as task context, which guides the diffusion transformer to align outputs with specific tasks within the latent space. During inference, a task-specific context set and test data as queries allow LaVin-DiT to generalize across tasks without fine-tuning. Trained on extensive vision datasets, the model is scaled from 0.1B to 3.4B parameters, demonstrating substantial scalability and state-of-the-art performance across diverse vision tasks. This work introduces a novel pathway for large vision foundation models, underscoring the promising potential of diffusion transformers. The code and models will be open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xulong Zhang, Xiaoyang Qu, Haoxiang Shi, Chunguang Xiao, Jianzong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 3D speech-to-animation (STA) generation framework designed to address the shortcomings of existing models in producing diverse and emotionally resonant animations. Current STA models often generate animations that lack emotional depth and variety, failing to align with human expectations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel STA model coupled with a reward model. This combination enables the decoupling of emotion and content under audio conditions through a cross-coupling training approach. Additionally, we develop a training methodology that leverages automatic quality evaluation of generated facial animations to guide the reinforcement learning process. This methodology encourages the STA model to explore a broader range of possibilities, resulting in the generation of diverse and emotionally expressive facial animations of superior quality. We conduct extensive empirical experiments on a benchmark dataset, and the results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in generating high-quality, emotionally rich 3D animations that are better aligned with human preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a comprehensive understanding of 3D environments to facilitate high-level tasks such as motion prediction, planning, and mapping. In this paper, we introduce DriveMLLM, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving. DriveMLLM includes 880 front-facing camera images and introduces both absolute and relative spatial reasoning tasks, accompanied by linguistically diverse natural language questions. To measure MLLMs' performance, we propose novel evaluation metrics focusing on spatial understanding. We evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs on DriveMLLM, and our results reveal the limitations of current models in understanding complex spatial relationships in driving contexts. We believe these findings underscore the need for more advanced MLLM-based spatial reasoning methods and highlight the potential for DriveMLLM to drive further research in autonomous driving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Tian, Qi Dai, Jianmin Bao, Kai Qiu, Yifan Yang, Chong Luo, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain much more redundant information than images, thus can be encoded by very few motion latents based on a content image. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE to encode a video to an extremely compressed motion latent space. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Training diffusion models on such a compact representation easily allows for generating 1K resolution videos. We then adopt a two-stage video generation paradigm, which performs text-to-image and text-image-to-video sequentially. Extensive experiments show that our Reducio-DiT achieves strong performance in evaluation, though trained with limited GPU resources. More importantly, our method significantly boost the efficiency of video LDMs both in training and inference. We train Reducio-DiT in around 3.2K training hours in total and generate a 16-frame 1024*1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seong Jong Yoo, Snehesh Shrestha, Irina Muresanu, Cornelia Ferm\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Musicians delicately control their bodies to generate music. Sometimes, their motions are too subtle to be captured by the human eye. To analyze how they move to produce the music, we need to estimate precise 4D human pose (3D pose over time). However, current state-of-the-art (SoTA) visual pose estimation algorithms struggle to produce accurate monocular 4D poses because of occlusions, partial views, and human-object interactions. They are limited by the viewing angle, pixel density, and sampling rate of the cameras and fail to estimate fast and subtle movements, such as in the musical effect of vibrato. We leverage the direct causal relationship between the music produced and the human motions creating them to address these challenges. We propose VioPose: a novel multimodal network that hierarchically estimates dynamics. High-level features are cascaded to low-level features and integrated into Bayesian updates. Our architecture is shown to produce accurate pose sequences, facilitating precise motion analysis, and outperforms SoTA. As part of this work, we collected the largest and the most diverse calibrated violin-playing dataset, including video, sound, and 3D motion capture poses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Songlin Li, Lingyan Hao, Xinyu Hu, Bowen Song</p>
<p>Abstract: As video generation models advance rapidly, assessing the quality of generated videos has become increasingly critical. Existing metrics, such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), Inception Score (IS), and ClipSim, measure quality primarily in latent space rather than from a human visual perspective, often overlooking key aspects like appearance and motion consistency to physical laws. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, VAMP (Visual Appearance and Motion Plausibility), that evaluates both the visual appearance and physical plausibility of generated videos. VAMP is composed of two main components: an appearance score, which assesses color, shape, and texture consistency across frames, and a motion score, which evaluates the realism of object movements. We validate VAMP through two experiments: corrupted video evaluation and generated video evaluation. In the corrupted video evaluation, we introduce various types of corruptions into real videos and measure the correlation between corruption severity and VAMP scores. In the generated video evaluation, we use state-of-the-art models to generate videos from carefully designed prompts and compare VAMP's performance to human evaluators' rankings. Our results demonstrate that VAMP effectively captures both visual fidelity and temporal consistency, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of video quality than traditional methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Cai, He Zhang, Kai Zhang, Yixun Liang, Mengwei Ren, Fujun Luan, Qing Liu, Soo Ye Kim, Jianming Zhang, Zhifei Zhang, Yuqian Zhou, Zhe Lin, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing feed-forward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric prompt images. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object and scene generation from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generalization ability of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that our method enjoys better generation quality (2.20 dB higher in PSNR and 23.25 lower in FID) and over 5x faster speed (~6s on an A100 GPU) than SOTA methods. The user study and text-to-3D applications also reveals the practical values of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhou Tang, Dejun Xu, Yongjie Hou, Zhenzhong Wang, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated remarkable rendering quality and efficiency in 3D scene reconstruction, it struggles with varying lighting conditions and incidental occlusions in real-world scenarios. To accommodate varying lighting conditions, existing 3DGS extensions apply color mapping to the massive Gaussian primitives with individually optimized appearance embeddings. To handle occlusions, they predict pixel-wise uncertainties via 2D image features for occlusion capture. Nevertheless, such massive color mapping and pixel-wise uncertainty prediction strategies suffer from not only additional computational costs but also coarse-grained lighting and occlusion handling. In this work, we propose a nexus kernel-driven approach, termed NexusSplats, for efficient and finer 3D scene reconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular, NexusSplats leverages a novel light decoupling strategy where appearance embeddings are optimized based on nexus kernels instead of massive Gaussian primitives, thus accelerating reconstruction speeds while ensuring local color consistency for finer textures. Additionally, a Gaussian-wise uncertainty mechanism is developed, aligning 3D structures with 2D image features for fine-grained occlusion handling. Experimental results demonstrate that NexusSplats achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing reconstruction time by up to 70.4% compared to the current best in quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiwon Jang, Sihyun Yu, Jinwoo Shin, Pieter Abbeel, Younggyo Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision models that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\times$128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Held, Renaud Vandeghen, Abdullah Hamdi, Adrien Deliege, Anthony Cioppa, Silvio Giancola, Andrea Vedaldi, Bernard Ghanem, Marc Van Droogenbroeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives. However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending. Specifically, our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives. Our results highlight the potential of 3D Convex Splatting to become the new standard for high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Project page: convexsplatting.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Datao Tang, Xiangyong Cao, Xuan Wu, Jialin Li, Jing Yao, Xueru Bai, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image object detection (RSIOD) aims to identify and locate specific objects within satellite or aerial imagery. However, there is a scarcity of labeled data in current RSIOD datasets, which significantly limits the performance of current detection algorithms. Although existing techniques, e.g., data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, can mitigate this scarcity issue to some extent, they are heavily dependent on high-quality labeled data and perform worse in rare object classes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a layout-controllable diffusion generative model (i.e. AeroGen) tailored for RSIOD. To our knowledge, AeroGen is the first model to simultaneously support horizontal and rotated bounding box condition generation, thus enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic images that meet specific layout and object category requirements. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation framework that integrates a diversity-conditioned generator and a filtering mechanism to enhance both the diversity and quality of generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data produced by our method are of high quality and diversity. Furthermore, the synthetic RSIOD data can significantly improve the detection performance of existing RSIOD models, i.e., the mAP metrics on DIOR, DIOR-R, and HRSC datasets are improved by 3.7%, 4.3%, and 2.43%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Xu, Boyuan Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Donghao Luo, Qingdong He, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yunsheng Wu, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging the large generative prior of the flow transformer for tuning-free image editing requires authentic inversion to project the image into the model's domain and a flexible invariance control mechanism to preserve non-target contents. However, the prevailing diffusion inversion performs deficiently in flow-based models, and the invariance control cannot reconcile diverse rigid and non-rigid editing tasks. To address these, we systematically analyze the \textbf{inversion and invariance} control based on the flow transformer. Specifically, we unveil that the Euler inversion shares a similar structure to DDIM yet is more susceptible to the approximation error. Thus, we propose a two-stage inversion to first refine the velocity estimation and then compensate for the leftover error, which pivots closely to the model prior and benefits editing. Meanwhile, we propose the invariance control that manipulates the text features within the adaptive layer normalization, connecting the changes in the text prompt to image semantics. This mechanism can simultaneously preserve the non-target contents while allowing rigid and non-rigid manipulation, enabling a wide range of editing types such as visual text, quantity, facial expression, etc. Experiments on versatile scenarios validate that our framework achieves flexible and accurate editing, unlocking the potential of the flow transformer for versatile image editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VIRES, a video instance repainting method with sketch and text guidance, enabling video instance repainting, replacement, generation, and removal. Existing approaches struggle with temporal consistency and accurate alignment with the provided sketch sequence. VIRES leverages the generative priors of text-to-video models to maintain temporal consistency and produce visually pleasing results. We propose the Sequential ControlNet with the standardized self-scaling, which effectively extracts structure layouts and adaptively captures high-contrast sketch details. We further augment the diffusion transformer backbone with the sketch attention to interpret and inject fine-grained sketch semantics. A sketch-aware encoder ensures that repainted results are aligned with the provided sketch sequence. Additionally, we contribute the VireSet, a dataset with detailed annotations tailored for training and evaluating video instance editing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VIRES, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, temporal consistency, condition alignment, and human ratings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime Corsetti, Francesco Giuliari, Alice Fasoli, Davide Boscaini, Fabio Poiesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches. Project page: https://jcorsetti.github.io/fun3du</p>

The core design of these algorithmic frameworks can be summarized as follows: (1) Task paradigm, focusing on lane instance-level discrimination; (2) Lane modeling, representing lanes as a set of learnable parameters in the neural network; (3) Global context supplementation, enhancing the detection of obscure lanes; (4) Perspective effect elimination, providing 3D lanes usable for downstream applications. From these perspectives, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing methods, encompassing both the increasingly mature 2D lane detection approaches and the developing 3D lane detection works. For a relatively fair comparison, in addition to comparing the performance of mainstream methods on different benchmarks, their inference speed is also investigated under a unified setting. Moreover, we present some extended works on lane detection, including multi-task perception, video lane detection, online high-definition map construction, and lane topology reasoning, to offer readers a comprehensive roadmap for the evolution of lane detection. Finally, we point out some potential future research directions in this field. We exhaustively collect the papers and codes of existing works at https://github.com/Core9724/Awesome-Lane-Detection and will keep tracing the research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Sick, Dominik Engel, Sebastian Hartwig, Pedro Hermosilla, Timo Ropinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, algorithms that learn to segment object instances in 2D images have heavily relied on large amounts of human-annotated data. Only recently, novel approaches have emerged tackling this problem in an unsupervised fashion. Generally, these approaches first generate pseudo-masks and then train a class-agnostic detector. While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Olszewski, Dawid Rymarczyk, Piotr W\'ojcik, Mateusz Pach, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Active Visual Exploration (AVE) optimizes the utilization of robotic resources in real-world scenarios by sequentially selecting the most informative observations. However, modern methods require a high computational budget due to processing the same observations multiple times through the autoencoder transformers.
  As a remedy, we introduce a novel approach to AVE called TOken REcycling (TORE). It divides the encoder into extractor and aggregator components. The extractor processes each observation separately, enabling the reuse of tokens passed to the aggregator. Moreover, to further reduce the computations, we decrease the decoder to only one block.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TORE outperforms state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by up to 90\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamish Haggerty, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Early cancer detection is crucial for prognosis, but many cancer types lack large labelled datasets required for developing deep learning models. This paper investigates self-supervised learning (SSL) as an alternative to the standard supervised pre-training on ImageNet for scenarios with limited training data using a deep learning model (ResNet-50). We first demonstrate that SSL pre-training on ImageNet (via the Barlow Twins SSL algorithm) outperforms supervised pre-training (SL) using a skin lesion dataset with limited training samples. We then consider \textit{further} SSL pre-training (of the two ImageNet pre-trained models) on task-specific datasets, where our implementation is motivated by supervised transfer learning. This approach significantly enhances initially SL pre-trained models, closing the performance gap with initially SSL pre-trained ones. Surprisingly, further pre-training on just the limited fine-tuning data achieves this performance equivalence. Linear probe experiments reveal that improvement stems from enhanced feature extraction. Hence, we find that minimal further SSL pre-training on task-specific data can be as effective as large-scale SSL pre-training on ImageNet for medical image classification tasks with limited labelled data. We validate these results on an oral cancer histopathology dataset, suggesting broader applicability across medical imaging domains facing labelled data scarcity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given that no existing graph construction method can generate a perfect graph for a given dataset, graph-based algorithms are often affected by redundant and erroneous edges present within the constructed graphs. In this paper, we view these noisy edges as adversarial attack and propose to use a spectral adversarial robustness evaluation method to mitigate the impact of noisy edges on the performance of graph-based algorithms. Our method identifies the points that are less vulnerable to noisy edges and leverages only these robust points to perform graph-based algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our methodology is highly effective and outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ri-Zhao Qiu, Yafei Hu, Yuchen Song, Ge Yang, Yang Fu, Jianglong Ye, Jiteng Mu, Ruihan Yang, Nikolay Atanasov, Sebastian Scherer, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: An open problem in mobile manipulation is how to represent objects and scenes in a unified manner so that robots can use both for navigation and manipulation. The latter requires capturing intricate geometry while understanding fine-grained semantics, whereas the former involves capturing the complexity inherent at an expansive physical scale. In this work, we present GeFF (Generalizable Feature Fields), a scene-level generalizable neural feature field that acts as a unified representation for both navigation and manipulation that performs in real-time. To do so, we treat generative novel view synthesis as a pre-training task, and then align the resulting rich scene priors with natural language via CLIP feature distillation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by deploying GeFF on a quadrupedal robot equipped with a manipulator. We quantitatively evaluate GeFF's ability for open-vocabulary object-/part-level manipulation and show that GeFF outperforms point-based baselines in runtime and storage-accuracy trade-offs, with qualitative examples of semantics-aware navigation and articulated object manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Waida, Kimihiro Yamazaki, Atsushi Tokuhisa, Mutsuyo Wada, Yuichiro Wada</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyu Chen, Kwantae Kim, Chang Gao, Sheng Zhou, Taekwang Jang, Tobi Delbruck, Shih-Chii Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces DeltaKWS, to the best of our knowledge, the first $\Delta$RNN-enabled fine-grained temporal sparsity-aware KWS IC for voice-controlled devices. The 65 nm prototype chip features a number of techniques to enhance performance, area, and power efficiencies, specifically: 1) a bio-inspired delta-gated recurrent neural network ($\Delta$RNN) classifier leveraging temporal similarities between neighboring feature vectors extracted from input frames and network hidden states, eliminating unnecessary operations and memory accesses; 2) an IIR BPF-based FEx that leverages mixed-precision quantization, low-cost computing structure and channel selection; 3) a 24 kB 0.6 V near-$V_\text{TH}$ weight SRAM that achieves 6.6X lower read power than the foundry-provided SRAM. From chip measurement results, we show that the DeltaKWS achieves an 11/12-class GSCD accuracy of 90.5%/89.5% respectively and energy consumption of 36 nJ/decision in 65 nm CMOS process. At 87% temporal sparsity, computing latency and energy/inference are reduced by 2.4X/3.4X, respectively. The IIR BPF-based FEx, $\Delta$RNN accelerator, and 24 kB near-$V_\text{TH}$ SRAM blocks occupy 0.084 mm$^{2}$, 0.319 mm$^{2}$, and 0.381 mm$^{2}$ respectively (0.78 mm$^{2}$ in total).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Li, Jing Dong, Tianxing He, Jingzhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Aghelan, Ali Amiryan, Abolfazl Zarghani, Modjtaba Rouhani</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), transformer-based models, have demonstrated significant advancements. However, the potential and efficiency of these models in applied fields such as real-world image super-resolution have been less noticed and there are substantial opportunities for improvement. Recently, composite fusion attention transformer (CFAT), outperformed previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in classic image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based framework by incorporating the CFAT model to effectively exploit the performance of transformers in real-world image super-resolution. In our proposed approach, we integrate a semantic-aware discriminator to reconstruct fine details more accurately and employ an adaptive degradation model to better simulate real-world degradations. Moreover, we introduce a new combination of loss functions by adding wavelet loss to loss functions of GAN-based models to better recover high-frequency details. Empirical results demonstrate that IG-CFAT significantly outperforms existing SOTA models in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our proposed model revolutionizes the field of real-world image super-resolution and demonstrates substantially better performance in recovering fine details and generating realistic textures. The introduction of IG-CFAT offers a robust and adaptable solution for real-world image super-resolution tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Labbaf Khaniki, Marzieh Mirzaeibonehkhater, Mohammad Manthouri, Elham Hasani</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain tumor classification is a challenging task in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to brain tumor classification using a vision transformer with a novel cross-attention mechanism. Our approach leverages the strengths of transformers in modeling long-range dependencies and multi-scale feature fusion. We introduce two new mechanisms to improve the performance of the cross-attention fusion module: Feature Calibration Mechanism (FCM) and Selective Cross-Attention (SCA). FCM calibrates the features from different branches to make them more compatible, while SCA selectively attends to the most informative features. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in brain tumor classification, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency. The proposed FCM and SCA mechanisms can be easily integrated into other vision transformer architectures, making them a promising direction for future research in medical image analysis. Experimental results confirm that our approach surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Liu, Juan Zhang, Chongqi Ren, Shenghui Xu, Zhaoming Pan, Zhimin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: CDR (Cross-Domain Recommendation), i.e., leveraging information from multiple domains, is a critical solution to data sparsity problem in recommendation system. The majority of previous research either focused on single-target CDR (STCDR) by utilizing data from the source domains to improve the model's performance on the target domain, or applied dual-target CDR (DTCDR) by integrating data from the source and target domains. In addition, multi-target CDR (MTCDR) is a generalization of DTCDR, which is able to capture the link among different domains. In this paper we present HGDR (Heterogeneous Graph-based Framework with Disentangled Representations Learning), an end-to-end heterogeneous network architecture where graph convolutional layers are applied to model relations among different domains, meanwhile utilizes the idea of disentangling representation for domain-shared and domain-specifc information. First, a shared heterogeneous graph is generated by gathering users and items from several domains without any further side information. Second, we use HGDR to compute disentangled representations for users and items in all domains. Experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests prove that our proposed model can transmit information among domains effectively and reach the SOTA performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pirzada Suhail, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools across various applications, yet their decision-making process often remains opaque, leading to them being perceived as "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns about their interpretability and reliability, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Network inversion techniques offer a solution by allowing us to peek inside these black boxes, revealing the features and patterns learned by the networks behind their decision-making processes and thereby provide valuable insights into how neural networks arrive at their conclusions, making them more interpretable and trustworthy. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to network inversion using a meticulously conditioned generator that learns the data distribution in the input space of the trained neural network, enabling the reconstruction of inputs that would most likely lead to the desired outputs. To capture the diversity in the input space for a given output, instead of simply revealing the conditioning labels to the generator, we encode the conditioning label information into vectors and intermediate matrices and further minimize the cosine similarity between features of the generated images.</p>

<p>Abstract: QUIC, an increasingly adopted transport protocol, addresses limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. However, these enhancements also introduce challenges for network operators in monitoring and analyzing web traffic, especially due to QUIC's encryption. Existing datasets are inadequate they are often outdated, lack diversity, anonymize critical information, or exclude essential features like SSL keys-limiting comprehensive research and development in this area. We introduce VisQUIC, a publicly available dataset of over 100,000 labeled QUIC traces with corresponding SSL keys, collected from more than 40,000 websites over four months. By generating visual representations of the traces, we facilitate advanced machine learning (ML) applications and in-depth analysis of encrypted QUIC traffic. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we estimate the number of HTTP3 request-response pairs in a QUIC connection using only encrypted traffic, achieving up to 92% accuracy. This estimation provides insights into server behavior, client-server interactions, and connection load-crucial for tasks like load balancing and intrusion detection. Our dataset enables comprehensive studies on QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols and supports the development of tools for encrypted traffic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yule Wang, Chengrui Li, Weihan Li, Anqi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armeet Singh Jatyani, Jiayun Wang, Aditi Chandrashekar, Zihui Wu, Miguel Liu-Schiaffini, Bahareh Tolooshams, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressed Sensing MRI reconstructs images of the body's internal anatomy from undersampled measurements, thereby reducing the scan time - the time subjects need to remain still. Recently, deep neural networks have shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements in the frequency space. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements.
  We propose a unified model robust to different measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions in compressed sensing MRI. Our model is based on neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture. Neural operators are employed in both image and measurement space, which capture local and global image features for MRI reconstruction. Empirically, we achieve consistent performance across different undersampling rates and patterns, with an average 11 percent SSIM and 4dB PSNR improvement over a state-of-the-art CNN, End-to-End VarNet. For efficiency, our inference speed is also 1,400x faster than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enhances zero-shot super-resolution and extended field of view in reconstructed images. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

<p>Abstract: Utilizing the complementary strengths of wavelength-specific range or depth sensors is crucial for robust computer-assisted tasks such as autonomous driving. Despite this, there is still little research done at the intersection of optical depth sensors and radars operating close range, where the target is decimeters away from the sensors. Together with a growing interest in high-resolution imaging radars operating in the near field, the question arises how these sensors behave in comparison to their traditional optical counterparts.
  In this work, we take on the unique challenge of jointly characterizing depth imagers from both, the optical and radio-frequency domain using a multimodal spatial calibration. We collect data from four depth imagers, with three optical sensors of varying operation principle and an imaging radar. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of their depth measurements with respect to distinct object materials, geometries, and object-to-sensor distances. Specifically, we reveal scattering effects of partially transmissive materials and investigate the response of radio-frequency signals. All object measurements will be made public in form of a multimodal dataset, called MAROON.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wojciech {\L}apacz, Daniel Marczak, Filip Szatkowski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a critical area in machine learning, enabling neural networks to learn from evolving data distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, recent research has identified the stability gap -- a phenomenon where models initially lose performance on previously learned tasks before partially recovering during training. Such learning dynamics are contradictory to the intuitive understanding of stability in continual learning where one would expect the performance to degrade gradually instead of rapidly decreasing and then partially recovering later. To better understand and alleviate the stability gap, we investigate it at different levels of the neural network architecture, particularly focusing on the role of the classification head. We introduce the nearest-mean classifier (NMC) as a tool to attribute the influence of the backbone and the classification head on the stability gap. Our experiments demonstrate that NMC not only improves final performance, but also significantly enhances training stability across various continual learning benchmarks, including CIFAR100, ImageNet100, CUB-200, and FGVC Aircrafts. Moreover, we find that NMC also reduces task-recency bias. Our analysis provides new insights into the stability gap and suggests that the primary contributor to this phenomenon is the linear head, rather than the insufficient representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lechao Cheng, Kaifeng Chen, Jiyang Li, Shengeng Tang, Shufei Zhang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy data has become essential for adapting deep learning models to real-world applications. Traditional methods often involve first evaluating the noise and then applying strategies such as discarding noisy samples, re-weighting, or re-labeling. However, these methods can fall into a vicious cycle when the initial noise evaluation is inaccurate, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages dataset distillation for noise removal. This method avoids the feedback loop common in existing techniques and enhances training efficiency, while also providing strong privacy protection through offline processing. We rigorously evaluate three representative dataset distillation methods (DATM, DANCE, and RCIG) under various noise conditions, including symmetric noise, asymmetric noise, and real-world natural noise. Our empirical findings reveal that dataset distillation effectively serves as a denoising tool in random noise scenarios but may struggle with structured asymmetric noise patterns, which can be absorbed into the distilled samples. Additionally, clean but challenging samples, such as those from tail classes in imbalanced datasets, may undergo lossy compression during distillation. Despite these challenges, our results highlight that dataset distillation holds significant promise for robust model training, especially in high-privacy environments where noise is prevalent.

<p>Abstract: Underwater imagery often suffers from severe degradation that results in low visual quality and object detection performance. This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their impact on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we selected representative underwater image enhancement models covering major enhancement categories and applied them separately to two recent datasets: 1) the Real-World Underwater Object Detection Dataset (RUOD), and 2) the Challenging Underwater Plant Detection Dataset (CUPDD). Following this, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on the enhanced images and developed a quality index (Q-index) to compare the quality distribution of the original and enhanced images. Subsequently, we compared the performance of several YOLO-NAS detection models that are separately trained and tested on the original and enhanced image sets. Then, we performed a correlation study to examine the relationship between enhancement metrics and detection performance. We also analyzed the inference results from the trained detectors presenting cases where enhancement increased the detection performance as well as cases where enhancement revealed missed objects by human annotators. This study suggests that although enhancement generally deteriorates the detection performance, it can still be harnessed in some cases for increased detection performance and more accurate human annotation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Guo, Heng Wang, Jianbo Ma, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. This is to our knowledge the first work to address V2A generation at the sound-source level. Extensive experiments show that SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our SSV2A generation can be tried and heard at https://ssv2a.github.io/SSV2A-demo .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buddhadev Goswami, Adithya B. Somaraj, Prantar Chakrabarti, Ravindra Gudi, Nirmal Punjabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Hematological disorders, which involve a variety of malignant conditions and genetic diseases affecting blood formation, present significant diagnostic challenges. One such major challenge in clinical settings is differentiating Erythroblast from WBCs. Our approach evaluates the efficacy of various machine learning (ML) classifiers$\unicode{x2014}$SVM, XG-Boost, KNN, and Random Forest$\unicode{x2014}$using the ResNet-50 deep learning model as a backbone in detecting and differentiating erythroblast blood smear images across training splits of different sizes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet50-SVM classifier consistently surpasses other models' overall test accuracy and erythroblast detection accuracy, maintaining high performance even with minimal training data. Even when trained on just 1% (168 images per class for eight classes) of the complete dataset, ML classifiers such as SVM achieved a test accuracy of 86.75% and an erythroblast precision of 98.9%, compared to 82.03% and 98.6% of pre-trained ResNet-50 models without any classifiers. When limited data is available, the proposed approach outperforms traditional deep learning models, thereby offering a solution for achieving higher classification accuracy for small and unique datasets, especially in resource-scarce settings.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15872">Optimizing Brain Tumor Segmentation with MedNeXt: BraTS 2024 SSA and Pediatrics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarim Hashmi, Juan Lugo, Abdelrahman Elsayed, Dinesh Saggurthi, Mohammed Elseiagy, Alikhan Nurkamal, Jaskaran Walia, Fadillah Adamsyah Maani, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying key pathological features in brain MRIs is crucial for the long-term survival of glioma patients. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming, requiring expert intervention and is susceptible to human error. Therefore, significant research has been devoted to developing machine learning methods that can accurately segment tumors in 3D multimodal brain MRI scans. Despite their progress, state-of-the-art models are often limited by the data they are trained on, raising concerns about their reliability when applied to diverse populations that may introduce distribution shifts. Such shifts can stem from lower quality MRI technology (e.g., in sub-Saharan Africa) or variations in patient demographics (e.g., children). The BraTS-2024 challenge provides a platform to address these issues. This study presents our methodology for segmenting tumors in the BraTS-2024 SSA and Pediatric Tumors tasks using MedNeXt, comprehensive model ensembling, and thorough postprocessing. Our approach demonstrated strong performance on the unseen validation set, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.896 on the BraTS-2024 SSA dataset and an average DSC of 0.830 on the BraTS Pediatric Tumor dataset. Additionally, our method achieved an average Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 14.682 on the BraTS-2024 SSA dataset and an average HD95 of 37.508 on the BraTS Pediatric dataset.
