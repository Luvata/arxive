<p><b>Authors:</b> Mo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), severely hampering the diagnosis of lumen stenosis. While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longwei Wang, Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin, KC Santosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\%, 76\%, and 62\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jichao Zhu, Jun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions through three modes: language, vision, and audio. Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task. They also lacked robust generalization capabilities across diverse textual model features, thus limiting performance in multimodal scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, experimental results demonstrate the MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02415">Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multi-channel and Symmetric Mutual Promotion Feature Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyuan Zhu, Jun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is a key technology in the fields of human-computer interaction and affective computing. Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenting Lu, Didi Zhu, Tao Shen, Donglin Zhu, Ayong Ye, Chao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: We introduce NitroGen, a vision-action foundation model for generalist gaming agents that is trained on 40,000 hours of gameplay videos across more than 1,000 games. We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Wang, Zuoyuan Zhang, Xiaoyi Pang, Qile Zhang, Xuanyi Hao, Shuguo Zhuo, Peng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02441">Understanding Pure Textual Reasoning for Blind Image Quality Assessment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Li, Shin'ya Nishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02443">Evaluating the Diagnostic Classification Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Insights from the Osteoarthritis Initiative</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Wang, Xi Chen, XiangWen Deng, HuaHui Yi, ZeKun Jiang, Kang Li, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445">A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Parashjyoti Borah, Sanghamitra Sarkar, Ranjan Phukan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02447">Don&#x27;t Mind the Gaps: Implicit Neural Representations for Resolution-Agnostic Retinal OCT Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bennet Kahrs, Julia Andresen, Fenja Falta, Monty Santarossa, Heinz Handels, Timo Kepp</p>
<p>Abstract: Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02457">PatchAlign3D: Local Feature Alignment for Dense 3D Shape understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Souhail Hadgi, Bingchen Gong, Ramana Sundararaman, Emery Pierson, Lei Li, Peter Wonka, Maks Ovsjanikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Current foundation models for 3D shapes excel at global tasks (retrieval, classification) but transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning. Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirreza Parvahan, Mohammad Hoseyni, Javad Khoramdel, Amirhossein Nikoofard</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaden Shaar, Bradon Thymes, Sirawut Chaixanien, Claire Cardie, Bharath Hariharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding real-world videos such as movies requires integrating visual and dialogue cues to answer complex questions. Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary "facts" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbin Zhang, Hamid Reza Tohidypour, Yixiao Wang, Panos Nasiopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Image manipulation localization is a critical research task, given that forged images may have a significant societal impact of various aspects. Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniruddha Mahapatra, Long Mai, Cusuh Ham, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuman He, Xiehua Li, Xioaju Yang, Yang Xiong, Keqin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyeon Kim, Youngju Na, Jumin Lee, Minhyuk Sung, Sung-Eui Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is a challenging problem, due to inherent pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, often requiring category-specific parametric templates. We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, significantly advancing motion transfer in varied object categories and casual video scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoquan Zheng, Jie Hao, Huiyu Duan, Yongming Han, Liang Yuan, Dong Zhang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable 3D mesh saliency ground truth (GT) is essential for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality (VR). However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longzhen Li, Guang Li, Ren Togo, Keisuke Maeda, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchang Zhong, Xu Cao, Jinke Feng, Hao Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiao Wen, Zhen Yang, Xianjie Bao, Lei Zhang, Xiantai Xiang, Wenshuai Li, Yuhan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting tiny objects plays a vital role in remote sensing intelligent interpretation, as these objects often carry critical information for downstream applications. However, due to the extremely limited pixel information and significant variations in object density, mainstream Transformer-based detectors often suffer from slow convergence and inaccurate query-object matching. To address these challenges, we propose D$^3$R-DETR, a novel DETR-based detector with Dual-Domain Density Refinement. By fusing spatial and frequency domain information, our method refines low-level feature maps and utilizes their rich details to predict more accurate object density map, thereby guiding the model to precisely localize tiny objects. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset demonstrate that D$^3$R-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art detectors for tiny object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungtae Lim, Minkyun Seo, Luca Carlone, Jaesik Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains. Code: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/BUFFER-X.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Ren, Zeyu Zhang, Wukai Li, Qingxiang Liu, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to recover the depth information of 3D scenes from 2D images. Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy. This work highlights the importance of balancing model design and data quality for achieving efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/AnyDepth.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Huan Zhang, Guoli Wang, Qian Zhang, Lefei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyu Chang, Qi Wang, Xi Guo, Zhixiong Nan, Yazhou Yao, Tianfei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to "imagine" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Earth vision has achieved milestones in geospatial object recognition but lacks exploration in object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Textile IR, a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects manufacturing-valid CAD, physics-based simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design. Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements. Key contribution: a formal representation that makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential -- enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping.</p>

<p>Abstract: Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhou Jiang, Jiaying Zhou, Nan Zeng, Mickael Li, Qijie Tang, Chao He, Huazhu Fu, Honghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides crucial molecular characterization of tissue samples and plays an indispensable role in the clinical examination and diagnosis of cancers. However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Zhang, Dongzhan Zhou, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.</p>

Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuteng Liu, Duanni Meng, Maoxun Yuan, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob L{\o}nborg Christensen, Morten Rieger Hannemose, Anders Bjorholm Dahl, Vedrana Andersen Dahl</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Yuan Cheng, Kai-Po Chang, Chi-Pin Huang, Fu-En Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqiang Liang, Jianyi Wang, Zhonghua Wu, Shangchen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aihua Zheng, Ya Gao, Shihao Li, Chenglong Li, Jin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I\~naki Erregue, Kamal Nasrollahi, Sergio Escalera</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Asif Hossain, G M Mota-Tahrin Tayef, Nabil Subhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual inspections for solar panel systems are a tedious, costly, and error-prone task, making it desirable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based monitoring. Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce and digital fashion, image-based virtual try-on (VTON) has attracted increasing attention. However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.</p>

To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we present ULS+, an enhanced version of the Universal Lesion Segmentation (ULS) model. The original ULS model segments lesions across the whole body in CT scans given volumes of interest (VOIs) centered around a click-point. Since its release, several new public datasets have become available that can further improve model performance. ULS+ incorporates these additional datasets and uses smaller input image sizes, resulting in higher accuracy and faster inference.
  We compared ULS and ULS+ using the Dice score and robustness to click-point location on the ULS23 Challenge test data and a subset of the Longitudinal-CT dataset. In all comparisons, ULS+ significantly outperformed ULS. Additionally, ULS+ ranks first on the ULS23 Challenge test-phase leaderboard. By maintaining a cycle of data-driven updates and clinical validation, ULS+ establishes a foundation for robust and clinically relevant lesion segmentation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengcheng Feng, Haojie Yin, Yucheng Jin, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Wang, Boqi Li, Hang Chen, Xingjian Wu, Yichen Wang, Jiewen Tan, Xinyu Zhang, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Wei, Shenghai Yuan, Tianchen Deng, Boyang Lou, Enwen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Kashefi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhang, Yanwei Wang, Fang Li, Hongjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Lyu, Quan Liu, Feng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yankai Jiang, Qiaoru Li, Binlu Xu, Haoran Sun, Chao Ding, Junting Dong, Yuxiang Cai, Xuhong Zhang, Jianwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Wang, Jiaojiao Zhao, Qilong Wang, Yongfeng Dong, Wenlong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wu, Thanet Markchom</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for stylised cartoon imagery presents challenges, such as interpreting exaggerated visual abstraction and narrative-driven context, which are not adequately addressed by standard large language models (LLMs) trained on natural images. To investigate this issue, a multi-agent LLM framework is introduced, specifically designed for VQA tasks in cartoon imagery. The proposed architecture consists of three specialised agents: visual agent, language agent and critic agent, which work collaboratively to support structured reasoning by integrating visual cues and narrative context. The framework was systematically evaluated on two cartoon-based VQA datasets: Pororo and Simpsons. Experimental results provide a detailed analysis of how each agent contributes to the final prediction, offering a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behaviour in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bias remains a major barrier to the clinical adoption of AI in dermatology, as diagnostic models underperform on darker skin tones. We present LesionTABE, a fairness-centric framework that couples adversarial debiasing with dermatology-specific foundation model embeddings. Evaluated across multiple datasets covering both malignant and inflammatory conditions, LesionTABE achieves over a 25\% improvement in fairness metrics compared to a ResNet-152 baseline, outperforming existing debiasing methods while simultaneously enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Lin, Sanbao Su, Rachel Luo, Yuxiao Chen, Yan Wang, Marco Pavone, Fei Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B. M. Shahria Alam, Md. Nasim Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Plant disease diagnosis is essential to farmers' management choices because plant diseases frequently lower crop yield and product quality. For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception. Xception shows a promising result of 96.23% accuracy, which is remarkable than InceptionV3. Adversarial Training is used for robustness, along with more transparency. Grad-CAM is integrated to confirm the leaf disease. Finally deployed a web application using Streamlit with a heatmap visualization and prediction with confidence level for robust grape leaf disease classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sashuai Zhou, Qiang Zhou, Jijin Hu, Hanqing Yang, Yue Cao, Junpeng Ma, Yinchao Ma, Jun Song, Tiezheng Ge, Cheng Yu, Bo Zheng, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun jiao, Haowei Zhu, Puyuan Yang, Jianghui Wang, Ji Liu, Ziqiong Liu, Dong Li, Yuejian Fang, Junhai Yong, Bin Wang, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anees Ur Rehman Hashmi, Numan Saeed, Christoph Lippert</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyan Han, Zhen Fang, XinYu Sun, Yuchen Ma, Ziheng Wang, Yu Zeng, Zehui Chen, Lin Chen, Wenxuan Huang, Wei-Jie Xu, Yi Cao, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daoan Zhang, Wenlin Yao, Xiaoyang Wang, Yebowen Hu, Jiebo Luo, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

<p>Abstract: Background: Deep learning superresolution (SR) may enhance musculoskeletal MR image quality, but its diagnostic value in knee imaging at 7T is unclear. Objectives: To compare image quality and diagnostic performance of SR, low-resolution (LR), and high-resolution (HR) 7T knee MRI. Methods: In this prospective study, 42 participants underwent 7T knee MRI with LR (0.8*0.8*2 mm3) and HR (0.4*0.4*2 mm3) sequences. SR images were generated from LR data using a Hybrid Attention Transformer model. Three radiologists assessed image quality, anatomic conspicuity, and detection of knee pathologies. Arthroscopy served as reference in 10 cases. Results: SR images showed higher overall quality than LR (median score 5 vs 4, P<.001) and lower noise than HR (5 vs 4, P<.001). Visibility of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments was superior in SR and HR compared to LR (P<.001). Detection rates and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for intra-articular pathology were similar across image types (P>=.095). Conclusions: Deep learning superresolution improved subjective image quality in 7T knee MRI but did not increase diagnostic accuracy compared with standard LR imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose: Annotation of medical breast images is an essential step toward better diagnostic but a time consuming task. This research aims to focus on different selecting sample strategies within deep active learning on Breast Region Segmentation (BRS) to lessen computational cost of training and effective use of resources.
  Methods: The Stavanger breast MRI dataset containing 59 patients was used in this study, with FCN-ResNet50 adopted as a sustainable deep learning (DL) model. A novel sample selection approach based on Breast Anatomy Geometry (BAG) analysis was introduced to group data with similar informative features for DL. Patient positioning and Breast Size were considered the key selection criteria in this process. Four selection strategies including Random Selection, Nearest Point, Breast Size, and a hybrid of all three strategies were evaluated using an active learning framework. Four training data proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were used for model training, with the remaining data reserved for testing. Model performance was assessed using Dice score, Intersection over Union, precision, and recall, along with 5-fold cross-validation to enhance generalizability.
  Results: Increasing the training data proportion from 10% to 40% improved segmentation performance for nearly all strategies, except for Random Selection. The Nearest Point strategy consistently achieved the lowest carbon footprint at 30% and 40% data proportions. Overall, combining the Nearest Point strategy with 30% of the training data provided the best balance between segmentation performance, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linfeng Ye, Zhixiang Chi, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, En-hui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</p>

Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Iterative Quantization (ITQ), Kernel-based Supervised Hashing (KSH), and Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH) on the ODIR dataset using deep feature embeddings. Experimental results show that SDH achieved the best performance, with an mAP@100 of 0.9184 using only 32-bit codes, outperforming LSH, ITQ, and KSH. Compared with prior studies, our method proved highly competitive: Fang et al. reported 0.7528 (Fundus-iSee, 48 bits) and 0.8856 (ASOCT-Cataract, 48 bits), while Wijesinghe et al. achieved 94.01 (KVASIR, 256 bits). Despite using significantly fewer bits, our SDH-based framework reached retrieval accuracy close to the state-of-the-art. These findings demonstrate that SDH is the most effective approach among those tested, offering a practical balance of accuracy, storage, and efficiency for medical image retrieval and device inventory management.</p>

To overcome the historical shortcomings of EBMs, we introduce a fast distillation strategy to transfer the strengths of pre-trained diffusion models into multi-scale EBMs. These distilled EBMs enable efficient sampling and preserve the interpretability and compositionality inherent to potential-based frameworks. Leveraging EBM compositionality, we propose Annealed Langevin Posterior Sampling (ALPS) algorithm for Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), and uncertainty estimates for inverse problems in imaging. Unlike diffusion models that use complex guidance strategies for latent variables, we perform annealing on static posterior distributions that are well-defined and composable. Experiments on image inpainting and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, while also supporting MAP recovery. Overall, our framework offers a scalable and principled solution for inverse problems in imaging, with potential for practical deployment in scientific and clinical settings. ALPS code is available at the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/JyoChand/ALPS}{ALPS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzheng Zhang, Kazuki Adachi, Yoshitaka Hara, Sousuke Nakamura</p>
<p>Abstract: Loop closure is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and consistency of visual SLAM. We propose a method to improve loop closure performance in DPV-SLAM. Our approach integrates AnyLoc, a learning-based visual place recognition technique, as a replacement for the classical Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) loop detection method. In contrast to BoVW, which relies on handcrafted features, AnyLoc utilizes deep feature representations, enabling more robust image retrieval across diverse viewpoints and lighting conditions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity threshold based on environmental conditions, removing the need for manual tuning. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the original DPV-SLAM in terms of loop closure accuracy and robustness. The proposed method offers a practical and scalable solution for enhancing loop closure performance in modern SLAM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusheng Dai, Zehua Chen, Yuxuan Jiang, Baolong Gao, Qiuhong Ke, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a unified model integrating video-to-audio (V2A), text-to-audio (T2A), and joint video-text-to-audio (VT2A) generation offers significant application flexibility, yet faces two unexplored foundational challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality audio captions with tight A-V-T alignment, leading to severe semantic conflict between multimodal conditions, and (2) cross-task and intra-task competition, manifesting as an adverse V2A-T2A performance trade-off and modality bias in the VT2A task. First, to address data scarcity, we introduce SoundAtlas, a large-scale dataset (470k pairs) that significantly outperforms existing benchmarks and even human experts in quality. Powered by a novel agentic pipeline, it integrates Vision-to-Language Compression to mitigate visual bias of MLLMs, a Junior-Senior Agent Handoff for a 5 times cost reduction, and rigorous Post-hoc Filtering to ensure fidelity. Consequently, SoundAtlas delivers semantically rich and temporally detailed captions with tight V-A-T alignment. Second, we propose Omni2Sound, a unified VT2A diffusion model supporting flexible input modalities. To resolve the inherent cross-task and intra-task competition, we design a three-stage multi-task progressive training schedule that converts cross-task competition into joint optimization and mitigates modality bias in the VT2A task, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and off-screen audio generation faithfulness. Finally, we construct VGGSound-Omni, a comprehensive benchmark for unified evaluation, including challenging off-screen tracks. With a standard DiT backbone, Omni2Sound achieves unified SOTA performance across all three tasks within a single model, demonstrating strong generalization across benchmarks with heterogeneous input conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shovini Guha, Dwaipayan Nandi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and automated lesion segmentation in Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging is essential for cancer diagnosis and therapy planning. This paper presents a Swin Transformer UNet 3D (SwinUNet3D) framework for lesion segmentation in Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans. By combining shifted window self-attention with U-Net style skip connections, the model captures both global context and fine anatomical detail. We evaluate SwinUNet3D on the AutoPET III FDG dataset and compare it against a baseline 3D U-Net. Results show that SwinUNet3D achieves a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.78, surpassing 3D U-Net (Dice 0.48, IoU 0.32) while also delivering faster inference times. Qualitative analysis demonstrates improved detection of small and irregular lesions, reduced false positives, and more accurate PET/CT fusion. While the framework is currently limited to FDG scans and trained under modest GPU resources, it establishes a strong foundation for future multi-tracer, multi-center evaluations and benchmarking against other transformer-based architectures. Overall, SwinUNet3D represents an efficient and robust approach to PET/CT lesion segmentation, advancing the integration of transformer-based models into oncology imaging workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phat Tran, Phuoc Pham, Hung Trinh, Tho Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: Bahnar, a minority language spoken across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, faces significant preservation challenges due to limited research and data availability. This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%. This work contributes valuable resources for Bahnar language preservation and provides a framework applicable to other minority language digitization efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waleed Khalid, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailin Tan, Jincheng Dai, Sixian Wang, Guo Lu, Shuo Shao, Kai Niu, Wenjun Zhang, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative joint source-channel coding (GJSCC) has emerged as a new Deep JSCC paradigm for achieving high-fidelity and robust image transmission under extreme wireless channel conditions, such as ultra-low bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio. Recent studies commonly adopt diffusion models as generative decoders, but they frequently produce visually realistic results with limited semantic consistency. This limitation stems from a fundamental mismatch between reconstruction-oriented JSCC encoders and generative decoders, as the former lack explicit semantic discriminability and fail to provide reliable conditional cues. In this paper, we propose DiT-JSCC, a novel GJSCC backbone that can jointly learn a semantics-prioritized representation encoder and a diffusion transformer (DiT) based generative decoder, our open-source project aims to promote the future research in GJSCC. Specifically, we design a semantics-detail dual-branch encoder that aligns naturally with a coarse-to-fine conditional DiT decoder, prioritizing semantic consistency under extreme channel conditions. Moreover, a training-free adaptive bandwidth allocation strategy inspired by Kolmogorov complexity is introduced to further improve the transmission efficiency, thereby indeed redefining the notion of information value in the era of generative decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiT-JSCC consistently outperforms existing JSCC methods in both semantic consistency and visual quality, particularly in extreme regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>
<p>Abstract: Do transformers learn like brains? A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially "trained" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are recognized as a transformative breakthrough that has started to reshape the future of artificial intelligence (AI) across both academia and industry. The integration of FMs into wireless networks is expected to enable the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of handling diverse network management requests and highly complex wireless-related tasks involving multi-modal data. Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks. We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks. Then, we explain how FMs can be applied to prediction and control tasks, respectively. Following this, we introduce the development of wireless-specific FMs from two perspectives: available datasets for development and the methodologies used. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges and future directions for FM-enhanced wireless networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intraoral 3D scanning is now widely adopted in modern dentistry and plays a central role in supporting key tasks such as tooth segmentation, detection, labeling, and dental landmark identification. Accurate analysis of these scans is essential for orthodontic and restorative treatment planning, as it enables automated workflows and minimizes the need for manual intervention. However, the development of robust learning-based solutions remains challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality public datasets and standardized benchmarks. This article presents Teeth3DS+, an extended public benchmark dedicated to intraoral 3D scan analysis. Developed in the context of the MICCAI 3DTeethSeg and 3DTeethLand challenges, Teeth3DS+ supports multiple fundamental tasks, including tooth detection, segmentation, labeling, 3D modeling, and dental landmark identification. The dataset consists of rigorously curated intraoral scans acquired using state-of-the-art scanners and validated by experienced orthodontists and dental surgeons. In addition to the data, Teeth3DS+ provides standardized data splits and evaluation protocols to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods, with the goal of fostering progress in learning-based analysis of 3D dental scans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang Li, Peng Yun, Yang Xu, Ye Zhang, Mingjian Sun, Qijun Chen, Ilin Alexander, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-fusion networks have shown significant promise for RGB-thermal scene parsing. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on symmetric duplex encoders for heterogeneous feature extraction and fusion, paying inadequate attention to the inherent differences between RGB and thermal modalities. Recent progress in vision foundation models (VFMs) trained through self-supervision on vast amounts of unlabeled data has proven their ability to extract informative, general-purpose features. However, this potential has yet to be fully leveraged in the domain. In this study, we take one step toward this new research area by exploring a feasible strategy to fully exploit VFM features for RGB-thermal scene parsing. Specifically, we delve deeper into the unique characteristics of RGB and thermal modalities, thereby designing a hybrid, asymmetric encoder that incorporates both a VFM and a convolutional neural network. This design allows for more effective extraction of complementary heterogeneous features, which are subsequently fused in a dual-path, progressive manner. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary task to further enrich the local semantics of the fused features, thereby improving the overall performance of RGB-thermal scene parsing. Our proposed HAPNet, equipped with all these components, demonstrates superior performance compared to all other state-of-the-art RGB-thermal scene parsing networks, achieving top ranks across three widely used public RGB-thermal scene parsing datasets. We believe this new paradigm has opened up new opportunities for future developments in data-fusion scene parsing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Verma, Royi Rassin, Arnav Das, Gantavya Bhatt, Preethi Seshadri, Chirag Shah, Jeff Bilmes, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Yanai Elazar</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models are trained using large datasets of image-text pairs collected from the internet. These datasets often include copyrighted and private images. Training models on such datasets enables them to generate images that might violate copyright laws and individual privacy. This phenomenon is termed imitation -- generation of images with content that has recognizable similarity to its training images. In this work we estimate the point at which a model was trained on enough instances of a concept to be able to imitate it -- the imitation threshold. We posit this question as a new problem and propose an efficient approach that estimates the imitation threshold without incurring the colossal cost of training these models from scratch. We experiment with two domains -- human faces and art styles, and evaluate four text-to-image models that were trained on three pretraining datasets. We estimate the imitation threshold of these models to be in the range of 200-700 images, depending on the domain and the model. The imitation threshold provides an empirical basis for copyright violation claims and acts as a guiding principle for text-to-image model developers that aim to comply with copyright and privacy laws.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghyeon Moon, Haein Kong, Muhammad Haris Khan, Mubbasir Kapadia, Yuewei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment the target object in a query image using only a small set of support images and masks. Therefore, having strong prior information for the target object using the support set is essential for guiding the initial training of FSS, which leads to the success of few-shot segmentation in challenging cases, such as when the target object shows considerable variation in appearance, texture, or scale across the support and query images. Previous methods have tried to obtain prior information by creating correlation maps from pixel-level correlation on final-layer or same-layer features. However, we found these approaches can offer limited and partial information when advanced models like Vision Transformers are used as the backbone. Vision Transformer encoders have a multi-layer structure with identical shapes in their intermediate layers. Leveraging the feature comparison from all layers in the encoder can enhance the performance of few-shot segmentation. We introduce FCC (Fully Connected Correlation) to integrate pixel-level correlations between support and query features, capturing associations that reveal target-specific patterns and correspondences in both same-layers and cross-layers. FCC captures previously inaccessible target information, effectively addressing the limitations of support mask. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL, COCO, and domain shift tests. We conducted an ablation study and cross-layer correlation analysis to validate FCC's core methodology. These findings reveal the effectiveness of FCC in enhancing prior information and overall model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structuring latent representations in a hierarchical manner enables models to learn patterns at multiple levels of abstraction. However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Language Navigation is a task that challenges robots to navigate in realistic environments based on natural language instructions. While previous research has largely focused on static settings, real-world navigation must often contend with dynamic human obstacles. Hence, we propose an extension to the task, termed Adaptive Visual Language Navigation (AdaVLN), which seeks to narrow this gap. AdaVLN requires robots to navigate complex 3D indoor environments populated with dynamically moving human obstacles, adding a layer of complexity to navigation tasks that mimic the real-world. To support exploration of this task, we also present AdaVLN simulator and AdaR2R datasets. The AdaVLN simulator enables easy inclusion of fully animated human models directly into common datasets like Matterport3D. We also introduce a "freeze-time" mechanism for both the navigation task and simulator, which pauses world state updates during agent inference, enabling fair comparisons and experimental reproducibility across different hardware. We evaluate several baseline models on this task, analyze the unique challenges introduced by AdaVLN, and demonstrate its potential to bridge the sim-to-real gap in VLN research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian SLAM systems excel in real-time rendering and fine-grained reconstruction compared to NeRF-based systems. However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geolocation, the task of identifying an image's location, requires complex reasoning and is crucial for navigation, monitoring, and cultural preservation. However, current methods often produce coarse, imprecise, and non-interpretable localization. A major challenge lies in the quality and scale of existing geolocation datasets. These datasets are typically small-scale and automatically constructed, leading to noisy data and inconsistent task difficulty, with images that either reveal answers too easily or lack sufficient clues for reliable inference. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive geolocation framework with three key components: GeoComp, a large-scale dataset; GeoCoT, a novel reasoning method; and GeoEval, an evaluation metric, collectively designed to address critical challenges and drive advancements in geolocation research. At the core of this framework is GeoComp (Geolocation Competition Dataset), a large-scale dataset collected from a geolocation game platform involving 740K users over two years. It comprises 25 million entries of metadata and 3 million geo-tagged locations spanning much of the globe, with each location annotated thousands to tens of thousands of times by human users. The dataset offers diverse difficulty levels for detailed analysis and highlights key gaps in current models. Building on this dataset, we propose Geographical Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT), a novel multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision Models (LVMs) in geolocation tasks. GeoCoT improves performance by integrating contextual and spatial cues through a multi-step process that mimics human geolocation reasoning. Finally, using the GeoEval metric, we demonstrate that GeoCoT significantly boosts geolocation accuracy by up to 25% while enhancing interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research endeavors have been made in learning robust Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) against jailbreak attacks. However, existing methods for improving MLLMs' robustness still face critical challenges: \ding{172} how to efficiently tune massive weight parameters and \ding{173} how to ensure robustness against attacks across both visual and textual modalities. To this end, we propose an \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{E}nd-to-end \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{T}raining (E$^2$AT) framework for both visual and textual adversarial attacks. Specifically, for the visual aspect, E$^2$AT incorporates an efficient projector-based AT module that aligns the attack samples at the feature level. For training objectives, we propose a Dynamic Joint Multimodal Optimization (DJMO) strategy to enhance generalization ability against jailbreak attacks by dynamically adjusting weights between normal and adversarial objectives. Extensive experiments are conducted with five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs. Results demonstrate that our E$^2$AT achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of 34\% across text and image modalities, while maintaining clean task performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomoki Ichikawa, Ryo Kawahara, Ko Nishino</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for joint sensing of shape and reflectance of a static or dynamic deformable object, which is also invisible to the naked eye. Past structured-light methods are limited to shape acquisition and cannot recover reflectance as they alter scene appearance. Our key idea is to spatially multiplex a polarization pattern to encode the incident ray and also densely sample the reflected light. We derive a quantized polarized light pattern that can be robustly and uniquely decoded from the reflected Angle of Linear Polarization (AoLP) values. It also enables single-shot disentanglement of polarimetric diffuse and specular reflections for accurate BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. We validate this novel invisible single-shot shape and reflectance method with real static and dynamic objects. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPM for accurate shape and BRDF measurement which opens new avenues of application for 3D sensing thanks to its invisibility and ability to jointly recover the radiometric properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Fang, Yalin Feng, Chunyu Sui, Hongbin Zhong, Hongwei Yi, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID Glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. This paper proposes SignX, a novel framework for continuous sign language recognition in compact pose-rich latent space. First, we construct a unified latent representation that encodes heterogeneous pose formats (SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation) into a compact, information-dense space. Second, we train a ViT-based Video2Pose module to extract this latent representation directly from raw videos. Finally, we develop a temporal modeling and sequence refinement method that operates entirely in this latent space. This multi-stage design achieves end-to-end sign language recognition while significantly reducing computational consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that SignX achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on continuous sign language recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaochu Wang, Chufeng Xiao, Manfred Lau, Hongbo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods to understand and model hand-object interactions (HOI) require a large amount of high-quality HOI data. One way to create HOI data is to transfer hand poses from a source object to another based on the objects' geometry. However, current methods for transferring hand poses between objects rely on shape matching, limiting the ability to transfer poses across different categories due to differences in their shapes and sizes. We observe that HOI often involves specific semantic parts of objects, which often have more consistent shapes across categories. In addition, constructing size-invariant correspondences between these parts is important for cross-category transfer. Based on these insights, we introduce a novel method PartHOI for part-based HOI transfer. Using a generalized cylinder representation to parameterize an object parts' geometry, PartHOI establishes a robust geometric correspondence between object parts, and enables the transfer of contact points. Given the transferred points, we optimize a hand pose to fit the target object well. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method can generalize HOI transfers well even for cross-category objects, and produce high-fidelity results that are superior to the existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Wu, Yixin Wan, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (T2I retrieval) remains challenging because cross-modal embeddings often behave as bags of concepts, underrepresenting structured visual relationships such as pose and viewpoint. We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a retrieval paradigm that mitigates this limitation of cross-modal similarity alignment. VisRet first projects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation, then performs retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Across four benchmarks (Visual-RAG, INQUIRE-Rerank, Microsoft COCO, and our new Visual-RAG-ME featuring multi-entity comparisons), VisRet substantially outperforms cross-modal similarity matching and baselines that recast T2I retrieval as text-to-text similarity matching, improving nDCG@30 by 0.125 on average with CLIP as the retriever and by 0.121 with E5-V. For downstream question answering, VisRet increases accuracy on Visual-RAG and Visual-RAG-ME by 3.8% and 15.7% in top-1 retrieval, and by 3.9% and 11.1% in top-10 retrieval. Ablation studies show compatibility with different T2I instruction LLMs, T2I generation models, and downstream LLMs. VisRet provides a simple yet effective perspective for advancing in text-image retrieval.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liu Liu, Xiaofeng Wang, Guosheng Zhao, Keyu Li, Wenkang Qin, Jiagang Zhu, Jiaxiong Qiu, Zheng Zhu, Guan Huang, Zhizhong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of general-purpose robotics is to create agents that can seamlessly adapt to and operate in diverse, unstructured human environments. Imitation learning has become a key paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet collecting large-scale and diverse demonstrations is prohibitively expensive. Simulators provide a cost-effective alternative, but the sim-to-real gap remains a major obstacle to scalability. We present RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for synthesizing robotic data. By leveraging cross-view feature interactions and globally consistent 3D geometry, RoboTransfer ensures multi-view geometric consistency while enabling fine-grained control over scene elements, such as background editing and object replacement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer produces videos with superior geometric consistency and visual fidelity. Furthermore, policies trained on this synthetic data exhibit enhanced generalization to novel, unseen scenarios. Project page: https://horizonrobotics.github.io/robot_lab/robotransfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Yu (Eric),  Qian, Wilson S. Geisler, Xue-Xin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have compared neural activities in the visual cortex to representations in deep neural networks trained on image classification. Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal training and performance addressing key questions related to data representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We show how to tokenize complex 3D objects to incorporate into our structured 3D scene modality. We evaluate performance across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We show our model's effectiveness on reconstructing complete 3D scenes consisting of complex objects from a single image and on real-world 3D object recognition tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lavoie, Michael Noukhovitch, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiquan Wen, Tianxiao Li, Zhenglin Huang, Yiwei He, Guangliang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a framework for unified detection and explanation of synthetic image and video, with a direct reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a unified benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Sun, Quanyun Wu, Hanqing Xu, Kyle Gao, Zhengsen Xu, Yiping Chen, Dedong Zhang, Lingfei Ma, John S. Zelek, Jonathan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Existing segmentation approaches typically rely on high-dimensional feature lifting, which causes costly optimization, implicit semantics, and task-specific constraints. We present \textbf{Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline)}, a unified, zero-shot framework that achieves real-time, cross-view consistent segmentation without scene-specific training. SAGOnline decouples the monolithic segmentation problem into lightweight sub-tasks. By integrating video foundation models (e.g., SAM 2), we first generate temporally consistent 2D masks across rendered views. Crucially, instead of learning continuous feature fields, we introduce a \textbf{Rasterization-aware Geometric Consensus} mechanism that leverages the traceability of the Gaussian rasterization pipeline. This allows us to deterministically map 2D predictions to explicit, discrete 3D primitive labels in real-time. This discrete representation eliminates the memory and computational burden of feature distillation, enabling instant inference. Extensive evaluations on NVOS and SPIn-NeRF benchmarks demonstrate that SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (92.7\% and 95.2\% mIoU) while operating at the fastest speed at 27 ms per frame. By providing a flexible interface for diverse foundation models, our framework supports instant prompt, instance, and semantic segmentation, paving the way for interactive 3D understanding in AR/VR and robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nir Mazor, Tom Hope</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. However, multimodal retrieval-augmented diagnosis is highly challenging. We explore a lightweight mechanism for enhancing diagnostic performance of retrieval-augmented LVLMs. We train a lightweight LVLM-aware multimodal retriever, such that the retriever learns to return images and texts that guide the LVLM toward correct predictions. In our low-resource setting, we perform only lightweight fine-tuning with small amounts of data, and use only general-purpose backbone models, achieving competitive results in clinical classification and VQA tasks compared to medically pre-trained models with extensive training. In a novel analysis, we highlight a previously unexplored class of errors that we term inconsistent retrieval predictions: cases where different top-retrieved images yield different predictions for the same target. We find that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models, and that our retrieval optimization mechanism significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, our analysis also sheds light on gaps in the ability of LVLMs to utilize retrieved information for clinical predictions. Code and models available at: https://github.com/Nirmaz/JOMED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxiang Wang, Xuanyu Wang, YiJia Luo, Yongbin Yu, Manping Fan, Jingtao Zhang, Liyong Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in environmental perception. Traditional assistive technologies often lack adaptive intelligence, focusing on individual components rather than integrated systems. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to richer, integrated understanding, their deployment is severely limited by substantial computational requirements, demanding dozens of gigabytes of memory. To address these gaps in computational efficiency and integrated design, this study proposes a dual technological innovation framework: a cross-modal differentiated quantization framework for VLMs and a scene-aware vectorized memory multi-agent system. The quantization framework implements differentiated strategies, reducing memory from 38GB to 11.3GB. The multi-agent system uses vectorized memory and perception-memory-reasoning workflows to provide environmental information beyond the current view, achieving 2.83-3.52s latency to initial speech output. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering comprehensive assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their capability for spatiotemporal pattern reasoning across multiple videos remains a critical gap in pattern recognition research. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first diagnostic benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to analyze and integrate spatiotemporal patterns from dynamic visual streams. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 63.5% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91.3% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLMs architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for advancing pattern recognition methodologies in multi-video scenarios, providing architectural insights for next-generation models.

At its core, the system employs a lightweight symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly, the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift.

<p>Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic (PV) systems. While recent studies have applied deep learning to PV inspection, fair benchmarking across detector architectures and unbiased handling of class imbalance remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive benchmark of convolutional and transformer-based object detectors on UAV-captured RGB imagery of solar panels. It introduces a class-targeted augmentation strategy applied exclusively to the training split to mitigate imbalance without compromising evaluation integrity. Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 and MobileNetV3 backbones, RetinaNet with ResNet50, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and Swin Transformer backbones integrated with Faster R-CNN (Tiny, Small, and Base variants) are evaluated. Performance is assessed using mean Average Precision (mAP) across multiple IoU thresholds, precision, recall, F1 score, and inference throughput to enable accuracy-throughput tradeoff analysis relevant to UAV deployment. Experimental results show that Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone achieves the highest localization accuracy, with mAP@0.5 of 0.893 and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.759, whereas the MobileNetV3 variant provides the best overall reliability balance, achieving recall of 0.745, F1-score of 0.809, and accuracy of 0.679 on the test set.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhao Wang, Nam Ling, Wei Wang, Wei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior studies in embodied AI consistently show that robust perception is critical for human-robot interaction, yet deploying high-fidelity visual models on resource-constrained agents remains challenging due to limited on-device computation power and transmission latency. Exploiting the redundancy in latent representations could improve system efficiency, yet existing approaches often rely on costly dataset-specific ablation tests or heavy entropy models unsuitable for real-time edge-robot collaboration.
  We propose a generalizable, dataset-agnostic method to identify and selectively transmit structure-critical channels in pretrained encoders. Instead of brute-force empirical evaluations, our approach leverages intrinsic parameter statistics-weight variances and biases-to estimate channel importance. This analysis reveals a consistent organizational structure, termed the Invariant Salient Channel Space (ISCS), where Salient-Core channels capture dominant structures while Salient-Auxiliary channels encode fine visual details. Building on ISCS, we introduce a deterministic static pruning strategy that enables lightweight split-computing.
  Experiments across different datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a deterministic, ultra-low latency pipeline by bypassing heavy entropy modeling. Our method reduces end-to-end latency, providing a critical speed-accuracy trade-off for resource-constrained human-aware embodied systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Burgert, Oliver Stoll, Paolo Rota, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

Existing TTS approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3) successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jizheng Ma, Xiaofei Zhou, Yanlong Song, Han Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances logical performance by decomposing complex tasks, yet its multimodal extension faces a trade-off. The existing Thinking with Images paradigm is limited by the modality gap between vision and language, which hinders reliable extraction of reasoning relevant information from high dimensional visual data. Recent latent space reasoning method provides stronger multimodal representations, but it often lacks the ability to refocus on visual inputs and suffers from limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose \underline{La}tent \underline{Re}focusing (LaRe), a novel multimodal reasoning paradigm that combines visual refocusing with rich latent representations, enabling iterative reasoning within the latent space. We further design a semantic augmentation training strategy that enhances the semantic structure of the latent space through joint alignment and reconstruction objectives. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LaRe improves average accuracy by 9.4\% compared to existing baselines while reducing the number of tokens required for inference by 16.5\%. When scaled to a 7B-parameter Large Language Model backbone, LaRe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms larger-scale models on almost all benchmarks. Code and checkpoints will be released later.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed BBox and Index as Visual Prompt (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-15k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will release data, models, and code on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyue Zhang, Jianfang Li, Jianqiang Ren, Jiaxu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Saeed, Ramtin Gharleghi, Susann Beier, Sonit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Wang, Chong-Wah Ngo, Ee-Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of learning representations for recipes and food images in the cross-modal retrieval problem. As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Deng, Hideaki Hayashi, Hajime Nagahara</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification. Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhyeong Park, Shaheryar Muhammad, Seangmin Lee, Jong Taek Lee, Soon Ki Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Current face de-identification methods that replace identifiable cues in the face region with other sacrifices utilities contributing to realism, such as age and gender. To retrieve the damaged realism, we present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a single-input face de-identification framework that directly replaces identity features in the latent space of a pretrained diffusion model without affecting the model's weights. We reinterpret face de-identification as an image editing task in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework estimates identity-editing directions through optimization guided by loss functions that encourage attribute preservation while suppressing identity signals. We further introduce both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ show that FLUID achieves a superior balance between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming existing de-identification approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaye Qian, Ge Zheng, Yuchen Zhu, Sibei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Ge, Jiuxin Cao, Xinyi Li, Xuelin Zhu, Chang Liu, Bo Liu, Chen Feng, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui-qing Sun, Xingshan Yao, Tian Lan, Jia-Ling Shi, Chen-Hao Cui, Hui-Yang Zhao, Zhijing Wu, Chen Yang, Xian-Ling Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

<p>Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-FlashTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-FlashTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunyi Zhao, Gengze Zhou, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Project website: https://darkeqa-benchmark.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92).

<p>Abstract: High-quality three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is gaining increasing attention in clinical applications. To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and in vivo mouse experiments, and the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG_Pro.</p>

<p>Abstract: First-Frame Propagation (FFP) offers a promising paradigm for controllable video editing, but existing methods are hampered by a reliance on cumbersome run-time guidance. We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift. Comprehensive experiments on the EditVerseBench benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforming existing academic and commercial models by receiving about 0.2 PickScore and 0.3 VLM score improvement against these competitors.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning approach for Mpox diagnosis named Customized Residual SwinTransformerV2 (RSwinV2) has been proposed, trying to enhance the capability of lesion classification by employing the RSwinV2 tool-assisted vision approach. In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.51 and an F1score of 96.13 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; the RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its validity as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orthognathic surgery repositions jaw bones to restore occlusion and enhance facial aesthetics. Accurate simulation of postoperative facial morphology is essential for preoperative planning. However, traditional biomechanical models are computationally expensive, while geometric deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. In this study, we develop and validate a physics-informed geometric deep learning framework named PhysSFI-Net for precise prediction of soft tissue deformation following orthognathic surgery. PhysSFI-Net consists of three components: a hierarchical graph module with craniofacial and surgical plan encoders combined with attention mechanisms to extract skeletal-facial interaction features; a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequential predictor for incremental soft tissue deformation; and a biomechanics-inspired module for high-resolution facial surface reconstruction. Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PhysSFI-Net achieved a point cloud shape error of 1.070 +/- 0.088 mm, a surface deviation error of 1.296 +/- 0.349 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.445 +/- 1.326 mm. Comparative experiments indicated that PhysSFI-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method ACMT-Net in prediction accuracy. In conclusion, PhysSFI-Net enables interpretable, high-resolution prediction of postoperative facial morphology with superior accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical application in orthognathic surgical planning and simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehuan Cao, Fiseha Berhanu Tesema, Ping Fu, Jianfeng Ren, Ahmed Nasr</p>
<p>Abstract: Glacial segmentation is essential for reconstructing past glacier dynamics and evaluating climate-driven landscape change. However, weak optical contrast and the limited availability of high-resolution DEMs hinder automated mapping. This study introduces the first large-scale optical-only moraine segmentation dataset, comprising 3,340 manually annotated high-resolution images from Google Earth covering glaciated regions of Sichuan and Yunnan, China. We develop MCD-Net, a lightweight baseline that integrates a MobileNetV2 encoder, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and a DeepLabV3+ decoder. Benchmarking against deeper backbones (ResNet152, Xception) shows that MCD-Net achieves 62.3% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 72.8% Dice coefficient while reducing computational cost by more than 60%. Although ridge delineation remains constrained by sub-pixel width and spectral ambiguity, the results demonstrate that optical imagery alone can provide reliable moraine-body segmentation. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyra-alpha/MCD-Net, establishing a reproducible benchmark for moraine-specific segmentation and offering a deployable baseline for high-altitude glacial monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjie Chen, Kartik Patwari, Zhengfeng Lai, Xiaoguang Zhu, Sen-ching Cheung, Chen-Nee Chuah</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing SFDA methods struggle to fully use pre-trained knowledge and often rely on a single model's predictions or handcrafted prompts, limiting robustness under domain shift. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative: they encode rich visual-semantic knowledge and generalize well without task-specific tuning. However, their use in SFDA is hindered by instruction-following failures, inconsistent outputs, and high inference costs. We propose Reliability-based Curriculum Learning (RCL), a novel framework that distills robust supervision from multiple frozen MLLMs into a compact target model. RCL organizes adaptation as a three-stage curriculum that progressively incorporates pseudo-labels based on inter-model agreement and model confidence, enabling stable and noise-aware training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard SFDA datasets, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA-C, outperforming zero-shot MLLMs, their ensembles, all without accessing source data or tuning foundation models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Dong-Jie-Chen/RCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niclas F\"uhrling, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David Gonz\'alez G., Osvaldo Gonsa</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a robust and self-reliant (or "egoistic") variation of the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which a primary rigid body seeks to estimate the pose (i.e., location and orientation) of another rigid body (or "target"), relative to its own, without the assistance of external infrastructure, without prior knowledge of the shape of the target, and taking into account the possibility that the available observations are incomplete. Three complementary contributions are then offered for such a scenario. The first is a method to estimate the translation vector between the center point of both rigid bodies, which unlike existing techniques does not require that both objects have the same shape or even the same number of landmark points. This technique is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art (SotA) under complete information, but to be sensitive to data erasures, even when enhanced by matrix completion methods. The second contribution, designed to offer improved performance in the presence of incomplete information, offers a robust alternative to the latter, at the expense of a slight relative loss under complete information. Finally, the third contribution is a scheme for the estimation of the rotation matrix describing the relative orientation of the target rigid body with respect to the primary. Comparisons of the proposed schemes and SotA techniques demonstrate the advantage of the contributed methods in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) performance under fully complete information and incomplete conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woongyeong Yeo, Kangsan Kim, Soyeong Jeong, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single aggregated corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose modality-aware routing, which dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it, and further justify its effectiveness with a theoretical analysis. Moreover, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 10 benchmarks of multiple modalities, showing its superiority over various modality-specific and unified baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Zhang, Tianrun Hu, Hanbo Zhang, Yanyuan Qiao, Yuchu Qin, Yang Li, Jiajun Liu, Tao Kong, Lingqiao Liu, Xiao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hexiang Gu, Qifan Yu, Yuan Liu, Zikang Li, Saihui Hou, Jian Zhao, Zhaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: As a multimodal medium combining images and text, memes frequently convey implicit harmful content through metaphors and humor, rendering the detection of harmful memes a complex and challenging task. Although recent studies have made progress in detection accuracy and interpretability, large-scale, high-quality datasets for harmful memes remain scarce, and current methods still struggle to capture implicit risks and nuanced semantics. Thus, we construct MemeMind, a large-scale harmful meme dataset. Aligned with the international standards and the context of internet, MemeMind provides detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning annotations to support fine-grained analysis of implicit intentions in memes. Based on this dataset, we further propose MemeGuard, a reasoning-oriented multimodal detection model that significantly improves both the accuracy of harmful meme detection and the interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MemeGuard outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the MemeMind dataset, establishing a solid foundation for future research in harmful meme detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world, knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline, MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities, covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or respond.

<p>Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhen Tan, Yufan Wu, Yuxuan Liu, Haoran Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing time series in natural language, requires numeric and temporal reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on fully synthetic or generic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. We introduce \textbf{CaTS-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{a}ware \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries reasoning across $11$ diverse domains, centered on a gold-standard evaluation set of $1746$ human-rewritten captions that measure how effectively models translate numeric trends into immediately interpretable narratives. To address the scarcity of human-annotated data, we also propose a scalable pipeline for generating high-fidelity synthetic captions, the quality of which we validate. We evaluate leading Vision-Language Models on our benchmark, revealing that even proprietary models struggle to capture numeric nuances in temporal descriptions, while finetuning open-source models on synthetic data yields substantial performance gains. Finally, release a diagnostic suite of $910$ multiple-choice questions and tailored numeric metrics to gauge time-series-specific reasoning capabilities, establishing CaTS-Bench as a reliable foundation for grounded, multimodal language generation in numeric domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungwoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E < 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.
  We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.
