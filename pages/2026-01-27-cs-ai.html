<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Drones are becoming more and more popular nowadays. They are small in size, low in cost, and reliable in operation. They contain a variety of sensors and can perform a variety of flight tasks, reaching places that are difficult or inaccessible for humans. Earthquakes damage a lot of infrastructure, making it impossible for rescuers to reach some areas. But drones can help. Many amateur and professional photographers like to use drones for aerial photography. Drones play a non-negligible role in agriculture and transportation too. Drones can be used to spray pesticides, and they can also transport supplies. A quadcopter is a four-rotor drone and has been studied in this paper. In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented. The expectation maximization algorithm has been applied for parameter estimation of the quadcopter. The results of offline parameter estimation and online parameter estimation are presented. The results show that the online parameter estimation has a slightly larger range of convergence values than the offline parameter estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Judy Zhu, Dhari Gandhi, Himanshu Joshi, Ahmad Rezaie Mianroodi, Sedef Akinli Kocak, Dhanesh Ramachandran</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic systems have transformed how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to create autonomous systems with goal-directed behaviors, consisting of multi-step planning and the ability to interact with different environments. These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17188">Implementing Tensor Logic: Unifying Datalog and Neural Reasoning via Tensor Contraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Swapn Shah (School of Data Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte), Wlodek Zadrozny (Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte)</p>
<p>Abstract: The unification of symbolic reasoning and neural networks remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries. Third, we validate the Tensor Logic superposition construction on FB15k-237, a large-scale knowledge graph with 14,541 entities and 237 relations. Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Akagi, Tomohisa Seki, Hiromasa Ito, Toru Takiguchi, Kazuhiko Ohe, Yoshimasa Kawazoe</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation is a powerful tool for exploring uncertainty. Its potential in clinical medicine is transformative and includes personalized treatment planning and virtual clinical trials. However, simulating patient trajectories is challenging because of complex biological and sociocultural influences. Here, we show that real-world clinical records can be leveraged to empirically model patient timelines. We developed a generative simulator model that takes a patient's history as input and synthesizes fine-grained, realistic future trajectories. The model was pretrained on more than 200 million clinical records. It produced high-fidelity future timelines, closely matching event occurrence rates, laboratory test results, and temporal dynamics in real patient future data. It also accurately estimated future event probabilities, with observed-to-expected ratios consistently near 1.0 across diverse outcomes and time horizons. Our results reveal the untapped value of real-world data in electronic health records and introduce a scalable framework for in silico modeling of clinical care.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17311">Phase Transition for Budgeted Multi-Agent Synergy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bang Liu, Linglong Kong, Jian Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems can improve reliability, yet under a fixed inference budget they often help, saturate, or even collapse. We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $\beta$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $\gamma(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $\rho$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $\alpha_\rho$ (combining $\gamma(m)$, $\rho$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>\beta$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17332">TheoremForge: Scaling up Formal Data Synthesis with Low-Budget Agentic Workflow</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Tao, Hongteng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The high cost of agentic workflows in formal mathematics hinders large-scale data synthesis, exacerbating the scarcity of open-source corpora. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TheoremForge}, a cost-effective formal data synthesis pipeline that decomposes the formalization process into five sub-tasks, which are \textit{statement formalization}, \textit{proof generation}, \textit{premise selection}, \textit{proof correction} and \textit{proof sketching}. By implementing a \textit{Decoupled Extraction Strategy}, the workflow recovers valid training signals from globally failed trajectories, effectively utilizing wasted computation. Experiments on a 2,000-problem benchmark demonstrate that TheoremForge achieves a Verified Rate of 12.6\%, surpassing the 8.6\% baseline, at an average cost of only \textbf{\$0.481} per successful trajectory using Gemini-3-Flash. Crucially, our strategy increases data yield by \textbf{1.6$\times$} for proof generation compared to standard filtering. These results establish TheoremForge as a scalable framework for constructing a data flywheel to train future expert models.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17335">The Relativity of AGI: Distributional Axioms, Fragility, and Undecidability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Angshul Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: We study whether Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) admits a coherent theoretical definition that supports absolute claims of existence, robustness, or self-verification. We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and G\"odel--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed. Taken together, our results show that strong, distribution-independent claims of AGI are not false but undefined without explicit formal indexing, and that empirical progress in AI does not imply the attainability of self-certifying general intelligence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17343">Are We Evaluating the Edit Locality of LLM Model Editing Properly?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Haomei Xu, Hongkai Liu, Zhiying Deng, Ruixuan Li, Heng Huang, Yee Whye Teh, Wee Sun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Model editing has recently emerged as a popular paradigm for efficiently updating knowledge in LLMs. A central desideratum of updating knowledge is to balance editing efficacy, i.e., the successful injection of target knowledge, and specificity (also known as edit locality), i.e., the preservation of existing non-target knowledge. However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17346">Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning via LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Xu, Changyong Qi, Tong Liu, Bohao Zhang, Anna He, Bingqian Jiang, Longwei Zheng, Xiaoqing Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into intelligent tutoring systems offers transformative potential for personalized learning in higher education. However, most existing learning path planning approaches lack transparency, adaptability, and learner-centered explainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning (MALPP) framework that leverages a role- and rule-based collaboration mechanism among intelligent agents, each powered by LLMs. The framework includes three task-specific agents: a learner analytics agent, a path planning agent, and a reflection agent. These agents collaborate via structured prompts and predefined rules to analyze learning profiles, generate tailored learning paths, and iteratively refine them with interpretable feedback. Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development, the system ensures that recommended paths are cognitively aligned and pedagogically meaningful. Experiments conducted on the MOOCCubeX dataset using seven LLMs show that MALPP significantly outperforms baseline models in path quality, knowledge sequence consistency, and cognitive load alignment. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the collaborative mechanism and theoretical constraints. This research contributes to the development of trustworthy, explainable AI in education and demonstrates a scalable approach to learner-centered adaptive instruction powered by LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikant Panda, Sourabh Singh Yadav, Palkesh Malviya</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in socially sensitive applications, yet their behavior with respect to disability remains underexplored. We study disability aware descriptions for person centric images, where models often transition from evidence grounded factual description to interpretation shift including introduction of unsupported inferences beyond observable visual evidence. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing. These effects are further amplified along race and gender dimension. Finally, we demonstrate targeted prompting and preference fine-tuning effectively improves interpretive fidelity and reduces substantially interpretation shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqing Zang, Yuqi Ding, Yanmei Gu, Changkai Song, Zhengkai Yang, Guoping Du, Junbo Zhao, Haobo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human logic has gradually shifted from intuition-driven inference to rigorous formal systems. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we explore whether LLMs exhibit a similar evolution in the underlying logical framework. Using existential import as a probe, we for evaluate syllogism under traditional and modern logic. Through extensive experiments of testing SOTA LLMs on a new syllogism dataset, we have some interesting findings: (i) Model size scaling promotes the shift toward modern logic; (ii) Thinking serves as an efficient accelerator beyond parameter scaling; (iii) the Base model plays a crucial role in determining how easily and stably this shift can emerge. Beyond these core factors, we conduct additional experiments for in-depth analysis of properties of current LLMs on syllogistic reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Broadhurst, Tawab Safi, Joseph Edell, Vashisht Ganesh, Karime Maamari</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational AI systems require guardrails to prevent harmful outputs, yet existing approaches use static rules that cannot adapt to new threats or deployment contexts. We introduce Lattice, a framework for self-constructing and continuously improving guardrails. Lattice operates in two stages: construction builds initial guardrails from labeled examples through iterative simulation and optimization; continuous improvement autonomously adapts deployed guardrails through risk assessment, adversarial testing, and consolidation. Evaluated on the ProsocialDialog dataset, Lattice achieves 91% F1 on held-out data, outperforming keyword baselines by 43pp, LlamaGuard by 25pp, and NeMo by 4pp. The continuous improvement stage achieves 7pp F1 improvement on cross-domain data through closed-loop optimization. Our framework shows that effective guardrails can be self-constructed through iterative optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern DevOps practices have accelerated software delivery through automation, CI/CD pipelines, and observability tooling,but these approaches struggle to keep pace with the scale and dynamism of cloud-native systems. As telemetry volume grows and configuration drift increases, traditional, rule-driven automation often results in reactive operations, delayed remediation, and dependency on manual expertise. This paper introduces Cognitive Platform Engineering, a next-generation paradigm that integrates sensing, reasoning, and autonomous action directly into the platform lifecycle. This paper propose a four-plane reference architecture that unifies data collection, intelligent inference, policy-driven orchestration, and human experience layers within a continuous feedback loop. A prototype implementation built with Kubernetes, Terraform, Open Policy Agent, and ML-based anomaly detection demonstrates improvements in mean time to resolution, resource efficiency, and compliance. The results show that embedding intelligence into platform operations enables resilient, self-adjusting, and intent-aligned cloud environments. The paper concludes with research opportunities in reinforcement learning, explainable governance, and sustainable self-managing cloud ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azza Fadhel, Nathaniel W. Zuckschwerdt, Aryan Deshwal, Susmita Bose, Amit Bandyopadhyay, Jana Doppa</p>
<p>Abstract: Configuring the parameters of additive manufacturing processes for metal alloys is a challenging problem due to complex relationships between input parameters (e.g., laser power, scan speed) and quality of printed outputs. The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have reignited scientific debate over whether embodiment is necessary for intelligence. We present the argument that intelligence requires grounding, a phenomenon entailed by embodiment, but not embodiment itself. We define intelligence as the possession of four properties -- motivation, predictive ability, understanding of causality, and learning from experience -- and argue that each can be achieved by a non-embodied, grounded agent. We use this to conclude that grounding, not embodiment, is necessary for intelligence. We then present a thought experiment of an intelligent LLM agent in a digital environment and address potential counterarguments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Zhang, Liting Huang, Guanghao Wu, Preslav Nakov, Heng Ji, Usman Naseem</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models is critical for healthcare; however, reliance on binary refusal boundaries often results in \emph{over-refusal} of benign queries or \emph{unsafe compliance} with harmful ones. While existing benchmarks measure these extremes, they fail to evaluate Safe Completion: the model's ability to maximise helpfulness on dual-use or borderline queries by providing safe, high-level guidance without crossing into actionable harm. We introduce \textbf{Health-ORSC-Bench}, the first large-scale benchmark designed to systematically measure \textbf{Over-Refusal} and \textbf{Safe Completion} quality in healthcare. Comprising 31,920 benign boundary prompts across seven health categories (e.g., self-harm, medical misinformation), our framework uses an automated pipeline with human validation to test models at varying levels of intent ambiguity. We evaluate 30 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5 and Claude-4, revealing a significant tension: safety-optimised models frequently refuse up to 80\% of "Hard" benign prompts, while domain-specific models often sacrifice safety for utility. Our findings demonstrate that model family and size significantly influence calibration: larger frontier models (e.g., GPT-5, Llama-4) exhibit "safety-pessimism" and higher over-refusal than smaller or MoE-based counterparts (e.g., Qwen-3-Next), highlighting that current LLMs struggle to balance refusal and compliance. Health-ORSC-Bench provides a rigorous standard for calibrating the next generation of medical AI assistants toward nuanced, safe, and helpful completions. The code and data will be released upon acceptance. \textcolor{red}{Warning: Some contents may include toxic or undesired contents.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu An, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: We study inverse mechanism learning: recovering an unknown incentive-generating mechanism from observed strategic interaction traces of self-interested learning agents. Unlike inverse game theory and multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which typically infer utility/reward parameters inside a structured mechanism, our target includes unstructured mechanism -- a (possibly neural) mapping from joint actions to per-agent payoffs. Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harper Hua, Zhen Han, Zhengyuan Shen, Jeremy Lee, Patrick Guan, Qi Zhu, Sullam Jeoung, Yueyan Chen, Yunfei Bai, Shuai Wang, Vassilis Ioannidis, Huzefa Rangwala</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved Text-to-SQL generation, a pronounced gap remains between AI systems and human experts on challenging benchmarks such as BIRD-SQL. We argue this gap stems largely from the prevailing single-pass paradigm, which lacks the iterative reasoning, schema exploration, and error-correction behaviors that humans naturally employ. To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our 7B and 14B models outperform substantially larger proprietary systems by 5% on average, underscoring the effectiveness of interactive, agentic workflows for robust Text-to-SQL generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating data across various modalities. By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Mo, Yu Bai, Dapeng Sun, Yuqian Shi, Yukai Miao, Li Chen, Dan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled agents to operate in open-ended web and operating system environments. However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents. We release EntWorld as a rigorous testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of the next generation of enterprise-ready digital agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungho Kim, Geon Lee, Juyeon Kim, Dongwon Choi, Shinhwan Kang, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) play a crucial role in many real-world web applications, supporting data management across multiple interconnected tables. Beyond typical retrieval-oriented tasks, prediction tasks on RDBs have recently gained attention. In this work, we address this problem by generating informative relational features that enhance predictive performance. However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amjad Fatmi</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agent systems increasingly trigger real-world side effects: deploying infrastructure, modifying databases, moving money, and executing workflows. Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajan Das Gupta, Xiaobin Wu, Xun Liu, Jiaqi He</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the foremost cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for intelligent and data-driven diagnostic tools. Traditional predictive models often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous datasets and complex physiological patterns. To address this, we propose a hybrid ensemble framework that integrates deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with classical machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), using an ensemble voting mechanism. This approach combines the representational power of deep networks with the interpretability and efficiency of traditional models. Experiments on two publicly available Kaggle datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance, reaching 82.30 percent accuracy on Dataset I and 97.10 percent on Dataset II, with consistent gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings underscore the robustness and clinical potential of hybrid AI frameworks for predicting cardiovascular disease and facilitating early intervention. Furthermore, this study directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by promoting early diagnosis, prevention, and management of non-communicable diseases through innovative, data-driven healthcare solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Su, Kunzhao Xu, Yanjie Gao, Fan Yang, Cheng Li, Mao Yang, Tianyin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental problem of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to important applications is that LLMs do not always follow instructions, and violations are often hard to observe or check. In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17814">MMR-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal LLM Routing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxuan Ma, Guannan Lai, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet heterogeneity in architecture, alignment strategies, and efficiency means that no single model is uniformly superior across tasks. In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Yang, Xihan Bian, Jiayin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing frequency and complexity of regulatory updates present a significant burden for multinational pharmaceutical companies. Compliance teams must interpret evolving rules across jurisdictions, formats, and agencies, often manually, at high cost and risk of error. We introduce RegGuard, an industrial-scale AI assistant designed to automate the interpretation of heterogeneous regulatory texts and align them with internal corporate policies. The system ingests heterogeneous document sources through a secure pipeline and enhances retrieval and generation quality with two novel components: HiSACC (Hierarchical Semantic Aggregation for Contextual Chunking) semantically segments long documents into coherent units while maintaining consistency across non-contiguous sections. ReLACE (Regulatory Listwise Adaptive Cross-Encoder for Reranking), a domain-adapted cross-encoder built on an open-source model, jointly models user queries and retrieved candidates to improve ranking relevance. Evaluations in enterprise settings demonstrate that RegGuard improves answer quality specifically in terms of relevance, groundedness, and contextual focus, while significantly mitigating hallucination risk. The system architecture is built for auditability and traceability, featuring provenance tracking, access control, and incremental indexing, making it highly responsive to evolving document sources and relevant for any domain with stringent compliance demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanvi Verma, Yang Zhou, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Information Gain Fine-Tuning (IGFT), a novel approach for training medical conversational AI to conduct effective patient interviews and generate comprehensive History of Present Illness (HPI) without requiring pre-collected human conversations. IGFT combines online Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with information-theoretic rewards, enabling models to learn from self-generated conversations with simulated patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on expensive expert-annotated conversations or static datasets, our online RL framework allows models to discover effective questioning strategies through exploration. Our key innovation is an information gain reward function that tracks which clinical entities such as symptoms, temporal patterns, and medical history, are revealed during conversation. Each question's reward is computed based on its expected information gain combined with GPT-4o-mini quality assessments across dimensions including clinical relevance, patient engagement, and specificity. This hybrid approach ensures models learn to ask targeted, clinically appropriate questions that efficiently gather diagnostic information. We fine-tune two models using LoRA: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (a reasoning-optimized model). Training exclusively on Avey data containing concise HPIs, we evaluate generalization to MIMIC data with longer, more elaborate HPIs. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (IGFT) achieves F1 scores of 0.408 on Avey (10.9% improvement over base) and 0.289 on MIMIC (12.9% improvement), while Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (IGFT) reaches 0.384 and 0.336 respectively. Both models outperform OpenAI's model on MIMIC and surpass medical domain-specific baselines like HuatuoGPT and UltraMedical, which were optimized for single-turn medical QA rather than multi-turn conversations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-term memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to support personalized and sustained interactions. However, most work on personalized agents prioritizes utility and user experience, treating memory as a neutral component and largely overlooking its safety implications. In this paper, we reveal intent legitimation, a previously underexplored safety failure in personalized agents, where benign personal memories bias intent inference and cause models to legitimize inherently harmful queries. To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation. Overall, our work provides the first systematic exploration and evaluation of intent legitimation as a safety failure mode that naturally arises from benign, real-world personalization, highlighting the importance of assessing safety under long-term personal context.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Liu, Yinhe Long, Zhenya Huang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: A growing body of research suggests that the cognitive processes of large language models (LLMs) differ fundamentally from those of humans. However, existing interpretability methods remain limited in explaining how cognitive abilities are engaged during LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose UniCog, a unified framework that analyzes LLM cognition via a latent mind space. Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics. Finally, leveraging these insights, we introduce a latent-informed candidate prioritization strategy, which improves reasoning performance by up to 7.5% across challenging benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurabh Jha, Rohan Arora,  Bhavya, Noah Zheutlin, Paulina Toro Isaza, Laura Shwartz, Yu Deng, Daby Sow, Ruchi Mahindru, Ruchir Puri</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM agents excel when environments are mostly static and the needed information fits in a model's context window, but they often fail in open-ended investigations where explanations must be constructed by iteratively mining evidence from massive, heterogeneous operational data. These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.
  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) close the loop between experiment design, automated execution, and data-driven decision making, and they provide a demanding testbed for agentic AI under expensive actions, noisy and delayed feedback, strict feasibility and safety constraints, and non-stationarity. This survey uses soft matter as a representative setting but focuses on the AI questions that arise in real laboratories. We frame SDL autonomy as an agent environment interaction problem with explicit observations, actions, costs, and constraints, and we use this formulation to connect common SDL pipelines to established AI principles. We review the main method families that enable closed loop experimentation, including Bayesian optimization and active learning for sample efficient experiment selection, planning and reinforcement learning for long horizon protocol optimization, and tool using agents that orchestrate heterogeneous instruments and software. We emphasize verifiable and provenance aware policies that support debugging, reproducibility, and safe operation. We then propose a capability driven taxonomy that organizes systems by decision horizon, uncertainty modeling, action parameterization, constraint handling, failure recovery, and human involvement. To enable meaningful comparison, we synthesize benchmark task templates and evaluation metrics that prioritize cost aware performance, robustness to drift, constraint violation behavior, and reproducibility. Finally, we distill lessons from deployed SDLs and outline open challenges in multi-modal representation, calibrated uncertainty, safe exploration, and shared benchmark infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Najar</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong agents should expand their competence over time without retraining from scratch or overwriting previously learned behaviors. We investigate this in a challenging real-time control setting (Dark Souls III) by representing combat as a directed skill graph and training its components in a hierarchical curriculum. The resulting agent decomposes control into five reusable skills: camera control, target lock-on, movement, dodging, and a heal-attack decision policy, each optimized for a narrow responsibility. This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable. Empirically, we find that targeted fine-tuning of just two skills rapidly recovers performance under a limited interaction budget, suggesting that skill-graph curricula together with selective fine-tuning offer a practical pathway toward evolving, continually learning agents in complex real-time environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Jie Yang, Hung-Fu Chang, Po-An Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL has emerged as a prominent research area, particularly with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). By enabling users to query databases through natural language rather than SQL, this technology significantly lowers the barrier to data analysis. However, generating accurate SQL from natural language remains challenging due to ambiguity in user queries, the complexity of schema linking, limited generalization across SQL dialects, and the need for domain-specific understanding. In this study, we propose a Single-Agent Self-Refinement with Ensemble Voting (SSEV) pipeline built on PET-SQL that operates without ground-truth data, integrating self-refinement with Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) and its randomized variant (RWMA). Experimental results show that the SSEV achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, attaining execution accuracies of 85.5% on Spider 1.0-Dev, 86.4% on Spider 1.0-Test, and 66.3% on BIRD-Dev. Building on insights from the SSEV pipeline, we further propose ReCAPAgent-SQL (Refinement-Critique-Act-Plan agent-based SQL framework) to address the growing complexity of enterprise databases and real-world Text-to-SQL tasks. The framework integrates multiple specialized agents for planning, external knowledge retrieval, critique, action generation, self-refinement, schema linking, and result validation, enabling iterative refinement of SQL predictions through agent collaboration. ReCAPAgent-SQL's WMA results achieve 31% execution accuracy on the first 100 queries of Spider 2.0-Lite, demonstrating significant improvements in handling real-world enterprise scenarios. Overall, our work facilitates the deployment of scalable Text-to-SQL systems in practical settings, supporting better data-driven decision-making at lower cost and with greater efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyuan Fu, Lyuhao Chen, Yunze Xiao, Weihao Xuan, Carlos Busso, Mona Diab</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly used for social simulation, yet emotion is often treated as a transient cue, causing emotional amnesia and weak long-horizon continuity. We present Sentipolis, a framework for emotionally stateful agents that integrates continuous Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) representation, dual-speed emotion dynamics, and emotion--memory coupling. Across thousands of interactions over multiple base models and evaluators, Sentipolis improves emotionally grounded behavior, boosting communication, and emotional continuity. Gains are model-dependent: believability increases for higher-capacity models but can drop for smaller ones, and emotion-awareness can mildly reduce adherence to social norms, reflecting a human-like tension between emotion-driven behavior and rule compliance in social simulation. Network-level diagnostics show reciprocal, moderately clustered, and temporally stable relationship structures, supporting the study of cumulative social dynamics such as alliance formation and gradual relationship change.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiana Jafari, Paul Ulrich Nikolaus Rust, Duncan Eddy, Robbie Fraser, Nina Vasan, Darja Djordjevic, Akanksha Dadlani, Max Lamparth, Eugenia Kim, Mykel Kochenderfer</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from human feedback~(LHF) assumes that expert judgments, appropriately aggregated, yield valid ground truth for training and evaluating AI systems. We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $\alpha = -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Po Hsin, Ren-Hao Deng, Yao-Ting Hsieh, En-Ming Huang, Shih-Hao Hung</p>
<p>Abstract: Verilog's design cycle is inherently labor-intensive and necessitates extensive domain expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway toward automation, their limited training data and intrinsic sequential reasoning fail to capture the strict formal logic and concurrency inherent in hardware systems. To overcome these barriers, we present EvolVE, the first framework to analyze multiple evolution strategies on chip design tasks, revealing that Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) excels at maximizing functional correctness, while Idea-Guided Refinement (IGR) proves superior for optimization. We further leverage Structured Testbench Generation (STG) to accelerate the evolutionary process. To address the lack of complex optimization benchmarks, we introduce IC-RTL, targeting industry-scale problems derived from the National Integrated Circuit Contest. Evaluations establish EvolVE as the new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.1% on VerilogEval v2 and 92% on RTLLM v2. Furthermore, on the industry-scale IC-RTL suite, our framework surpasses reference implementations authored by contest participants, reducing the Power, Performance, Area (PPA) product by up to 66% in Huffman Coding and 17% in the geometric mean across all problems. The source code of the IC-RTL benchmark is available at https://github.com/weiber2002/ICRTL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Ye, Yiwen Duan, Yonghong Yu, Victor Ma, Yang Gao, Xing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: SQL is central to enterprise data engineering, yet generating fully correct SQL code in a single attempt remains difficult, even for experienced developers and advanced text-to-SQL LLMs, often requiring multiple debugging iterations. We introduce OurBench, the first benchmark for enterprise-level SQL reasoning and debugging. Our benchmark is built on two key innovations: (1) an automated construction workflow that uses reverse engineering to systematically inject realistic bugs into large-scale SQL code, enabling scalable and diverse benchmark generation; and (2) an execution-free evaluation framework tailored to enterprise settings, providing fast, accurate, and resource-efficient assessment.
  OurBench comprises 469 OurBenchSyn queries featuring syntax errors with explicit error messages, and 516 OurBenchSem queries targeting semantic errors in which the code fails to meet user intent. The queries are highly complex, averaging over 140 lines and featuring deep and wide abstract syntax trees.
  Evaluation of nearly 30 LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model, Claude-4-Sonnet, achieves only 36.46 percent accuracy on OurBenchSyn and 32.17 percent on OurBenchSem, while most models score below 20 percent. We further explore four solution strategies, identify key challenges, and outline promising directions for enterprise SQL debugging with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, Bivin Pradeep, James Brusey</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical domestic immersion water heater systems are often operated continuously during winter, heating quickly rather than efficiently and ignoring predictable demand windows and ambient losses. We study deadline-aware control, where the aim is to reach a target temperature at a specified time while minimising energy consumption. We introduce an efficient Gymnasium environment that models an immersion hot water heater with first-order thermal losses and discrete on and off actions of 0 W and 6000 W applied every 120 seconds. Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps. In a representative trajectory with a 50 kg water mass, 20 degrees Celsius ambient temperature, and a 60 degrees Celsius target, PPO consumes 54 percent less energy than bang-bang control and 33 percent less than MCTS. These results show that learned deadline-aware control reduces energy consumption under identical physical assumptions, while planners provide partial savings without training and learned policies offer near-zero inference cost once trained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jize Wang, Han Wu, Zhiyuan You, Yiming Song, Yijun Wang, Zifei Shan, Yining Li, Songyang Zhang, Xinyi Le, Cailian Chen, Xinping Guan, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) improves LLM performance through layered collaboration, but its dense topology raises costs and latency. Existing methods employ LLM judges to filter responses, yet still require all models to perform inference before judging, failing to cut costs effectively. They also lack model selection criteria and struggle with large model pools, where full inference is costly and can exceed context limits. To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency. RouteMoA outperforms MoA across varying tasks and model pool sizes, reducing cost by 89.8% and latency by 63.6% in the large-scale model pool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Hongru Zhou, Huahui Yi, Shiyu Feng, Hanyu Zhou, Tiancheng He, Mingke You, Li Wang, Qiankun Li, Kun Wang, Weili Fu, Kang Li, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Missed and delayed diagnosis remains a major challenge in rare disease care. At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks. By incorporating calibrated reasoning into a single model, RareAlert enables accurate, privacy-preserving, and scalable rare disease risk screening suitable for large-scale local deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinger Zhang, Shutong Jiang, Renhao Li, Jianhong Tu, Yang Su, Lianghao Deng, Xudong Guo, Chenxu Lv, Junyang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: While agent evaluation has shifted toward long-horizon tasks, most benchmarks still emphasize local, step-level reasoning rather than the global constrained optimization (e.g., time and financial budgets) that demands genuine planning ability. Meanwhile, existing LLM planning benchmarks underrepresent the active information gathering and fine-grained local constraints typical of real-world settings. To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18175">Success Conditioning as Policy Improvement: The Optimization Problem Solved by Imitating Success</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: A widely used technique for improving policies is success conditioning, in which one collects trajectories, identifies those that achieve a desired outcome, and updates the policy to imitate the actions taken along successful trajectories. This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $\chi^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaokang Wang, Pei Fu, Ruoceng Zhang, Shaojie Zhang, Xiuwen Xi, Jiahui Yang, Bin Qin, Ying Huang, Zhenbo Luo, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced GUI agents' capabilities in parsing textual instructions, interpreting screen content, and executing tasks, a critical challenge persists: the irreversibility of agent operations, where a single erroneous action can trigger catastrophic deviations. To address this, we propose the GUI Action Critic's Data Flywheel System (GAIA), a training framework that enables the models to have iterative critic capabilities, which are used to improve the Test-Time Scaling (TTS) of basic GUI agents' performance. Specifically, we train an Intuitive Critic Model (ICM) using positive and negative action examples from a base agent first. This critic evaluates the immediate correctness of the agent's intended actions, thereby selecting operations with higher success probability. Then, the initial critic guides agent actions to collect refined positive/negative samples, initiating the self-improving cycle. The augmented data then trains a second-round critic with enhanced discernment capability. We conduct experiments on various datasets and demonstrate that the proposed ICM can improve the test-time performance of various closed-source and open-source models, and the performance can be gradually improved as the data is recycled. The code and dataset will be publicly released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep search agents, which aim to answer complex questions requiring reasoning across multiple documents, can significantly speed up the information-seeking process. Collecting human annotations for this application is prohibitively expensive due to long and complex exploration trajectories. We propose an agentic pipeline that automatically generates high quality, difficulty-controlled deep search question-answer pairs for a given corpus and a target difficulty level. Our pipeline, SAGE, consists of a data generator which proposes QA pairs and a search agent which attempts to solve the generated question and provide execution feedback for the data generator. The two components interact over multiple rounds to iteratively refine the question-answer pairs until they satisfy the target difficulty level. Our intrinsic evaluation shows SAGE generates questions that require diverse reasoning strategies, while significantly increases the correctness and difficulty of the generated data. Our extrinsic evaluation demonstrates up to 23% relative performance gain on popular deep search benchmarks by training deep search agents with our synthetic data. Additional experiments show that agents trained on our data can adapt from fixed-corpus retrieval to Google Search at inference time, without further training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Liu, Lin Guan, Yixin Nie, Kai Zhang, Zhuoqun Hao, Lin Chen, Asli Celikyilmaz, Zhaoran Wang, Na Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalist LLM agents are often post-trained on a narrow set of environments but deployed across far broader, unseen domains. In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in e-commerce shopping. To perform thorough, user-tailored product searches, agents should interpret personal preferences, engage in multi-turn dialogues, and ultimately retrieve and discriminate among highly similar products. However, existing research has yet to provide a unified simulation environment that consistently captures all of these aspects, and always focuses solely on evaluation benchmarks without training support. In this paper, we introduce ShopSimulator, a large-scale and challenging Chinese shopping environment. Leveraging ShopSimulator, we evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios, finding that even the best-performing models achieve less than 40% full-success rate. Error analysis reveals that agents struggle with deep search and product selection in long trajectories, fail to balance the use of personalization cues, and to effectively engage with users. Further training exploration provides practical guidance for overcoming these weaknesses, with the combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) yielding significant performance improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Li, Shijun Yang, Weizhen Qi, Silei Zhao, Rui Hua, Mingzhu Song, Xiaojian Yang, Chao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional agent systems often struggle in open-ended environments where task distributions continuously drift and external supervision is scarce. Their reliance on static toolsets or offline training lags behind these dynamics, leaving the system's capability boundaries rigid and unknown. To address this, we propose the In-Situ Self-Evolving paradigm. This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals. Within this framework, we develop Yunjue Agent, a system that iteratively synthesizes, optimizes, and reuses tools to navigate emerging challenges. To optimize evolutionary efficiency, we further introduce a Parallel Batch Evolution strategy. Empirical evaluations across five diverse benchmarks under a zero-start setting demonstrate significant performance gains over proprietary baselines. Additionally, complementary warm-start evaluations confirm that the accumulated general knowledge can be seamlessly transferred to novel domains. Finally, we propose a novel metric to monitor evolution convergence, serving as a function analogous to training loss in conventional optimization. We open-source our codebase, system traces, and evolved tools to facilitate future research in resilient, self-evolving intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wei, Jinpeng Ou, Xiao Peng, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in function calling for autonomous agents, yet current mechanisms lack explicit reasoning transparency during parameter generation, particularly for complex functions with interdependent parameters. While existing approaches like chain-of-thought prompting operate at the agent level, they fail to provide fine-grained reasoning guidance for individual function parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal "think" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility. Evaluation on ToolBench across proprietary and open-source models demonstrates significant improvements in parameter generation accuracy and reasoning coherence for multi-parameter functions, while providing enhanced interpretability for debugging AI agent behaviors.</p>

Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot shows improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust. By combining predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI, Climate RADAR advances people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuhin Chakrabarty, Paramveer S. Dhillon</p>
<p>Abstract: Creative writing has long been considered a uniquely human endeavor, requiring voice and style that machines could not replicate. This assumption is challenged by Generative AI that can emulate thousands of author styles in seconds with negligible marginal labor. To understand this better, we conducted a behavioral experiment where 28 MFA writers (experts) competed against three LLMs in emulating 50 critically acclaimed authors. Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes "good writing." These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghan Hou, Zongyou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To facilitate the transformation of legacy finite difference implementations into the Devito environment, this study develops an integrated AI agent framework. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior.</p>

This work uses attention maps to analyze the influence of reasoning traces and uncover an interesting phenomenon: only some decision-critical tokens in a reasoning trace steer the model toward the final answer, while the remaining tokens contribute negligibly. Building on this observation, we propose Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection (DynTS). This method identifies decision-critical tokens and retains only their associated Key-Value (KV) cache states during inference, evicting the remaining redundant entries to optimize efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhou, Kai Zheng, Qiguang Chen, Mengkang Hu, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Jingjing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep research agents have shown remarkable potential in handling long-horizon tasks. However, state-of-the-art performance typically relies on online reinforcement learning (RL), which is financially expensive due to extensive API calls. While offline training offers a more efficient alternative, its progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality research trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs. Leveraging these resources, we train OffSeeker (8B), a model developed entirely offline. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show that OffSeeker not only leads among similar-sized agents but also remains competitive with 30B-parameter systems trained via heavy online RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of AI agents introduces complex safety and security challenges arising from autonomous tool use and environmental interactions. Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios. All models and datasets are openly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan wang, Hao Wang, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Yiqun Zhang, Jinghao Lin, Haihua Yang, Xiaozhong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical reasoning models remain constrained by parametric knowledge and are thus susceptible to forgetting and hallucinations. DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus "find it but fail to use it," leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Purpura, Li Wang, Sahil Badyal, Eugenio Beaufrand, Adam Faulkner</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliably ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) follow complex instructions is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world use or isolate compliance from task success. We introduce MOSAIC (MOdular Synthetic Assessment of Instruction Compliance), a modular framework that uses a dynamically generated dataset with up to 20 application-oriented generation constraints to enable a granular and independent analysis of this capability. Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position. The analysis reveals model-specific weaknesses, uncovers synergistic and conflicting interactions between instructions, and identifies distinct positional biases such as primacy and recency effects. These granular insights are critical for diagnosing model failures and developing more reliable LLMs for systems that demand strict adherence to complex instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzhe Meng, Qiangsheng Zeng, Ling Luo, Qinghan Yang, Jiarui Hao, Wenbo Wu, Qinyu Wang, Rui Yin, Lin Qi, Renzhi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training stability is typically regarded as a prerequisite for reliable optimization in large language models. In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Cotnareanu, Didier Chetelat, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive formal reasoning abilities, they often break down when problems require complex proof planning. One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Fumagalli, R. Teal Witter, Christopher Musco</p>
<p>Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a central game-theoretic tool in explainable AI (XAI). However, computing Shapley values exactly requires $2^d$ game evaluations for a model with $d$ features. Lundberg and Lee's KernelSHAP algorithm has emerged as a leading method for avoiding this exponential cost. KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.
  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent.
  Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Orhan, Pablo Diego-Sim\'on, Emmnanuel Chemla, Yair Lakretz, Yves Boubenec, Jean-R\'emi King</p>
<p>Abstract: During language acquisition, children successively learn to categorize phonemes, identify words, and combine them with syntax to form new meaning. While the development of this behavior is well characterized, we still lack a unifying computational framework to explain its underlying neural representations. Here, we investigate whether and when phonemic, lexical, and syntactic representations emerge in the activations of artificial neural networks during their training. Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge. Together, these results show conditions under which major stages of language acquisition spontaneously emerge, and hence delineate a promising path to understand the computations underpinning language acquisition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abeer Badawi, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Elahe Rahimi, Sheri Grach, Lindsay Bertrand, Lames Danok, Frank Rudzicz, Jimmy Huang, Elham Dolatabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating global mental health crisis, marked by persistent treatment gaps, availability, and a shortage of qualified therapists, positions Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising avenue for scalable support. While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Haoyu Sun, Jiawei Gu, Linjie Li, Luxin Xu, Ranjay Krishna, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wei, Xu Dong, Xiao Peng, Niantao Xie, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models deployed as autonomous agents face critical memory limitations, lacking selective forgetting mechanisms that lead to either catastrophic forgetting at context boundaries or information overload within them. While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Sui, Yanyan Zhao, Yulin Hu, Jiahe Guo, Weixiang Zhao, Bing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation requires not only affective expression but also grounded instrumental support to provide trustworthy guidance. However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rubrics are essential for evaluating open-ended LLM responses, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. However, creating high-quality and domain-specific rubrics typically requires significant human expertise time and development cost, making rubric-based evaluation and training difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naeyma N. Islam, Thomas R. Caulfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42), contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for designing UPS-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multi-agent systems, but scaling them is economically unsustainable: coordinating heterogeneous agents under information asymmetry often spirals costs. Existing paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Agents and knowledge-based routers, rely on heuristic proxies that ignore costs and collapse uncertainty structure, leading to provably suboptimal coordination. We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x. These results establish market-based coordination as a principled and scalable paradigm for building economically viable multi-agent visual intelligence systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and crucial for critical applications ranging from energy management to traffic control. Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBench provides a standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models.

Evaluated on multiple benchmarks-including expert-curated queries-our system achieves $87\%$ recall, $83\%$ claim recall, and $92\%$ faithfulness, representing a $16\%$ improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Cheng Tang, Lei Gong, Cheng Li, Chao Wang, teng wang, Wenqi Lou, Xuehai Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) significantly improves accuracy on complex tasks, yet incurs excessive memory overhead due to the long think-stage sequences stored in the Key-Value (KV) cache. Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow. Finally, we introduce an adaptive cache budget allocation algorithm. Based on the dynamic proportion of CrystalKV, it estimates the importance of each layer/head and adjusts the KV cache budget during inference, amplifying critical components to improve budget utilization. Results show that Crystal-KV achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, significantly improves throughput, and enables faster response time, while maintaining, or even improving, answer accuracy for CoT reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunyang Luo, Peibei Cao, Zhihui Zhu, Kehua Feng, Zhihua Wang, Keyan Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models, yet their practical effectiveness hinges on generalization to unseen prompts and shifting distributions. Most existing RM evaluations rely on static, pre-annotated preference datasets, which provide limited coverage and often fail to faithfully assess generalization in open-world settings. We introduce Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competition (PMDC), a dynamic and annotation-efficient framework for evaluating RM generalization using a large, unlabeled, open-domain prompt pool. PMDC actively selects prompt--response pairs that maximize disagreement between two RMs, yielding a compact set of highly contentious test cases. These cases are adjudicated by an oracle, and the resulting outcomes are aggregated via a Bradley--Terry model to produce a global ranking and pairwise win-rate landscape of RMs. We apply PMDC to re-evaluate 10 representative RMs and observe substantial rank reshuffling compared with conventional benchmarks. Qualitative analyses further uncover systematic generalization failures, providing valuable insights for improving reward modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longteng Zhang, Sen Wu, Shuai Hou, Zhengyu Qing, Zhuo Zheng, Danning Ke, Qihong Lin, Qiang Wang, Shaohuai Shi, Xiaowen Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks often entails fine-tuning millions of parameters or deploying costly dense weight updates, which hinders their use in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\times$ inference speedup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiran Li, Fangzhou Lin, Shuo Xing, Xiang Zheng, Xi Hong, Jiashuo Sun, Zhengzhong Tu, Chaoqun Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Citations are the bedrock of scientific authority, yet their integrity is compromised by widespread miscitations: ranging from nuanced distortions to fabricated references. Systematic citation verification is currently unfeasible; manual review cannot scale to modern publishing volumes, while existing automated tools are restricted by abstract-only analysis or small-scale, domain-specific datasets in part due to the "paywall barrier" of full-text access. We introduce BibAgent, a scalable, end-to-end agentic framework for automated citation verification. BibAgent integrates retrieval, reasoning, and adaptive evidence aggregation, applying distinct strategies for accessible and paywalled sources. For paywalled references, it leverages a novel Evidence Committee mechanism that infers citation validity via downstream citation consensus. To support systematic evaluation, we contribute a 5-category Miscitation Taxonomy and MisciteBench, a massive cross-disciplinary benchmark comprising 6,350 miscitation samples spanning 254 fields. Our results demonstrate that BibAgent outperforms state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) baselines in citation verification accuracy and interpretability, providing scalable, transparent detection of citation misalignments across the scientific literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Gao, Shasha Li, Jianhua Zhang, Shan Li, Tingting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a growing trend in employing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) techniques to support learning. Moreover, scholars have reached a consensus on the critical role of self-regulated learning (SRL) in ensuring learning effectiveness within GenAI-assisted learning environments, making it essential to capture students' dynamic SRL patterns. In this study, we extracted students' interaction patterns with GenAI from trace data as they completed a problem-solving task within a GenAI-assisted intelligent tutoring system. Students' purpose of using GenAI was also analyzed from the perspective of information processing, i.e., information acquisition and information transformation. Using sequential and clustering analysis, this study classified participants into two groups based on their SRL sequences. These two groups differed in the frequency and temporal characteristics of GenAI use. In addition, most students used GenAI for information acquisition rather than information transformation, while the correlation between the purpose of using GenAI and learning performance was not statistically significant. Our findings inform both pedagogical design and the development of GenAI-assisted learning environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhubalan Mani</p>
<p>Abstract: The reliability of survey data is crucial in supply chain decision-making, particularly when evaluating readiness for AI-driven tools such as safety stock optimization systems. However, surveys often attract low-effort or fake responses that degrade the accuracy of derived insights. This study proposes a lightweight AI-based framework for filtering unreliable survey inputs using a supervised machine learning approach. In this expanded study, a larger dataset of 99 industry responses was collected, with manual labeling to identify fake responses based on logical inconsistencies and response patterns. After preprocessing and label encoding, both Random Forest and baseline models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) were trained to distinguish genuine from fake responses. The best-performing model achieved an 92.0% accuracy rate, demonstrating improved detection compared to the pilot study. Despite limitations, the results highlight the viability of integrating AI into survey pipelines and provide a scalable solution for improving data integrity in supply chain research, especially during product launch and technology adoption phases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchen Li, Jing Chen, Xuzhao Li, Hao Liang, Xiaohuan Zhou, Taifeng Wang, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In mathematical reasoning tasks, the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on high-quality training data with clearly defined and well-graded difficulty levels. However, existing data synthesis methods often suffer from limited diversity and lack precise control over problem difficulty, making them insufficient for supporting efficient training paradigms such as curriculum learning. To address these challenges, we propose MathMixup, a novel data synthesis paradigm that systematically generates high-quality, difficulty-controllable mathematical reasoning problems through hybrid and decomposed strategies. Automated self-checking and manual screening are incorporated to ensure semantic clarity and a well-structured difficulty gradient in the synthesized data. Building on this, we construct the MathMixupQA dataset and design a curriculum learning strategy that leverages these graded problems, supporting flexible integration with other datasets. Experimental results show that MathMixup and its curriculum learning strategy significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning performance of LLMs. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average score of 52.6\% across seven mathematical benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. These results fully validate the effectiveness and broad applicability of MathMixup in improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs and advancing data-centric curriculum learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonia Katyal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this Article, I explore the impending conflict between the protection of civil rights and artificial intelligence (AI). While both areas of law have amassed rich and well-developed areas of scholarly work and doctrinal support, a growing body of scholars are interrogating the intersection between them. This Article argues that the issues surrounding algorithmic accountability demonstrate a deeper, more structural tension within a new generation of disputes regarding law and technology. As I argue, the true promise of AI does not lie in the information we reveal to one another, but rather in the questions it raises about the interaction of technology, property, and civil rights. For this reason, I argue that we are looking in the wrong place if we look only to the state to address issues of algorithmic accountability. Instead, we must turn to other ways to ensure more transparency and accountability that stem from private industry, rather than public regulation. The issue of algorithmic bias represents a crucial new world of civil rights concerns, one that is distinct in nature from the ones that preceded it. Since we are in a world where the activities of private corporations, rather than the state, are raising concerns about privacy, due process, and discrimination, we must focus on the role of private corporations in addressing the issue. Towards this end, I discuss a variety of tools to help eliminate the opacity of AI, including codes of conduct, impact statements, and whistleblower protection, which I argue carries the potential to encourage greater endogeneity in civil rights enforcement. Ultimately, by examining the relationship between private industry and civil rights, we can perhaps develop a new generation of forms of accountability in the process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salah Feras Alali, Mohammad Nashat Maasfeh, Mucahid Kutlu, Saban Kardas</p>
<p>Abstract: With the incredible advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), many people have started using them to satisfy their information needs. However, utilizing LLMs might be problematic for political issues where disagreement is common and model outputs may reflect training-data biases or deliberate alignment choices. To better characterize such behavior, we assess the stances of nine LLMs on 24 politically sensitive issues using five prompting techniques. We find that models often adopt opposing stances on several issues; some positions are malleable under prompting, while others remain stable. Among the models examined, Grok-3-mini is the most persistent, whereas Mistral-7B is the least. For issues involving countries with different languages, models tend to support the side whose language is used in the prompt. Notably, no prompting technique alters model stances on the Qatar blockade or the oppression of Palestinians. We hope these findings raise user awareness when seeking political guidance from LLMs and encourage developers to address these concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Margarida Romero (IIIA / CSIC, UniCA)</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Creativity, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Collaboration (the 4Cs) is a central objective of contemporary competency-based education. However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules.</p>

<p>Abstract: Technological developments have produced methods that can generate educational videos from input text or sound. Recently, the use of deep learning techniques for image and video generation has been widely explored, particularly in education. However, generating video content from conditional inputs such as text or speech remains a challenging area. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to the educational structure, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which develop frame-for-frame frameworks and are able to create full educational videos. The proposed system is structured into three main phases In the first phase, the input (either text or speech) is transcribed using speech recognition. In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan-Jin Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has created a pressing challenge in computer science (CS) education: how to incorporate powerful AI tools into programming coursework without undermining student learning through cognitive offloading. This paper presents an assessment model that permits the use of generative AI for take-home programming assignments while enforcing individual mastery through immediate, assignment-driven written quizzes. To promote authentic learning, these in-class, closed-book assessments are weighted more heavily than the assignments themselves and are specifically designed to verify the student's comprehension of the algorithms, structure, and implementation details of their submitted code. Preliminary empirical data were collected from an upper-level computer science course to examine the relationship between self-reported GenAI usage and performance on AI-free quizzes, exams, and final course grades. Statistical analyses revealed no meaningful linear correlation between GenAI usage levels and assessment outcomes, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently near zero. These preliminary results suggest that allowing GenAI for programming assignments does not diminish students' mastery of course concepts when learning is verified through targeted, assignment-driven quizzes. Although limited by a small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence that the risks of cognitive offloading can be mitigated by allowing AI-assisted programming practice while verifying understanding through assignment-driven, AI-free quizzes. The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: While synthetic data has proven effective for improving scientific reasoning in the text domain, multimodal reasoning remains constrained by the difficulty of synthesizing scientifically rigorous images. Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit "understand - plan - code" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan</p>
<p>Abstract: Tropical algebra, including max-plus, min-plus, and related idempotent semirings, provides a unifying framework in which many optimization problems that are nonlinear in classical algebra become linear. This property makes tropical methods particularly well suited for shortest paths, scheduling, throughput analysis, and discrete event systems. Despite their theoretical maturity and practical relevance, existing tropical algebra implementations primarily target desktop or server environments and remain largely inaccessible on resource-constrained embedded platforms, where such optimization problems are most acute. We present PALMA (Parallel Algebra Library for Max-plus Applications), a lightweight, dependency-free C library that brings tropical linear algebra to ARM-based embedded systems. PALMA implements a generic semiring abstraction with SIMD-accelerated kernels, enabling a single computational framework to support shortest paths, bottleneck paths, reachability, scheduling, and throughput analysis. The library supports five tropical semirings, dense and sparse (CSR) representations, tropical closure, and spectral analysis via maximum cycle mean computation. We evaluate PALMA on a Raspberry Pi 4 and demonstrate peak performance of 2,274 MOPS, speedups of up to 11.9 times over classical Bellman-Ford for single-source shortest paths, and sub-10 microsecond scheduling solves for real-time control workloads. Case studies in UAV control, IoT routing, and manufacturing systems show that tropical algebra enables efficient, predictable, and unified optimization directly on embedded hardware. PALMA is released as open-source software under the MIT license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Xu, Fuquan Zong, Yexuan Xing, Chulong Zhang, Guang Yang, Shilong Yang, Xiaokun Liang, Juan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of medical image segmentation is increasingly defined by the efficiency of data utilization rather than merely the volume of raw data. Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology. Comprehensive experiments on a hybrid dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the data efficiency and robustness of state-of-the-art models, including nnU-Net and U-Mamba, offering a potent strategy for high-performance medical image analysis with limited annotation budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aahana Basappa, Pranay Goel, Anusri Karra, Anish Karra, Asa Gilmore, Kevin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigated visual reasoning limitations of both multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) by creating a novel benchmark to systematically compare failure modes across image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, enabling cross-modal evaluation of visual understanding. Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mangroves are critical for climate-change mitigation, requiring reliable monitoring for effective conservation. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for mangrove detection, its progress is hindered by the limitations of existing datasets. In particular, many resources provide only annual map products without curated single-date image-mask pairs, limited to specific regions rather than global coverage, or remain inaccessible to the public. To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings. We also provide a benchmark across diverse semantic segmentation architectures under a country-disjoint split, establishing a foundation for scalable and reliable global mangrove monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: The transcription of historical documents written in Latin in XV and XVI centuries has special challenges as it must maintain the characters and special symbols that have distinct meanings to ensure that historical texts retain their original style and significance. This work proposes a pipeline for the transcription of historical documents preserving these special features. We propose to extend an existing text line recognition method with a layout analysis model. We analyze historical text images using a layout analysis model to extract text lines, which are then processed by an OCR model to generate a fully digitized page. We showed that our pipeline facilitates the processing of the page and produces an efficient result. We evaluated our approach on multiple datasets and demonstrate that the masked autoencoder effectively processes different types of text, including handwritten, printed and multi-language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadeer Alanazi, Abir Benabid</p>
<p>Abstract: Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) is an essential communication method for individuals in the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%. These results offer preliminary insights into the viability of multimodal fusion for sign language recognition and highlight areas for further optimization and dataset expansion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyuan Liu, Libin Hou, Linyuan Wang, Bin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR2)-driven white-box transformer, grounded in structured representation learning, unifies interpretability and efficiency, providing a reliable white-box solution for visual modeling. However, in existing designs, tight coupling between "membership matrix" and "subspace matrix U" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the "membership matrix" and "subspaces U" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Compared with vanilla Transformer architectures, DMST exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency and interpretability.</p>

In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christina Garcia, Nhat Tan Le, Taihei Fujioka, Umang Dobhal, Milyun Ni'ma Shoumi, Thanh Nha Nguyen, Sozo Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Recognize the Unseen: Unusual Behavior Recognition from Pose Data Challenge, hosted at ISAS 2025. The challenge aims to address the critical need for automated recognition of unusual behaviors in facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities using non-invasive pose estimation data. Participating teams were tasked with distinguishing between normal and unusual activities based on skeleton keypoints extracted from video recordings of simulated scenarios. The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures. Submissions were assessed primarily using macro-averaged F1 scores to account for class imbalance. The results highlight the difficulty of modeling rare, abrupt actions in noisy, low-dimensional data, and emphasize the importance of capturing both temporal and contextual nuances in behavior modeling. Insights from this challenge may contribute to future developments in socially responsible AI applications for healthcare and behavior monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun An, Yiliang Song, Jiawei Shao, Zhe Sun, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse social interactions, such as bullying, harassment, and other illicit activities, pose significant threats to individual well-being and public safety, leaving profound impacts on physical and mental health. However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Bo, Jingyu Hu, Debbie Watson, Weiru Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The potential for bias and unfairness in AI-supporting government services raises ethical and legal concerns. Using crime rate prediction with the Bristol City Council data as a case study, we examine how these issues persist. Rather than auditing real-world deployed systems, our goal is to understand why widely adopted bias mitigation techniques often fail when applied to government data. Our findings reveal that bias mitigation approaches applied to government data are not always effective -- not because of flaws in model architecture or metric selection, but due to the inherent properties of the data itself. Through comparing a set of comprehensive models and fairness methods, our experiments consistently show that the mitigation efforts cannot overcome the embedded unfairness in the data -- further reinforcing that the origin of bias lies in the structure and history of government datasets. We then explore the reasons for the mitigation failures in predictive models on government data and highlight the potential sources of unfairness posed by data distribution shifts, the accumulation of historical bias, and delays in data release. We also discover the limitations of the blind spots in fairness analysis and bias mitigation methods when only targeting a single sensitive feature through a set of intersectional fairness experiments. Although this study is limited to one city, the findings are highly suggestive, which can contribute to an early warning that biases in government data may persist even with standard mitigation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data preparation aims to denoise raw datasets, uncover cross-dataset relationships, and extract valuable insights from them, which is essential for a wide range of data-centric applications. Driven by (i) rising demands for application-ready data (e.g., for analytics, visualization, decision-making), (ii) increasingly powerful LLM techniques, and (iii) the emergence of infrastructures that facilitate flexible agent construction (e.g., using Databricks Unity Catalog), LLM-enhanced methods are rapidly becoming a transformative and potentially dominant paradigm for data preparation.
  By investigating hundreds of recent literature works, this paper presents a systematic review of this evolving landscape, focusing on the use of LLM techniques to prepare data for diverse downstream tasks. First, we characterize the fundamental paradigm shift, from rule-based, model-specific pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware, and agentic preparation workflows. Next, we introduce a task-centric taxonomy that organizes the field into three major tasks: data cleaning (e.g., standardization, error processing, imputation), data integration (e.g., entity matching, schema matching), and data enrichment (e.g., data annotation, profiling). For each task, we survey representative techniques, and highlight their respective strengths (e.g., improved generalization, semantic understanding) and limitations (e.g., the prohibitive cost of scaling LLMs, persistent hallucinations even in advanced agents, the mismatch between advanced methods and weak evaluation). Moreover, we analyze commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics (the empirical part). Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derek Shiller, Laura Duffy, Arvo Mu\~noz Mor\'an, Adri\`a Moret, Chris Percy, Hayley Clatterbuck</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificially intelligent systems have become remarkably sophisticated. They hold conversations, write essays, and seem to understand context in ways that surprise even their creators. This raises a crucial question: Are we creating systems that are conscious? The Digital Consciousness Model (DCM) is a first attempt to assess the evidence for consciousness in AI systems in a systematic, probabilistic way. It provides a shared framework for comparing different AIs and biological organisms, and for tracking how the evidence changes over time as AI develops. Instead of adopting a single theory of consciousness, it incorporates a range of leading theories and perspectives - acknowledging that experts disagree fundamentally about what consciousness is and what conditions are necessary for it. This report describes the structure and initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model. Overall, we find that the evidence is against 2024 LLMs being conscious, but the evidence against 2024 LLMs being conscious is not decisive. The evidence against LLM consciousness is much weaker than the evidence against consciousness in simpler AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert M. Belcher, Brendan C. Degryse, Leonard R. Kosta, Christopher J. Lowrance</p>
<p>Abstract: Adjusting rifle sights, a process commonly called "zeroing," requires shooters to identify and differentiate bullet holes from multiple firing iterations. Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration. While designed for rifle zeroing, this framework offers broader applicability in domains requiring the temporal differentiation of visually similar objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeongju Kim, Jungwan Lee, Donghyeon Han, Hoi-Jun Yoo, Sangyeob Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained attention for efficiently scaling large language models. Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article examines the applicability of the Digital Services Act (DSA) to ChatGPT, arguing that it should be classified as a hybrid of the two types of hosting services: online search engines and platforms. This requires classifying search engines as hosting services, which we show is appropriate under the DSA, thereby resolving an ambiguity in the legal framework. ChatGPT performs core search functions and stores user-provided inputs and custom GPTs, meeting the definition of hosting service. We compare ChatGPT's systemic risks with those of existing Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) and Platforms (VLOPs), showing that it raises similarly serious concerns regarding illegal content, fundamental rights, democratic integrity, and public health. Now that ChatGPT has reached the 45 million EU user threshold, it should be subject to the most onerous DSA obligations, requiring the assessment and mitigation of risk emanating from both its online search engine- and platform-like characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event forecasting is inherently influenced by multifaceted considerations, including international relations, regional historical dynamics, and cultural contexts. However, existing LLM-based approaches employ single-model architectures that generate predictions along a singular explicit trajectory, constraining their ability to capture diverse geopolitical nuances across complex regional contexts.

To facilitate expert specialization and rigorous evaluation, we construct POLECAT-FOR-ME, a Middle East-focused event forecasting benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of multi-expert collaboration in handling complex temporal geopolitical forecasting tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahil Shaik, Jonathon M. Smereka, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has been the dominant paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), but its reliance on global state information during training introduces scalability, robustness, and generalization bottlenecks. Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability. To the best of our knowledge, DG-MAPPO appears to be the first to fully eliminate reliance on privileged centralized information, enabling agents to learn and act solely through peer-to-peer communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonia Katyal, Aniket Kesari</p>
<p>Abstract: Almost every industry today confronts the potential role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in its future. While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: The accurate estimation of Arctic snow depth ($h_s$) remains a critical time-varying inverse problem due to the extreme scarcity and noise inherent in associated sea ice parameters. Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and physics-guided contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference.Our core innovation lies in a surjective, physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct $h_s$ ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20\% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods. This approach pioneers a path for noise-tolerant, interpretable inverse modeling, with wide applicability in geospatial and cryospheric domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Chen, Yue Wu, Kai Huang, Wen Xi, Yangyang Wu, Xiaoye Miao, Mengying Zhu, Meng Xi, Guanjie Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view multi-label classification (MvMLC) is indispensable for modern web applications aggregating information from diverse sources. However, real-world web-scale settings are rife with missing views and continuously emerging classes, which pose significant obstacles to robust learning. Prevailing methods are ill-equipped for this reality, as they either lack adaptability to new classes or incur exponential parameter growth when handling all possible missing-view patterns, severely limiting their scalability in web environments. To systematically address this gap, we formally introduce a novel task, termed \emph{incomplete multi-view multi-label class incremental learning} (IMvMLCIL), which requires models to simultaneously address heterogeneous missing views and dynamic class expansion. To tackle this task, we propose \textsf{E2PL}, an Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning framework for IMvMLCIL. \textsf{E2PL} unifies two novel prompt designs: \emph{task-tailored prompts} for class-incremental adaptation and \emph{missing-aware prompts} for the flexible integration of arbitrary view-missing scenarios. To fundamentally address the exponential parameter explosion inherent in missing-aware prompts, we devise an \emph{efficient prototype tensorization} module, which leverages atomic tensor decomposition to elegantly reduce the prompt parameter complexity from exponential to linear w.r.t. the number of views. We further incorporate a \emph{dynamic contrastive learning} strategy explicitly model the complex dependencies among diverse missing-view patterns, thus enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that \textsf{E2PL} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seung Gyu Jeong, Seong-Eun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated respiratory sound classification supports the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. However, many deep models still rely on cycle-level analysis and suffer from patient-specific overfitting. We propose PC-MCL (Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning) to address these limitations by utilizing three key components: multi-cycle concatenation, a 3-label formulation, and a patient-matching auxiliary task. Our work resolves a multi-label distributional bias in respiratory sound classification, a critical issue inherent to applying multi-cycle concatenation with the conventional 2-label formulation (crackle, wheeze). This bias manifests as a systematic loss of normal signal information when normal and abnormal cycles are combined. Our proposed 3-label formulation (normal, crackle, wheeze) corrects this by preserving information from all constituent cycles in mixed samples. Furthermore, the patient-matching auxiliary task acts as a multi-task regularizer, encouraging the model to learn more robust features and improving generalization. On the ICBHI 2017 benchmark, PC-MCL achieves an ICBHI Score of 65.37%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that all three components are essential, working synergistically to improve the detection of abnormal respiratory events.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iman Peivaste, Ahmed Makradi, Salim Belouettar</p>
<p>Abstract: The discovery of high-performance organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains limited by the vastness of chemical space and the reliance on human intuition for molecular design. Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $\pi$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Pratap Singh, Harshit Singh, Nityanand Mathur, Akshat Mandloi, Sudarshan Kamath</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems systematically mispronounce low-resource proper nouns, particularly non-English names, brands, and geographic locations, due to their underrepresentation in predominantly English training corpora. Existing solutions typically rely on expensive multilingual data collection, supervised finetuning, or manual phonetic annotation, which limits the deployment of TTS systems in linguistically diverse settings. We introduce SonoEdit, a model editing technique that surgically corrects pronunciation errors in pre-trained TTS models without retraining. Instead of costly finetuning or explicit phoneme injection, we propose a parsimonious alternative based on Null-Space Pronunciation Editing, which performs a single-shot parameter update to modify the pronunciation of specific words while provably preserving all other model behavior. We first adapt Acoustic Causal Tracing to identify the Transformer layers responsible for text-to-pronunciation mapping. We then apply Null-Space Constrained Editing to compute a closed-form weight update that corrects the target pronunciation while remaining mathematically orthogonal to the subspace governing general speech generation. This constrained update steers the model's acoustic output toward a desired pronunciation exemplar while guaranteeing zero first-order change on a preserved speech corpus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Preethi Seshadri, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Ayomide Odumakinde, Sameer Singh, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic benchmarks increasingly rely on LLM-simulated users to scalably evaluate agent performance, yet the robustness, validity, and fairness of this approach remain unexamined. Through a user study with participants across the United States, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, we investigate whether LLM-simulated users serve as reliable proxies for real human users in evaluating agents on {\tau}-Bench retail tasks. We find that user simulation lacks robustness, with agent success rates varying up to 9 percentage points across different user LLMs. Furthermore, evaluations using simulated users exhibit systematic miscalibration, underestimating agent performance on challenging tasks and overestimating it on moderately difficult ones. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speakers experience consistently worse success rates and calibration errors than Standard American English (SAE) speakers, with disparities compounding significantly with age. We also find simulated users to be a differentially effective proxy for different populations, performing worst for AAVE and Indian English speakers. Additionally, simulated users introduce conversational artifacts and surface different failure patterns than human users. These findings demonstrate that current evaluation practices risk misrepresenting agent capabilities across diverse user populations and may obscure real-world deployment challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Koren, Rafael Moschopoulos, Kira Radinsky, Elad Hazan</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern complex systems, yet neural operators often struggle to efficiently capture the long-range, nonlocal interactions inherent in their solution maps. We introduce Spectral Filtering Operator (SFO), a neural operator that parameterizes integral kernels using the Universal Spectral Basis (USB), a fixed, global orthonormal basis derived from the eigenmodes of the Hilbert matrix in spectral filtering theory. Motivated by our theoretical finding that the discrete Green's functions of shift-invariant PDE discretizations exhibit spatial Linear Dynamical System (LDS) structure, we prove that these kernels admit compact approximations in the USB. By learning only the spectral coefficients of rapidly decaying eigenvalues, SFO achieves a highly efficient representation. Across six benchmarks, including reaction-diffusion, fluid dynamics, and 3D electromagnetics, SFO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing error by up to 40% relative to strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ole St\"uven, Keno Moenck, Thorsten Sch\"uppstuhl</p>
<p>Abstract: ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) is a feature extraction algorithm created for Time Series Classification (TSC), published in 2019. It applies convolution with randomly generated kernels on a time series, producing features that can be used to train a linear classifier or regressor like Ridge. At the time of publication, ROCKET was on par with the best state-of-the-art algorithms for TSC in terms of accuracy while being significantly less computationally expensive, making ROCKET a compelling algorithm for TSC. This also led to several subsequent versions, further improving accuracy and computational efficiency. The currently available ROCKET implementations are mostly bound to execution on CPU. However, convolution is a task that can be highly parallelized and is therefore suited to be executed on GPU, which speeds up the computation significantly. A key difficulty arises from the inhomogeneous kernels ROCKET uses, making standard methods for applying convolution on GPU inefficient. In this work, we propose an algorithm that is able to efficiently perform ROCKET on GPU and achieves up to 11 times higher computational efficiency per watt than ROCKET on CPU. The code for CUROCKET is available in this repository https://github.com/oleeven/CUROCKET on github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olha Sirikova, Alvin Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Comparing neural network representations is essential for understanding and validating models in scientific applications. Existing methods, however, often provide a limited view. We propose the Triangle of Similarity, a framework that combines three complementary perspectives: static representational similarity (CKA/Procrustes), functional similarity (Linear Mode Connectivity or Predictive Similarity), and sparsity similarity (robustness under pruning). Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core. This framework offers a more holistic approach for assessing whether models have converged on similar internal mechanisms, providing a useful tool for model selection and analysis in scientific research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junichiro Niimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent text, yet whether they truly understand the world or merely produce plausible language about it remains contested. We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusheng Du, Athiwat Kongkaeo, Ye Zhang, Haoran Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: For architectural design, representation across multiple Levels of Details (LoD) is essential for achieving a smooth transition from conceptual massing to detailed modeling. However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueqing Hu, Xinyang Peng, Yukun Zhao, Lin Qiu, Ka-lai Hung, Kaiping Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent scholarship typically characterizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through either an \textit{Instrumental Paradigm} (viewing models as reflections of their developers' culture) or a \textit{Substitutive Paradigm} (viewing models as bilingual proxies that switch cultural frames based on language). This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human culture but exhibit an emergent Machine Culture -- a probabilistic phenomenon shaped by \textit{superposition} in high-dimensional space and \textit{mode collapse} from safety alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianxin Luan, Chengsi Liang, Jie Huang, Zheng Lin, Kaitao Meng, John Thompson, Cheng-Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Mamba-assisted neural network framework incorporating self-attention mechanism to achieve improved channel estimation with low complexity for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, particularly for configurations with a large number of subcarriers. With the integration of customized Mamba architecture, the proposed framework handles large-scale subcarrier channel estimation efficiently while capturing long-distance dependencies among these subcarriers effectively. Unlike conventional Mamba structure, this paper implements a bidirectional selective scan to improve channel estimation performance, because channel gains at different subcarriers are non-causal. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits relatively lower space complexity than transformer-based neural networks. Simulation results tested on the 3GPP TS 36.101 channel demonstrate that compared to other baseline neural network solutions, the proposed method achieves improved channel estimation performance with a reduced number of tunable parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Health information seeking has fundamentally changed since the onset of Large Language Models (LLM), with nearly one third of ChatGPT's 800 million users asking health questions weekly. Understanding the sources of those AI generated responses is vital, as health organizations and providers are also investing in digital strategies to organically improve their ranking, reach and visibility in LLM systems like ChatGPT. As AI search optimization strategies are gaining maturity, this study introduces an Authority Signals Framework, organized in four domains that reflect key components to health information seeking, starting with "Who wrote it?" (Author Credentials), followed by "Who published it?" (Institutional Affiliation), "How was it vetted?" (Quality Assurance), and "How does AI find it?" (Digital Authority). This descriptive cross-sectional study randomly selected 100 questions from HealthSearchQA which contains 3,173 consumer health questions curated by Google Research from publicly available search engine suggestions. Those questions were entered into ChatGPT 5.2 Pro to record and code the cited sources through the lens of the Authority Signals Framework's four domains. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all cited sources (n=615), and cross tabulations were conducted to examine distinction among organization types. Over 75% of the sources cited in ChatGPT's health generated responses were from established institutional sources, such as Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Wikipedia, National Health Service, PubMed with the remaining citations sourced from alternative health information sources that lacked established institutional backing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate short-term energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient power grid management, resource allocation, and market stability. Traditional time-series models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies and external factors affecting energy demand. In this study, we propose a forecasting approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our methodology integrates historical energy consumption data with external variables, including temperature, humidity, and time-based features. The LSTM model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset, and its performance is compared against a conventional feed-forward neural network baseline. Experimental results show that the LSTM model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in providing reliable and precise short-term energy forecasts for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Shrey Pandit, Austin Xu, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are typically pre-trained with explicit load-balancing constraints to ensure statistically balanced expert routing. Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inderjeet Singh, Eleonore Vissol-Gaudin, Andikan Otung, Motoyoshi Sekiya</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) and vision-language model (VLM) debate systems employ specialized roles for complex problem-solving, yet model specializations are not leveraged to decide which model should fill which role. We propose dynamic role assignment, a framework that runs a Meta-Debate to select suitable agents before the actual debate. The meta-debate has two stages: (1) proposal, where candidates provide role-tailored arguments, and (2) peer review, where proposals are scored with data and role-specific criteria to choose the best agent for each position. We evaluate our method on LLM problem solving benchmarks. Applied on top of existing debate systems, our approach consistently outperforms uniform assignments (filling all roles with the same model) by up to 74.8% and random assignments (assigning models to roles without considering their suitability) by up to 29.7%, depending on the task and the specific assignment. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-agent system design, shifting from static agent deployment to dynamic and capability-aware selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intent detection, a fundamental text classification task, aims to identify and label the semantics of user queries, playing a vital role in numerous business applications. Despite the dominance of deep learning techniques in this field, the internal mechanisms enabling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve intent detection tasks are poorly understood. In this work, we apply dynamical systems theory to analyze how RNN architectures address this problem, using both the balanced SNIPS and the imbalanced ATIS datasets. By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent. The application of this framework to the imbalanced ATIS dataset then reveals how this ideal geometric solution is distorted by class imbalance, causing the clusters for low-frequency intents to degrade. Our framework decouples geometric separation from readout alignment, providing a novel, mechanistic explanation for real world performance disparities. These findings provide new insights into RNN dynamics, offering a geometric interpretation of how dataset properties directly shape a network's computational solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghan Jung, Bogyeong Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a data-driven information-theoretic framework for sharp partial identification of causal effects under unmeasured confounding. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as bounded or discrete outcomes; require external inputs (for example, instrumental variables, proxies, or user-specified sensitivity parameters); necessitate full structural causal model specifications; or focus solely on population-level averages while neglecting covariate-conditional treatment effects. We overcome all four limitations simultaneously by establishing novel information-theoretic, data-driven divergence bounds. Our key theoretical contribution shows that the f-divergence between the observational distribution P(Y | A = a, X = x) and the interventional distribution P(Y | do(A = a), X = x) is upper bounded by a function of the propensity score alone. This result enables sharp partial identification of conditional causal effects directly from observational data, without requiring external sensitivity parameters, auxiliary variables, full structural specifications, or outcome boundedness assumptions. For practical implementation, we develop a semiparametric estimator satisfying Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which ensures square-root-n consistent inference even when nuisance functions are estimated using flexible machine learning methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications, implemented in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yonghanjung/Information-Theretic-Bounds), demonstrate that our framework provides tight and valid causal bounds across a wide range of data-generating processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panpan Chen, Seonyeong Park, Gangwon Jeong, Refik Mert Cam, Umberto Villa, Mark A. Anastasio</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image reconstruction methods for photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) have developed rapidly in recent years. However, most existing methods have not employed standardized datasets, and their evaluations rely on traditional image quality (IQ) metrics that may lack clinical relevance. The absence of a standardized framework for clinically meaningful IQ assessment hinders fair comparison and raises concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of reported advancements in PACT. A benchmarking framework is proposed that provides open-source, anatomically plausible synthetic datasets and evaluation strategies for DL-based acoustic inversion methods in PACT. The datasets each include over 11,000 two-dimensional (2D) stochastic breast objects with clinically relevant lesions and paired measurements at varying modeling complexity. The evaluation strategies incorporate both traditional and task-based IQ measures to assess fidelity and clinical utility. A preliminary benchmarking study is conducted to demonstrate the framework's utility by comparing DL-based and physics-based reconstruction methods. The benchmarking study demonstrated that the proposed framework enabled comprehensive, quantitative comparisons of reconstruction performance and revealed important limitations in certain DL-based methods. Although they performed well according to traditional IQ measures, they often failed to accurately recover lesions. This highlights the inadequacy of traditional metrics and motivates the need for task-based assessments. The proposed benchmarking framework enables systematic comparisons of DL-based acoustic inversion methods for 2D PACT. By integrating clinically relevant synthetic datasets with rigorous evaluation protocols, it enables reproducible, objective assessments and facilitates method development and system optimization in PACT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tunazzina Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating personalized, persuasive text at scale, raising new questions about bias and fairness in automated communication. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering systems are typically evaluated on factual correctness, yet many real-world applications-such as education and career guidance-require mentorship: responses that provide reflection and guidance. Existing QA benchmarks rarely capture this distinction, particularly in multilingual and long-form settings. We introduce MentorQA, the first multilingual dataset and evaluation framework for mentorship-focused question answering from long-form videos, comprising nearly 9,000 QA pairs from 180 hours of content across four languages. We define mentorship-focused evaluation dimensions that go beyond factual accuracy, capturing clarity, alignment, and learning value. Using MentorQA, we compare Single-Agent, Dual-Agent, RAG, and Multi-Agent QA architectures under controlled conditions. Multi-Agent pipelines consistently produce higher-quality mentorship responses, with especially strong gains for complex topics and lower-resource languages. We further analyze the reliability of automated LLM-based evaluation, observing substantial variation in alignment with human judgments. Overall, this work establishes mentorship-focused QA as a distinct research problem and provides a multilingual benchmark for studying agentic architectures and evaluation design in educational AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saideep Sreekumar, Zeng Wang, Akashdeep Saha, Weihua Xiao, Minghao Shao, Muhammad Shafique, Ozgur Sinanoglu, Ramesh Karri, Johann Knechtel</p>
<p>Abstract: Hardware Trojans (HTs) remain a critical threat because learning-based detectors often overfit to narrow trigger/payload patterns and small, stylized benchmarks. We introduce TrojanGYM, an agentic, LLM-driven framework that automatically curates HT insertions to expose detector blind spots while preserving design correctness. Given high-level HT specifications, a suite of cooperating LLM agents (instantiated with GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3-70B, and Gemini-2.5Pro) proposes and refines RTL modifications that realize diverse triggers and payloads without impacting normal functionality. TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks. Post peer-review, we will release all codes and artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In\'es Gonzalez-Pepe, Vinuyan Sivakolunthu, Jacob Fortin, Yohan Chatelain, Tristan Glatard</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models for neuroimaging increasingly rely on large architectures, making efficiency a persistent concern despite advances in hardware. Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative & Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance. Overall, these methods demonstrate that numerical uncertainty can be exploited to reduce redundant computation and improve inference efficiency in CNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzam Asad, Junaid Saif Khan, Maria Tariq, Sundus Munir, Muhammad Adnan Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Healthcare institutions have access to valuable patient data that could be of great help in the development of improved diagnostic models, but privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR prevent hospitals from directly sharing data with one another. Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\Sigma_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\Sigma_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\frac{2\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\Sigma_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Aisha Syed, Matthew Andrews, Sean Kennedy</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimiliano Pronesti, Anya Belz, Yufang Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved using outcome-level verification signals, such as unit tests for code or exact-match checks for mathematics. In parallel, process supervision has long been explored as a way to shape the intermediate reasoning behaviour of LLMs, but existing approaches rely on neural judges to score chain-of-thought steps, leaving them vulnerable to opacity, bias, and reward hacking. To address this gap, we introduce Verifiable Process Reward Models (VPRMs), a reinforcement-learning framework in which intermediate reasoning steps are checked by deterministic, rule-based verifiers. We apply VPRMs to risk-of-bias assessment for medical evidence synthesis, a domain where guideline-defined criteria and rule-based decision paths enable programmatic verification of reasoning traces. Across multiple datasets, we find that VPRMs generate reasoning that adheres closely to domain rules and achieve substantially higher coherence between step-level decisions and final labels. Results show that VPRMs achieve up to 20% higher F1 than state-of-the-art models and 6.5% higher than verifiable outcome rewards, with substantial gains in evidence grounding and logical coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Y. Liu, Xanthe Muston, Aditya Joshi, Sebastian Sequoiah-Grayson</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the subjective nature of storytelling, past works on automatic story generation (ASG) have relied on limited ground truths for training and evaluation. In this work, we explore reinforcement learning (d-RLAIF) as a post-training alternative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We first apply Todorov's Theory of Narrative Equilibrium to establish principles that define desirable ASG qualities. We prompt 7B and 14B LLM-as-judge models with our principles to test alignment with human annotators and provide reward signals during d-RLAIF. We use Gemini-3-Flash to evaluate the output of our post-trained models and compare them to human-written stories from the TimeTravel dataset. We show that d-RLAIF offers a viable alternative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT)--producing stories that are more diverse and aligned with human narrative conventions. Our paper demonstrates the promise of reinforcement learning for linguistically grounded post-training for subjective tasks such as ASG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Pollanen</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is often tuned as if increasing alignment pressure (controlled by $\beta$) yields progressively "better" behavior. We instead treat $\beta$ as a control parameter and densely sweep it for three 7B open-weight families under a fixed DPO recipe. In Mistral, capability is sharply non-monotonic: aggregated logic-probe margins become positive only in a narrow band near $\beta \approx 10^{-2}$ and revert outside it, with boundary points that are seed-sensitive. Across architectures under the same sweep, we observe qualitatively different response modes: sharp reorganization in Mistral, selective changes in Llama, and smooth trade-offs in Qwen. Critically, the DPO preference margin can anticorrelate with reasoning capability (Pearson $r=-0.91$ for Llama logic), so margin-based selection can prefer capability-impaired models. Training path also matters: exposure to high $\beta$ induces capability losses that persist even after $\beta$ is reduced (hysteresis). These findings motivate capability-resolved evaluation across the $\beta$ landscape rather than reliance on margins or aggregate benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianlei Shan, Han Chen, Yixuan Wang, Zhenjie Liu, Wei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in surface-level text generation, their nature in handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks often remains one of ``statistical fitting'' rather than systematic logical deduction. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to mitigate this by introducing a ``think-before-speak'' paradigm. However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Condrey</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent proposals advocate using keystroke timing signals, specifically the coefficient of variation ($\delta$) of inter-keystroke intervals, to distinguish human-composed text from AI-generated content. We demonstrate that this class of defenses is insecure against two practical attack classes: the copy-type attack, in which a human transcribes LLM-generated text producing authentic motor signals, and timing-forgery attacks, in which automated agents sample inter-keystroke intervals from empirical human distributions. Using 13,000 sessions from the SBU corpus and three timing-forgery variants (histogram sampling, statistical impersonation, and generative LSTM), we show all attacks achieve $\ge$99.8% evasion rates against five classifiers. While detectors achieve AUC=1.000 against fully-automated injection, they classify $\ge$99.8% of attack samples as human with mean confidence $\ge$0.993. We formalize a non-identifiability result: when the detector observes only timing, the mutual information between features and content provenance is zero for copy-type attacks. Although composition and transcription produce statistically distinguishable motor patterns (Cohen's d=1.28), both yield $\delta$ values 2-4x above detection thresholds, rendering the distinction security-irrelevant. These systems confirm a human operated the keyboard, but not whether that human originated the text. Securing provenance requires architectures that bind the writing process to semantic content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaokun Liu, Yifan Liu, Phoebe Mbuvi, Zelin Li, Ruichen Yao, Gawon Lim, Dong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering is severely hampered by ambiguous user queries, a significant safety risk that demonstrably reduces answer accuracy in high-stakes healthcare settings. In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided "Clarify-Before-Answer" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weloday Fikadu Moges, Jianmei Su, Amin Waqas</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep learning models for plant disease detection on edge devices such as IoT sensors, smartphones, and embedded systems is severely constrained by limited computational resources and energy budgets. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Dynamic Meta-Ensemble Framework (DMEF) for high-accuracy plant disease diagnosis under resource constraints. DMEF employs an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically combines the predictions of three lightweight convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3) by optimizing a trade-off between accuracy improvements (DeltaAcc) and computational efficiency (model size). During training, the ensemble weights are updated iteratively, favoring models exhibiting high performance and low complexity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for potato and maize diseases demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 99.53% and 96.61%, respectively, surpassing standalone models and static ensembles by 2.1% and 6.3%. With computationally efficient inference latency (<75ms) and a compact footprint (<1 million parameters), DMEF shows strong potential for edge-based agricultural monitoring, suggesting viability for scalable crop disease management. This bridges the gap between high-accuracy AI and practical field applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samaresh Kumar Singh, Joyjit Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: As Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments expand to include tens of thousands of connected devices. The centralization of security monitoring architectures creates serious latency issues that savvy attackers can exploit to compromise an entire manufacturing ecosystem. This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital "immune system" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing. Additionally, the proposed architecture can prevent real-time cascading failures in industrial control systems and reduce network bandwidth use by 89% compared to cloud-based solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving fast and are now frequently used as evaluators, in a process typically referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge, which provides quality assessments of model outputs. However, recent research points out significant vulnerabilities in such evaluation, including sensitivity to prompts, systematic biases, verbosity effects, and unreliable or hallucinated rationales. These limitations motivated the development of a more robust paradigm, dubbed LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge. This survey reviews recent advances in meta-judging and organizes the literature, by introducing a framework along six key perspectives: (i) Conceptual Foundations, (ii) Mechanisms of Meta-Judging, (iii) Alignment Training Methods, (iv) Evaluation, (v) Limitations and Failure Modes, and (vi) Future Directions. By analyzing the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge and summarizing recent advances in meta-judging by LLMs, we argue that LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge offers a promising direction for more stable and trustworthy automated evaluation, while highlighting remaining challenges related to cost, prompt sensitivity, and shared model biases, which must be addressed to advance the next generation of LLM evaluation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Li, Runni Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) grading based on radiographic images is a critical yet challenging task due to subtle inter-grade differences, annotation uncertainty, and the inherently ordinal nature of disease progression. Conventional deep learning approaches typically formulate this problem as deterministic multi-class classification, ignoring both the continuous progression of degeneration and the uncertainty in expert annotations. In this work, we propose ClinNet, a novel trustworthy framework that addresses KOA grading as an evidential ordinal regression problem. The proposed method integrates three key components: (1) a Bilateral Asymmetry Encoder (BAE) that explicitly models medial-lateral structural discrepancies; (2) a Diagnostic Memory Bank that maintains class-wise prototypes to stabilize feature representations; and (3) an Evidential Ordinal Head based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution to jointly estimate continuous KL grades and epistemic uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClinNet achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.892 and Accuracy of 0.768, statistically outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.001). Crucially, we demonstrate that the model's uncertainty estimates successfully flag out-of-distribution samples and potential misdiagnoses, paving the way for safe clinical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference-based alignment like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from pairwise preferences, yet the labels are often noisy and inconsistent. Existing uncertainty-aware approaches weight preferences, but ignore a more fundamental factor: the reliability of the \emph{answers} being compared. To address the problem, we propose Conformal Feedback Alignment (CFA), a framework that grounds preference weighting in the statistical guarantees of Conformal Prediction (CP). CFA quantifies answer-level reliability by constructing conformal prediction sets with controllable coverage and aggregates these reliabilities into principled weights for both DPO- and PPO-style training. Experiments across different datasets show that CFA improves alignment robustness and data efficiency, highlighting that modeling \emph{answer-side} uncertainty complements preference-level weighting and yields more robust, data-efficient alignment.

Using core constructs from natural language processing, search engineering, and vector data models, the proposed system aims to address key challenges in discovering, relevance ranking, data freshness, and entity recognition intrinsic to financial data retrieval. In this work, we detail the unique requirements of NLQ for financial datasets and documents, outline the architectural components for offline indexing and online retrieval, and discuss the real-world use cases of enhanced knowledge search in financial services. We delve into the theoretical underpinnings and experimental evidence supporting our proposed architecture, ultimately providing a comprehensive analysis on the subject matter.

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis. However, there is much improvement room on restoring 3D scenes based on NeRF from corrupted images, which are common in natural scene captures and can significantly impact the effectiveness of NeRF. This paper introduces NeRF-MIR, a novel neural rendering approach specifically proposed for the restoration of masked images, demonstrating the potential of NeRF in this domain. Recognizing that randomly emitting rays to pixels in NeRF may not effectively learn intricate image textures, we propose a \textbf{P}atch-based \textbf{E}ntropy for \textbf{R}ay \textbf{E}mitting (\textbf{PERE}) strategy to distribute emitted rays properly. This enables NeRF-MIR to fuse comprehensive information from images of different views. Additionally, we introduce a \textbf{P}rogressively \textbf{I}terative \textbf{RE}storation (\textbf{PIRE}) mechanism to restore the masked regions in a self-training process. Furthermore, we design a dynamically-weighted loss function that automatically recalibrates the loss weights for masked regions. As existing datasets do not support NeRF-based masked image restoration, we construct three masked datasets to simulate corrupted scenarios. Extensive experiments on real data and constructed datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeRF-MIR over its counterparts in masked image restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Ettori</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models and deep neural networks achieve strong performance but suffer from reliability issues and high computational cost. This thesis proposes a unified framework based on spectral geometry and random matrix theory to address both problems by analyzing the eigenvalue structure of hidden activations. The first contribution, EigenTrack, is a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in language and vision-language models using spectral features and their temporal dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, is a principled compression method that identifies informative spectral components and applies iterative knowledge distillation to produce compact and efficient models while preserving accuracy. Together, these results show that spectral statistics provide interpretable and robust signals for monitoring uncertainty and guiding compression in large-scale neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiankai Jin, Xiangzheng Zhang, Zhao Liu, Deyue Zhang, Quanchen Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems can produce personalized outputs that allow an adversary to infer sensitive input attributes at inference time. We introduce Robust Privacy (RP), an inference-time privacy notion inspired by certified robustness: if a model's prediction is provably invariant within a radius-$R$ neighborhood around an input $x$ (e.g., under the $\ell_2$ norm), then $x$ enjoys $R$-Robust Privacy, i.e., observing the prediction cannot distinguish $x$ from any input within distance $R$ of $x$. We further develop Attribute Privacy Enhancement (APE) to translate input-level invariance into an attribute-level privacy effect. In a controlled recommendation task where the decision depends primarily on a sensitive attribute, we show that RP expands the set of sensitive-attribute values compatible with a positive recommendation, expanding the inference interval accordingly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that RP also mitigates model inversion attacks (MIAs) by masking fine-grained input-output dependence. Even at small noise levels ($\sigma=0.1$), RP reduces the attack success rate (ASR) from 73% to 4% with partial model performance degradation. RP can also partially mitigate MIAs (e.g., ASR drops to 44%) with no model performance degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether readers prefer AI-generated short stories in Italian over one written by a renowned Italian author. In a blind setup, 20 participants read and evaluated three stories, two created with ChatGPT-4o and one by Alberto Moravia, without being informed of their origin. To explore potential influencing factors, reading habits and demographic data, comprising age, gender, education and first language, were also collected. The results showed that the AI-written texts received slightly higher average ratings and were more frequently preferred, although differences were modest. No statistically significant associations were found between text preference and demographic or reading-habit variables. These findings challenge assumptions about reader preference for human-authored fiction and raise questions about the necessity of synthetic-text editing in literary contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study uses Jordanian law as a case study to explore the fine-tuning of the Llama-3.1 large language model for Arabic question-answering. Two versions of the model - Llama-3.1-8B-bnb-4bit and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit - were fine-tuned using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with LoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models, leveraging the Unsloth framework for accelerated and resource-efficient training. A custom dataset of 6000 legal question-answer pairs was curated from Jordanian laws and formatted into structured prompts. Performance was evaluated using the BLEU and the ROUGE metrics to compare the fine-tuned models to their respective base versions. Results demonstrated improved legal reasoning and accuracy while achieving resource efficiency through quantization and optimized fine-tuning strategies. This work underscores the potential of adapting large language models for Arabic legal domains and highlights effective techniques for fine-tuning domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zecheng Tang, Quantong Qiu, Yi Yang, Zhiyi Hong, Haiya Xiang, Kebin Liu, Qingqing Dang, Juntao Li, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms poses a significant scalability bottleneck for large language models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference. Experiments across three long-context benchmarks on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijin Hua, Zichuan Liu, Kun Zhang, Yiyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has been driven primarily by large-scale pre-training, but inference-time compute potential remains largely untapped. This work systematically investigates two questions: how do TSFMs behave under standard sampling-based inference scaling, and can controlled sampling diversity enhance performance? We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget. Overall, our findings clarify these factor interactions, enabling reliable performance via diverse large-scale inference time series in parallel environments without re-training TSFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Zare, Pirooz Shamsinejadbabaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a serious threat to the privacy of machine learning models by allowing adversaries to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the training set. Although federated learning (FL) is widely regarded as a privacy-aware training paradigm due to its decentralized nature, recent evidence shows that the final global model can still leak sensitive membership information through black-box access. In this paper, we introduce Res-MIA, a novel training-free and black-box membership inference attack that exploits the sensitivity of deep models to high-frequency input details. Res-MIA progressively degrades the input resolution using controlled downsampling and restoration operations, and analyzes the resulting confidence decay in the model's predictions. Our key insight is that training samples exhibit a significantly steeper confidence decline under resolution erosion compared to non-member samples, revealing a robust membership signal. Res-MIA requires no shadow models, no auxiliary data, and only a limited number of forward queries to the target model. We evaluate the proposed attack on a federated ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, where it consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines and achieves an AUC of up to 0.88 with minimal computational overhead. These findings highlight frequency-sensitive overfitting as an important and previously underexplored source of privacy leakage in federated learning, and emphasize the need for privacy-aware model designs that reduce reliance on fine-grained, non-robust input features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Trinh, Scott Seidenberger, Joseph Spracklen, Raveen Wijewickrama, Bimal Viswanath, Murtuza Jadliwala, Anindya Maiti</p>
<p>Abstract: The emerging field of AI-generated art has witnessed the rise of prompt marketplaces, where creators can purchase, sell, or share prompts to generate unique artworks. These marketplaces often assert ownership over prompts, claiming them as intellectual property. This paper investigates whether concealed prompts sold on prompt marketplaces can be considered bona fide intellectual property, given that humans and AI tools may be able to infer the prompts based on publicly advertised sample images accompanying each prompt on sale. Specifically, our study aims to assess (i) how accurately humans can infer the original prompt solely by examining an AI-generated image, with the goal of generating images similar to the original image, and (ii) the possibility of improving upon individual human and AI prompt inferences by crafting combined human and AI prompts with the help of a large language model. Although previous research has explored AI-driven prompt inference and protection strategies, our work is the first to incorporate a human subject study and examine collaborative human-AI prompt inference in depth. Our findings indicate that while prompts inferred by humans and prompts inferred through a combined human and AI effort can generate images with a moderate level of similarity, they are not as successful as using the original prompt. Moreover, combining human- and AI-inferred prompts using our suggested merging techniques did not improve performance over purely human-inferred prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Ling, Kai Hu, Hangcheng Liu, Xingshuo Han, Tianwei Zhang, Changhai Ou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world intelligent systems for perception and reasoning in open physical environments. While LVLMs are known to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, existing methods either require access to input channels or depend on knowledge of user queries, assumptions that rarely hold in practical deployments. We propose the first Physical Prompt Injection Attack (PPIA), a black-box, query-agnostic attack that embeds malicious typographic instructions into physical objects perceivable by the LVLM. PPIA requires no access to the model, its inputs, or internal pipeline, and operates solely through visual observation. It combines offline selection of highly recognizable and semantically effective visual prompts with strategic environment-aware placement guided by spatiotemporal attention, ensuring that the injected prompts are both perceivable and influential on model behavior. We evaluate PPIA across 10 state-of-the-art LVLMs in both simulated and real-world settings on tasks including visual question answering, planning, and navigation, PPIA achieves attack success rates up to 98%, with strong robustness under varying physical conditions such as distance, viewpoint, and illumination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ding, Xiu Yan, Chuanlong Xie, Yao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking methods have always been effective means of protecting intellectual property, yet they face significant challenges. Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions. In particular, our method outperforms the stable signature method by an average of 10\% across 12 different image transformations on COCO datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vashista Nobaub</p>
<p>Abstract: Early-stage degradation in oscillatory systems often manifests as geometric distortions of the dynamics, such as phase jitter, frequency drift, or loss of coherence, long before changes in signal energy are detectable. In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real vibration datasets validate the theory, demonstrating earlier detection, improved data efficiency, and robustness to operating condition changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Fang, Jian Li, Wei Chen, Bin Hu, Ying-Cong Chen, Xin Tang, Liang Diao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved rapid progress in Chinese language understanding, yet accurately evaluating their capabilities remains challenged by benchmark saturation and prohibitive computational costs. While static leaderboards provide snapshot rankings, they often mask the structural trade-offs between capabilities. In this work, we present ReLE (Robust Efficient Live Evaluation), a scalable system designed to diagnose Capability Anisotropy, the non-uniformity of model performance across domains. Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples. We introduce two methodological contributions to address current evaluation pitfalls: (1) A Symbolic-Grounded Hybrid Scoring Mechanism that eliminates embedding-based false positives in reasoning tasks; (2) A Dynamic Variance-Aware Scheduler based on Neyman allocation with noise correction, which reduces compute costs by 70\% compared to full-pass evaluations while maintaining a ranking correlation of $\rho=0.96$. Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior. We position ReLE not as a replacement for comprehensive static benchmarks, but as a high-frequency diagnostic monitor for the evolving model landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) is the clinical reference standard for assessing coronary artery disease, yet quantitative analysis is limited by the difficulty of robust vessel segmentation in routine data. Low contrast, motion, foreshortening, overlap, and catheter confounding degrade segmentation and contribute to domain shift across centers. Reliable segmentation, together with vessel-type labeling, enables vessel-specific coronary analytics and downstream measurements that depend on anatomical localization. From 670 cine sequences (407 subjects), we select a best frame near peak opacification using a low-intensity histogram criterion and apply joint super-resolution and enhancement. We benchmark classical Meijering, Frangi, and Sato vesselness filters under per-image oracle tuning, a single global mean setting, and per-image parameter prediction via Support Vector Regression (SVR). Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006. On DCA1 as a strict external test, Dice drops to 0.798 (coronary-only) and 0.814 (merged), while light in-domain fine-tuning recovers to 0.881+/-0.014 and 0.882+/-0.015. Vessel-type labeling achieves 98.5% accuracy (Dice 0.844) for RCA, 95.4% (0.786) for LAD, and 96.2% (0.794) for LCX. Learned per-image tuning strengthens classical pipelines, while high-resolution FPN models and merged-label supervision improve stability and external transfer with modest adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H. Kemal \.Ilter</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific writing promises efficiency but risks introducing informational entropy. While "hallucinated papers" are a known artifact, the systematic degradation of valid citation chains remains unquantified. We conducted a forensic audit of 50 recent survey papers in Artificial Intelligence (N=5,514 citations) published between September 2024 and January 2026. We utilized a hybrid verification pipeline combining DOI resolution, Crossref metadata analysis, Semantic Scholar queries, and fuzzy text matching to distinguish between formatting errors ("Sloppiness") and verifiable non-existence ("Phantoms). We detect a persistent 17.0% Phantom Rate -- citations that cannot be resolved to any digital object despite aggressive forensic recovery. Diagnostic categorization reveals three distinct failure modes: pure hallucinations (5.1%), hallucinated identifiers with valid titles (16.4%), and parsing-induced matching failures (78.5%). Longitudinal analysis reveals a flat trend (+0.07 pp/month), suggesting that high-entropy citation practices have stabilized as an endemic feature of the field. The scientific citation graph in AI survey literature exhibits "link rot" at scale. This suggests a mechanism where AI tools act as "lazy research assistants," retrieving correct titles but hallucinating metadata, thereby severing the digital chain of custody required for reproducible science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Jesus Rodriguez-Sanchez, Manuel Noguera, Angel Ruiz-Zafra, Kawtar Benghazi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of increasingly complex agentic and multi-agent systems capable of planning, tool use and task decomposition. However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: On-device large language models commonly employ task-specific adapters (e.g., LoRAs) to deliver strong performance on downstream tasks. While storing all available adapters is impractical due to memory constraints, mobile devices typically have sufficient capacity to store a limited number of these parameters. This raises a critical challenge: how to select representative adapters that generalize well across multiple tasks - a problem that remains unexplored in existing literature. We propose a novel method D2C for adapter clustering that leverages minimal task-specific examples (e.g., 10 per task) and employs an iterative optimization process to refine cluster assignments. The adapters within each cluster are merged, creating multi-task adapters deployable on resource-constrained devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively boosts performance for considered storage budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ondrej Bohdal, Pramit Saha, Umberto Michieli, Mete Ozay, Taha Ceritli</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often rely on user-specific memories distilled from past interactions to enable personalized generation. A common practice is to concatenate these memories with the input prompt, but this approach quickly exhausts the limited context available in on-device LLMs. Compressing memories by averaging can mitigate context growth, yet it frequently harms performance due to semantic conflicts across heterogeneous memories. In this work, we introduce a clustering-based memory compression strategy that balances context efficiency and personalization quality. Our method groups memories by similarity and merges them within clusters prior to concatenation, thereby preserving coherence while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers the number of memory tokens while outperforming baseline strategies such as naive averaging or direct concatenation. Furthermore, for a fixed context budget, clustering-driven merging yields more compact memory representations and consistently enhances generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Centralized value learning is often assumed to improve coordination and stability in multi-agent reinforcement learning, yet this assumption is rarely tested under controlled conditions. We directly evaluate it in a fully tabular predator-prey gridworld by comparing independent and centralized Q-learning under explicit embodiment constraints on agent speed and stamina. Across multiple kinematic regimes and asymmetric agent roles, centralized learning fails to provide a consistent advantage and is frequently outperformed by fully independent learning, even under full observability and exact value estimation. Moreover, asymmetric centralized-independent configurations induce persistent coordination breakdowns rather than transient learning instability. By eliminating confounding effects from function approximation and representation learning, our tabular analysis isolates coordination structure as the primary driver of these effects. The results show that increased coordination can become a liability under embodiment constraints, and that the effectiveness of centralized learning is fundamentally regime and role dependent rather than universal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on sensitive datasets carries a substantial risk of unintended memorization and leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which can violate privacy regulations and compromise individual safety. In this work, we systematically investigate a critical and underexplored vulnerability: the exposure of PII that appears only in model inputs, not in training targets. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we design controlled extraction probes to quantify unintended PII memorization and study how factors such as language, PII frequency, task type, and model size influence memorization behavior. We further benchmark four privacy-preserving approaches including differential privacy, machine unlearning, regularization, and preference alignment, evaluating their trade-offs between privacy and task performance. Our results show that post-training methods generally provide more consistent privacy-utility trade-offs, while differential privacy achieves strong reduction in leakage in specific settings, although it can introduce training instability. These findings highlight the persistent challenge of memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and emphasize the need for robust, scalable privacy-preserving techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Training modern neural networks is increasingly fragile, with rare but severe destabilizing updates often causing irreversible divergence or silent performance degradation. Existing optimization methods primarily rely on preventive mechanisms embedded within the optimizer, offering limited ability to detect and recover from instability once it occurs. We introduce a supervisory runtime stability framework that treats optimization as a controlled stochastic process. By isolating an innovation signal derived from secondary measurements, such as validation probes, the framework enables automatic detection and recovery from destabilizing updates without modifying the underlying optimizer. We provide theoretical runtime safety guarantees that formalize bounded degradation and recovery. Our implementation incurs minimal overhead and is compatible with memory-constrained training settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyu Zhang, Lin Nie, Wai-Fung Lam, Qihao Wang, Xin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In many deployed systems, new text inputs are handled by retrieving similar past cases, for example when routing and responding to citizen messages in digital governance platforms. When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David L. Donoho, Jian Kang, Xihong Lin, Bhramar Mukherjee, Dan Nettleton, Rebecca Nugent, Abel Rodriguez, Eric P. Xing, Tian Zheng, Hongtu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This article presents the full, original record of the 2024 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) town hall, "Statistics in the Age of AI," which convened leading statisticians to discuss how the field is evolving in response to advances in artificial intelligence, foundation models, large-scale empirical modeling, and data-intensive infrastructures. The town hall was structured around open panel discussion and extensive audience Q&A, with the aim of eliciting candid, experience-driven perspectives rather than formal presentations or prepared statements. This document preserves the extended exchanges among panelists and audience members, with minimal editorial intervention, and organizes the conversation around five recurring questions concerning disciplinary culture and practices, data curation and "data work," engagement with modern empirical modeling, training for large-scale AI applications, and partnerships with key AI stakeholders. By providing an archival record of this discussion, the preprint aims to support transparency, community reflection, and ongoing dialogue about the evolving role of statistics in the data- and AI-centric future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Xiangchen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs increasingly function as economic agents, the specific mechanisms LLMs use to update their belief with heterogeneous signals remain opaque. We design experiments and develop a Behavioral Kalman Filter framework to quantify how LLM-based agents update expectations, acting as households or firm CEOs, update expectations when presented with individual and aggregate signals. The results from experiments and model estimation reveal four consistent patterns: (1) agents' weighting of priors and signals deviates from unity; (2) both household and firm CEO agents place substantially larger weights on individual signals compared to aggregate signals; (3) we identify a significant and negative interaction between concurrent signals, implying that the presence of multiple information sources diminishes the marginal weight assigned to each individual signal; and (4) expectation formation patterns differ significantly between household and firm CEO agents. Finally, we demonstrate that LoRA fine-tuning mitigates, but does not fully eliminate, behavioral biases in LLM expectation formation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Song, Yizhi Zhou, Xiangyu Kong, Jiulong Jiao, Xinrui Bao, Xu You, Xueqing Shi, Yuhang Zhou, Heng Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models with external evidence, but under a limited context budget, the key challenge is deciding which retrieved passages should be injected. We show that retrieval relevance metrics (e.g., NDCG) correlate weakly with end-to-end QA quality and can even become negatively correlated under multi-passage injection, where redundancy and mild conflicts destabilize generation. We propose \textbf{Information Gain Pruning (IGP)}, a deployment-friendly reranking-and-pruning module that selects evidence using a generator-aligned utility signal and filters weak or harmful passages before truncation, without changing existing budget interfaces. Across five open-domain QA benchmarks and multiple retrievers and generators, IGP consistently improves the quality--cost trade-off. In a representative multi-evidence setting, IGP delivers about +12--20% relative improvement in average F1 while reducing final-stage input tokens by roughly 76--79% compared to retriever-only baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silong Chen, Yuchuan Luo, Guilin Deng, Yi Liu, Min Xu, Shaojing Fu, Xiaohua Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapter-based Federated Large Language Models (FedLLMs) are widely adopted to reduce the computational, storage, and communication overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning for web-scale applications while preserving user privacy. By freezing the backbone and training only compact low-rank adapters, these methods appear to limit gradient leakage and thwart existing Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs).
  Contrary to this assumption, we show that low-rank adapters create new, exploitable leakage channels. We propose the Unordered-word-bag-based Text Reconstruction (UTR) attack, a novel GIA tailored to the unique structure of adapter-based FedLLMs. UTR overcomes three core challenges: low-dimensional gradients, frozen backbones, and combinatorially large reconstruction spaces by: (i) inferring token presence from attention patterns in frozen layers, (ii) performing sentence-level inversion within the low-rank subspace of adapter gradients, and (iii) enforcing semantic coherence through constrained greedy decoding guided by language priors. Extensive experiments across diverse models (GPT2-Large, BERT, Qwen2.5-7B) and datasets (CoLA, SST-2, Rotten Tomatoes) demonstrate that UTR achieves near-perfect reconstruction accuracy (ROUGE-1/2 > 99), even with large batch size settings where prior GIAs fail completely. Our results reveal a fundamental tension between parameter efficiency and privacy in FedLLMs, challenging the prevailing belief that lightweight adaptation inherently enhances security.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Narek Maloyan, Dmitry Namiot</p>
<p>Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a de facto standard for integrating Large Language Models with external tools, yet no formal security analysis of the protocol specification exists. We present the first rigorous security analysis of MCP's architectural design, identifying three fundamental protocol-level vulnerabilities: (1) absence of capability attestation allowing servers to claim arbitrary permissions, (2) bidirectional sampling without origin authentication enabling server-side prompt injection, and (3) implicit trust propagation in multi-server configurations. We implement \textsc{MCPBench}, a novel framework bridging existing agent security benchmarks to MCP-compliant infrastructure, enabling direct measurement of protocol-specific attack surfaces. Through controlled experiments on 847 attack scenarios across five MCP server implementations, we demonstrate that MCP's architectural choices amplify attack success rates by 23--41\% compared to equivalent non-MCP integrations. We propose \textsc{MCPSec}, a backward-compatible protocol extension adding capability attestation and message authentication, reducing attack success rates from 52.8\% to 12.4\% with median latency overhead of 8.3ms per message. Our findings establish that MCP's security weaknesses are architectural rather than implementation-specific, requiring protocol-level remediation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Gavenski, Matteo Leonetti, Odinaldo Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art imitation learning from observation methods (ILfO) have recently made significant progress, but they still have some limitations: they need action-based supervised optimisation, assume that states have a single optimal action, and tend to apply teacher actions without full consideration of the actual environment state. While the truth may be out there in observed trajectories, existing methods struggle to extract it without supervision. In this work, we propose Unsupervised Imitation Learning from Observation (UfO) that addresses all of these limitations. UfO learns a policy through a two-stage process, in which the agent first obtains an approximation of the teacher's true actions in the observed state transitions, and then refines the learned policy further by adjusting agent trajectories to closely align them with the teacher's. Experiments we conducted in five widely used environments show that UfO not only outperforms the teacher and all other ILfO methods but also displays the smallest standard deviation. This reduction in standard deviation indicates better generalisation in unseen scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijing Hui, Wenhan Lyu, Shusen Wang, Li Chen, Chu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Trending news detection in low-traffic search environments faces a fundamental cold-start problem, where a lack of query volume prevents systems from identifying emerging or long-tail trends. Existing methods relying on keyword frequency or query spikes are inherently slow and ineffective in these sparse settings, lagging behind real-world shifts in attention. We introduce RTTP, a novel Real-Time Trending Prediction framework that generates search queries directly from news content instead of waiting for users to issue them. RTTP leverages a continual learning LLM (CL-LLM) that converts posts into search-style queries and scores them using engagement strength + creator authority, enabling early trend surfacing before search volume forms. To ensure adaptation without degrading reasoning, we propose Mix-Policy DPO, a new preference-based continual learning approach that combines on-policy stability with off-policy novelty to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during model upgrades. Deployed at production scale on Facebook and Meta AI products, RTTP delivers +91.4% improvement in tail-trend detection precision@500 and +19% query generation accuracy over industry baselines, while sustaining stable performance after multi-week online training. This work demonstrates that LLM-generated synthetic search signals, when aligned and continually updated, unlock timely trend understanding in low-traffic search environments.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17569">Improving User Privacy in Personalized Generation: Client-Side Retrieval-Augmented Modification of Server-Side Generated Speculations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Salemi, Hamed Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalization is crucial for aligning Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with individual user preferences and background knowledge. State-of-the-art solutions are based on retrieval augmentation, where relevant context from a user profile is retrieved for LLM consumption. These methods deal with a trade-off between exposing retrieved private data to cloud providers and relying on less capable local models. We introduce $P^3$, an interactive framework for high-quality personalization without revealing private profiles to server-side LLMs. In $P^3$, a large server-side model generates a sequence of $k$ draft tokens based solely on the user query, while a small client-side model, with retrieval access to the user's private profile, evaluates and modifies these drafts to better reflect user preferences. This process repeats until an end token is generated. Experiments on LaMP-QA, a recent benchmark consisting of three personalized question answering datasets, show that $P^3$ consistently outperforms both non-personalized server-side and personalized client-side baselines, achieving statistically significant improvements of $7.4%$ to $9%$ on average. Importantly, $P^3$ recovers $90.3%$ to $95.7%$ of the utility of a ``leaky'' upper-bound scenario in which the full profile is exposed to the large server-side model. Privacy analyses, including linkability and attribute inference attacks, indicate that $P^3$ preserves the privacy of a non-personalized server-side model, introducing only marginal additional leakage ($1.5%$--$3.5%$) compared to submitting a query without any personal context. Additionally, the framework is efficient for edge deployment, with the client-side model generating only $9.2%$ of the total tokens. These results demonstrate that $P^3$ provides a practical, effective solution for personalized generation with improved privacy.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17577">Status Hierarchies in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilio Barkett</p>
<p>Abstract: From school playgrounds to corporate boardrooms, status hierarchies -- rank orderings based on respect and perceived competence -- are universal features of human social organization. Language models trained on human-generated text inevitably encounter these hierarchical patterns embedded in language, raising the question of whether they might reproduce such dynamics in multi-agent settings. This thesis investigates when and how language models form status hierarchies by adapting Berger et al.'s (1972) expectation states framework. I create multi-agent scenarios where separate language model instances complete sentiment classification tasks, are introduced with varying status characteristics (e.g., credentials, expertise), then have opportunities to revise their initial judgments after observing their partner's responses. The dependent variable is deference, the rate at which models shift their ratings toward their partner's position based on status cues rather than task information. Results show that language models form significant status hierarchies when capability is equal (35 percentage point asymmetry, p < .001), but capability differences dominate status cues, with the most striking effect being that high-status assignments reduce higher-capability models' deference rather than increasing lower-capability models' deference. The implications for AI safety are significant: status-seeking behavior could introduce deceptive strategies, amplify discriminatory biases, and scale across distributed deployments far faster than human hierarchies form organically. This work identifies emergent social behaviors in AI systems and highlights a previously underexplored dimension of the alignment challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly acting as autonomous contributors by generating and submitting pull requests (PRs). However, we lack empirical evidence on how these agent-generated PRs differ from human contributions, particularly in how they modify code and describe their changes. Understanding these differences is essential for assessing their reliability and impact on development workflows. Using the MSR 2026 Mining Challenge version of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 24,014 merged Agentic PRs (440,295 commits) and 5,081 merged Human PRs (23,242 commits). We examine additions, deletions, commits, and files touched, and evaluate the consistency between PR descriptions and their diffs using lexical and semantic similarity. Agentic PRs differ substantially from Human PRs in commit count (Cliff's $\delta = 0.5429$) and show moderate differences in files touched and deleted lines. They also exhibit slightly higher description-to-diff similarity across all measures. These findings provide a large-scale empirical characterization of how AI coding agents contribute to open source development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biomolecular networks underpin emerging technologies in synthetic biology-from robust biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering to smart therapeutics and cell-based diagnostics-and also provide a mechanistic language for understanding complex dynamics in natural and ecological systems. Yet designing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement a desired dynamical function remains largely manual: while a proposed network can be checked by simulation, the reverse problem of discovering a network from a behavioral specification is difficult, requiring substantial human insight to navigate a vast space of topologies and kinetic parameters with nonlinear and possibly stochastic dynamics. Here we introduce GenAI-Net, a generative AI framework that automates CRN design by coupling an agent that proposes reactions to simulation-based evaluation defined by a user-specified objective. GenAI-Net efficiently produces novel, topologically diverse solutions across multiple design tasks, including dose responses, complex logic gates, classifiers, oscillators, and robust perfect adaptation in deterministic and stochastic settings (including noise reduction). By turning specifications into families of circuit candidates and reusable motifs, GenAI-Net provides a general route to programmable biomolecular circuit design and accelerates the translation from desired function to implementable mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Samir Fayed, Ahmed Samir Fayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in software development, yet their ability to generate and maintain large, multi module systems through natural language interaction remains insufficiently characterized. This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment. By combining quantitative prompt analysis with qualitative assessment of model behaviour, this study provides empirical evidence that modern LLMs can sustain architectural coherence and support the construction of production grade tooling for emerging programming languages, highlighting prompt driven development as a viable methodology within software engineering practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suborno Deb Bappon, Saikat Mondal, Chanchal K. Roy, Kevin Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support software developers in tasks such as code generation, optimization, and documentation. However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based neural decoders with large parameter counts, pre-trained on large-scale datasets, have recently outperformed classical machine learning models and small neural networks on brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks. However, their large parameter counts and high computational demands hinder deployment in power-constrained implantable systems. To address this challenge, we introduce BrainDistill, a novel implantable motor decoding pipeline that integrates an implantable neural decoder (IND) with a task-specific knowledge distillation (TSKD) framework. Unlike standard feature distillation methods that attempt to preserve teacher representations in full, TSKD explicitly prioritizes features critical for decoding through supervised projection. Across multiple neural datasets, IND consistently outperforms prior neural decoders on motor decoding tasks, while its TSKD-distilled variant further surpasses alternative distillation methods in few-shot calibration settings. Finally, we present a quantization-aware training scheme that enables integer-only inference with activation clipping ranges learned during training. The quantized IND enables deployment under the strict power constraints of implantable BCIs with minimal performance loss.</p>

In particular, while mRAG provides a practical capability to connect private datasets to improve model performance, it risks the leakage of private information from these datasets during inference. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to analyze the privacy risks inherent in the mRAG pipeline observed through standard model prompting. Specifically, we implement a case study that attempts to infer the inclusion of a visual asset, e.g. image, in the mRAG, and if present leak the metadata, e.g. caption, related to it. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms and motivate future research on mRAG privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akila Sampath, Vandana Janeja, Jianwu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying the causal relationship between ice melt and freshwater distribution is critical, as these complex interactions manifest as regional fluctuations in sea surface height (SSH). Leveraging SSH as a proxy for sea ice dynamics enables improved understanding of the feedback mechanisms driving polar climate change and global sea-level rise. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle with reliable treatment effect estimation in spatiotemporal settings due to unobserved confounders and the absence of physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-Guided Causal Model Variational Autoencoder (KGCM-VAE) to quantify causal mechanisms between sea ice thickness and SSH. The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments. In addition, the model incorporates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance treated and control covariate distributions in the latent space, along with a causal adjacency-constrained decoder to ensure alignment with established physical structures. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world Arctic datasets demonstrate that KGCM-VAE achieves superior PEHE compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the approach, showing that the joint application of MMD and causal adjacency constraints yields a 1.88\% reduction in estimation error.</p>

We curate a 33GB Urdu corpus from diverse sources, develop a custom BPE tokenizer that reduces tokenization overhead by atleast 20-30% compared to multilingual alternatives, and pretrain a 100M-parameter decoder-only model. In few-shot evaluations, UrduLM achieves competitive performance with multilingual models up to 30x its size, reaching 66.6% accuracy on sentiment classification and BLEU scores exceeding 30 on grammar correction tasks. The complete methodology -- including corpus, tokenizer, model weights, and evaluation benchmarks -- is released openly to establish a baseline for Urdu NLP research and provide a scalable framework for other underrepresented languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Rossi, Steven D. Prestwich</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates generative mathematical programming through the lens of Algebraic Modelling Languages (AMLs) and compiler-guided model synthesis. By leveraging PyOPL, an OPL-like AML compiler that provides detailed syntax diagnostics, we introduce SyntAGM, an end-to-end system that translates natural language problem descriptions into PyOPL models via a generate--compile--assess--revise loop. SyntAGM is grammar-aware thanks to in-context exposure to the PyOPL BNF grammar, and benefits from few-shot retrieval of literate PyOPL model exemplars. To obtain a valid PyOPL model that matches the problem description, SyntAGM mobilises compiler feedback and an LLM-based alignment judge. In a comparative study against established prompting baselines SyntAGM achieves competitive accuracy with superior token, cost, and latency profiles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyu Zhang, Yuan Hu, Yong Li, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified remote sensing multimodal models exhibit a pronounced spatial reversal curse: Although they can accurately recognize and describe object locations in images, they often fail to faithfully execute the same spatial relations during text-to-image generation, where such relations constitute core semantic information in remote sensing. Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation. Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis. We then impose Spatial-Aware Query Supervision to bias learnable queries toward spatial relations explicitly specified in the instruction. Finally, we develop Image-Caption Spatial Layout Variation to expose the model to systematic geometry-consistent spatial transformations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves spatial faithfulness in text-to-image generation, while maintaining strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks like image captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cordelia Hu, Jennifer Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail. This assumption often fails with complex predictive models, particularly those based on neural networks, a phenomenon referred to as non-determinism.
  In this work, we propose a new compression algorithm based on next-token prediction that is robust to arbitrarily large, but structured, prediction mismatches. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme under a formal mismatch certification, characterize its theoretical performance, and validate it experimentally on real datasets. Our results demonstrate reliable operation within the certified mismatch regime while achieving compression ratios that exceed those of commonly used compression methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, He Cao, Shenyao Peng, Zijing Liu, Bin Feng, Yu Wang, Zhiyuan Yan, Yonghong Tian, Yu Li, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are revolutionizing the biochemistry domain, assisting scientists in drug design and chemical synthesis with high efficiency. Yet current approaches struggle between small language models prone to hallucination and limited knowledge retention, and large cloud-based language models plagued by privacy risks and high inference costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChemCRAFT, a novel framework leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to decouple chemical reasoning from knowledge storage. Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox. Based on sandbox interactions, we constructed ChemToolDataset, the first large-scale chemical tool trajectory dataset. Simultaneously, we propose SMILES-GRPO to build a dense chemical reward function, promoting the model's ability to call chemical agents. Evaluations across diverse aspects of drug design show that ChemCRAFT outperforms current cloud-based LLMs in molecular structure analysis, molecular optimization, and synthesis pathway prediction, demonstrating that scientific reasoning is not solely an emergent ability of model scale, but a learnable policy of tool orchestration. This work establishes a cost-effective and privacy-preserving paradigm for AI-aided chemistry, opening new avenues for accelerating molecular discovery with locally deployable agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziling Gong, Yunyan Ouyang, Iram Kamdar, Melody Ma, Hongjie Chen, Franck Dernoncourt, Ryan A. Rossi, Nesreen K. Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio fingerprinting provides an identifiable representation of acoustic signals, which can be later used for identification and retrieval systems. To obtain a discriminative representation, the input audio is usually segmented into shorter time intervals, allowing local acoustic features to be extracted and analyzed. Modern neural approaches typically operate on short, fixed-duration audio segments, yet the choice of segment duration is often made heuristically and rarely examined in depth. In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations. Our results show that short segment lengths (0.5-second) generally achieve better performance. Moreover, we evaluate LLM capacity in recommending the best segment length, which shows that GPT-5-mini consistently gives the best suggestions across five considerations among three studied LLMs. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting segment duration in large-scale neural audio retrieval systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengqian Jiang, Jie Zhang, Haoyin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed microphone array (DMA) is a promising next-generation platform for speech interaction, where speech enhancement (SE) is still required to improve the speech quality in noisy cases. Existing SE methods usually first gather raw waveforms at a fusion center (FC) from all devices and then design a multi-microphone model, causing high bandwidth and energy costs. In this work, we propose a \emph{Compress-and-Send Network (CaSNet)} for resource-constrained DMAs, where one microphone serves as the FC and reference. Each of other devices encodes the measured raw data into a feature matrix, which is then compressed by singular value decomposition (SVD) to produce a more compact representation. The received features at the FC are aligned via cross window query with respect to the reference, followed by neural decoding to yield spatially coherent enhanced speech. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed CaSNet can save the data amount with a negligible impact on the performance compared to the uncompressed case.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaile Wang, Jiannong Cao, Yu Yang, Xiaoyin Li, Yinfeng Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), AI model training on private data such as human sensing data is highly desired. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed training framework for this purpuse. However, the data heterogeneity issue among IoT devices can significantly degrade the model performance and convergence speed in FL. Existing approaches limit in fixed client selection and aggregation on cloud server, making the privacy-preserving extraction of client-specific information during local training challenging. To this end, we propose Client-Centric Adaptation federated learning (FedCCA), an algorithm that optimally utilizes client-specific knowledge to learn a unique model for each client through selective adaptation, aiming to alleviate the influence of data heterogeneity. Specifically, FedCCA employs dynamic client selection and adaptive aggregation based on the additional client-specific encoder. To enhance multi-source knowledge transfer, we adopt an attention-based global aggregation strategy. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets to assess the efficacy of FedCCA. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Liu, Jaeuk Lee, Tianhe Chen, Zhibang Jiang, Xiaolin Wen, Yong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactivity is crucial for effective data visualizations. However, it is often challenging to implement interactions for existing static visualizations, since the underlying code and data for existing static visualizations are often not available, and it also takes significant time and effort to enable interactions for them even if the original code and data are available. To fill this gap, we propose Athanor, a novel approach to transform existing static visualizations into interactive ones using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and natural language instructions. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) an action-modification interaction design space that maps visualization interactions into user actions and corresponding adjustments, (2) a multi-agent requirement analyzer that translates natural language instructions into an actionable operational space, and (3) a visualization abstraction transformer that converts static visualizations into flexible and interactive representations regardless of their underlying implementation. Athanor allows users to effortlessly author interactions through natural language instructions, eliminating the need for programming. We conducted two case studies and in-depth interviews with target users to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach in allowing users to conveniently enable flexible interactions for static visualizations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Song, Xinyu Gong, Bangya Liu, Zelin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Subject-to-Video Generation (S2V) methods have achieved high-fidelity and subject-consistent video generation, yet remain constrained to single-view subject references. This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjie Cheng, Ruifeng Yuan, Yongqi Li, Runyang You, Wenjie Wang, Liqiang Nie, Lei Zhang, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Asgor Hossain Reaj, Rajan Das Gupta, Jui Saha Pritha, Abdullah Al Noman, Abir Ahmed, Golam Md Mohiuddin, Tze Hui Liew</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years; yet, issues of intrinsic gender bias persist, especially in non-English languages. Although current research mostly emphasizes English, the linguistic and cultural biases inherent in Global South languages, like Bengali, are little examined. This research seeks to examine the characteristics and magnitude of gender bias in Bengali, evaluating the efficacy of current approaches in identifying and alleviating bias. We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and low-income areas, gathering authentic insights on gender bias. The findings demonstrate that gender bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages. This study establishes a foundation for further investigations into bias reduction in Bengali and other Indic languages, promoting the development of more inclusive and fair NLP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Gond, Aditya K Kamath, Arkaprava Basu, Ramachandran Ramjee, Ashish Panwar</p>
<p>Abstract: In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.
  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of large-scale language models has established tokens as compact and meaningful units for natural-language representation, which motivates token communication over wireless channels, where tokens are considered fundamental units for wireless transmission. We propose a context-aware token communication framework that uses a pretrained masked language model (MLM) as a shared contextual probability model between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). At Rx, we develop an iterative token detection method that jointly exploits MLM-guided contextual priors and channel observations based on a Bayesian perspective. At Tx, we additionally introduce a context-aware masking strategy which skips highly predictable token transmission to reduce transmission rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves reconstructed sentence quality and supports effective rate adaptation under various channel conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Liu, Xiaoyu Guan, Di Liang, Xianjie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a crucial step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, conflicting objectives across heterogeneous SFT tasks often induce the "seesaw effect": optimizing for one task may degrade performance on others, particularly when model parameters are updated indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages. During multi-stage SFT, core parameters acquired in prior tasks are frozen, thereby preventing overwriting by subsequent tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted intensive experiments on multiple public datasets. The results showed that our dynamic parameter isolation strategy consistently reduced data conflicts and achieved consistent performance improvements compared to multi-stage and multi-task tuning baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep-learning models in data-driven applications has drawn attention to the potential risks associated with biased datasets and models. Neglected or hidden biases within datasets and models can lead to unexpected results. This study addresses the challenges of dataset bias and explores ``shortcut learning'' or ``Clever Hans effect'' in binary classifiers. We propose a novel framework for analyzing the black-box classifiers and for examining the impact of both training and test data on classifier scores. Our framework incorporates intervention and observational perspectives, employing a linear mixed-effects model for post-hoc analysis. By evaluating classifier performance beyond error rates, we aim to provide insights into biased datasets and offer a comprehensive understanding of their influence on classifier behavior. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on audio anti-spoofing and speaker verification tasks using both statistical models and deep neural networks. The insights gained from this study have broader implications for tackling biases in other domains and advancing the field of explainable artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: The construction of function calling agents has emerged as a promising avenue for extending model capabilities. A major challenge for this task is obtaining high quality diverse data for training. Prior work emphasizes diversity in functions, invocation patterns, and interaction turns, yet linguistic diversity of requests and coverage of arguments (e.g., \texttt{city\_name}, \texttt{stock\_ticker}) remain underexplored. We propose a method that generates synthetic datasets via optimizing general-purpose diversity metrics across both queries and arguments, without relying on hand-crafted rules or taxonomies, making it robust to different usecases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique via both intrinsic and extrinsic testing, comparing it to SoTA data generation methods. We show a superiority over baselines in terms of diversity, while keeping comparable correctness. Additionally, when used as a training set, the model resulting from our dataset exhibits superior performance compared to analogous models based on the baseline data generation methods in out-of-distribution performance. In particular, we achieve an $7.4\%$ increase in accuracy on the BFCL benchmark compared to similar counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyang Li, Zhuoya Wang, Xiyan Gui, Xiaoqing Chen, Ziwei Wang, Yaozhi Wen, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding is a critical component of medical diagnostics, rehabilitation engineering, and brain-computer interfaces. However, contemporary decoding methodologies remain heavily dependent on task-specific datasets to train specialized neural network architectures. Consequently, limited data availability impedes the development of generalizable large brain decoding models. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift from conventional signal-based decoding by leveraging large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to analyze EEG waveform plots. By converting multivariate EEG signals into stacked waveform images and integrating neuroscience domain expertise into textual prompts, we demonstrate that foundational VLMs can effectively differentiate between different patterns in the human brain. To address the inherent non-stationarity of EEG signals, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) approach, which dynamically selects the most representative and relevant few-shot examples to condition the autoregressive outputs of the VLM. Experiments on EEG-based seizure detection indicate that state-of-the-art VLMs under RAICL achieved better or comparable performance with traditional time series based approaches. These findings suggest a new direction in physiological signal processing that effectively bridges the modalities of vision, language, and neural activities. Furthermore, the utilization of off-the-shelf VLMs, without the need for retraining or downstream architecture construction, offers a readily deployable solution for clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapeng Wang, Changxin Tian, Kunlong Chen, Ziqi Liu, Jiaxin Mao, Wayne Xin Zhao, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures is essential for unlocking the full potential of large language models (LLMs), yet identifying the optimal composition remains computationally prohibitive due to reliance on heuristic trials or expensive proxy training. To address this, we introduce \textbf{MergeMix}, a novel approach that efficiently determines optimal data mixing ratios by repurposing model merging weights as a high-fidelity, low-cost performance proxy. By training domain-specific experts on minimal tokens and optimizing their merging weights against downstream benchmarks, MergeMix effectively optimizes the performance of data mixtures without incurring the cost of full-scale training. Extensive experiments on models with 8B and 16B parameters validate that MergeMix achieves performance comparable to or surpassing exhaustive manual tuning while drastically reducing search costs. Furthermore, MergeMix exhibits high rank consistency (Spearman $\rho > 0.9$) and strong cross-scale transferability, offering a scalable, automated solution for data mixture optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao He, Tieyuan Chen, Kangyu Wang, Ziran Qin, Yang Shao, Chaofan Gan, Shijie Li, Zuxuan Wu, Weiyao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard Autoregressive Video LLMs inevitably suffer from causal masking biases that hinder global spatiotemporal modeling, leading to suboptimal understanding efficiency. We propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Model utilizing bidirectional attention to capture bidirectional dependencies. To further tackle the inference bottleneck of diffusion decoding on massive video tokens, we introduce MARS-Cache. This framework accelerates inference by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention, effectively pruning redundancy while preserving global connectivity via anchor tokens. Extensive experiments show VidLaDA outperforms diffusion baselines and rivals state-of-the-art autoregressive models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video), with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising reasoning accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahibpreet Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The study investigates the juridico-technological architecture of international public health instruments, focusing on their implementation across India, the European Union, the United States and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses a research lacuna: the insufficient harmonisation between normative health law and algorithmic public health infrastructures in resource-constrained jurisdictions. The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding. The findings highlight the relevance of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and GDPR as regulatory prototypes for health-oriented algorithmic governance and contrast them with embryonic AI integration and limited internet penetration in many LMICs. The study argues for embedding AI within a rights-compliant, supranationally coordinated regulatory framework to secure equitable health outcomes and stronger compliance. It proposes a model for algorithmic treaty-making inspired by FCTC architecture and calls for WHO-led compliance mechanisms modelled on the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to enhance pandemic preparedness, surveillance equity and transnational governance resilience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilong Xu, Zhi Zheng, Xiang Long, Yujun Cai, Yiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form deep research requires multi-faceted investigations over extended horizons to get a comprehensive report. When handling such complex tasks, existing agents manage context at the subtask level to overcome linear context accumulation and information loss. However, they still adhere to a single context window and sequential execution paradigm, which results in mutual interference and blocking behavior, restricting scalability and adaptability. To address this issue, this paper introduces Self-Manager, a parallel agent loop that enables asynchronous and concurrent execution. The main thread can create multiple subthreads, each with its own isolated context, and manage them iteratively through Thread Control Blocks, allowing for more focused and flexible parallel agent execution. To assess its effectiveness, we benchmark Self-Manager on DeepResearch Bench, where it consistently outperforms existing single-agent loop baselines across all metrics. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the necessity of Self-Manager's design choices, as well as its advantages in contextual capacity, efficiency, and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyu Fan, Zhaoxiang Li, Yi Lu, Wang Chen, Qiu Shen, Xiao-xiao Long, Yinghao Cai, Tao Lu, Shuo Wang, Xun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation in cluttered scenes requires policies that remain stable under occlusions, viewpoint and scene variations. Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.
  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.
  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahibpreet Singh, Manjit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence's rapid integration with intellectual property rights necessitates assessment of its impact on trade secrets, copyrights and patents. This study addresses lacunae in existing laws where India lacks AI-specific provisions, creating doctrinal inconsistencies and enforcement inefficacies. Global discourse on AI-IPR protections remains nascent. The research identifies gaps in Indian IP laws' adaptability to AI-generated outputs: trade secret protection is inadequate against AI threats; standardized inventorship criteria are absent. Employing doctrinal and comparative methodology, it scrutinizes legislative texts, judicial precedents and policy instruments across India, US, UK and EU. Preliminary findings reveal shortcomings: India's contract law creates fragmented trade secret regime; Section 3(k) of Indian Patents Act blocks AI invention patenting; copyright varies in authorship attribution. The study proposes harmonized legal taxonomy accommodating AI's role while preserving innovation incentives. India's National AI Strategy (2024) shows progress but legislative clarity is imperative. This contributes to global discourse with AI-specific IP protections ensuring resilience and equitable innovation. Promising results underscore recalibrating India's IP jurisprudence for global alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Foster, Kirill Paramonov, Mete Ozay, Umberto Michieli</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is a paradigm where a model, initially trained on a dataset of base classes, must adapt to an expanding problem space by recognizing novel classes with limited data. We focus on the challenging FSCIL setup where a model receives only a single sample (1-shot) for each novel class and no further training or model alterations are allowed after the base training phase. This makes generalization to novel classes particularly difficult. We propose a novel approach predicated on the hypothesis that base and novel class embeddings have structural similarity. We map the original embedding space into a residual space by subtracting the class prototype (i.e., the average class embedding) of input samples. Then, we leverage generative modeling with VAE or diffusion models to learn the multi-modal distribution of residuals over the base classes, and we use this as a valuable structural prior to improve recognition of novel classes. Our approach, Gen1S, consistently improves novel class recognition over the state of the art across multiple benchmarks and backbone architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyi Liu, Mohammad Khalil, Naman Goel</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, such as the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), are pre-trained on a massive number of synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCM). They leverage in-context learning to offer high predictive accuracy in real-world tasks. However, the fairness properties of these foundational models, which incorporate ideas from causal reasoning during pre-training, have not yet been explored in sufficient depth. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts. Our results reveal that while TabPFN achieves stronger predictive accuracy compared to baselines and exhibits robustness to spurious correlations, improvements in fairness are moderate and inconsistent, particularly under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) covariate shifts. These findings suggest that the causal pre-training in TabPFN is helpful but insufficient for algorithmic fairness, highlighting implications for deploying such models in practice and the need for further fairness interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyu Xiao, Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Yong Luo, Jia Liu, Jie Xu, Han Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vi Vu, Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Tien-Thinh Nguyen, Ba-Thinh Lam, Hoang-Thien Nguyen, Tianyang Wang, Xingjian Li, Min Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong generalization, yet adapting them to medical images remains difficult due to domain shift, scarce labels, and the inability of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to exploit unlabeled data. While conventional models like U-Net excel in semi-supervised medical learning, their potential to assist a PEFT SAM has been largely overlooked. We introduce SC-SAM, a specialist-generalist framework where U-Net provides point-based prompts and pseudo-labels to guide SAM's adaptation, while SAM serves as a powerful generalist supervisor to regularize U-Net. This reciprocal guidance forms a bidirectional co-training loop that allows both models to effectively exploit the unlabeled data. Across prostate MRI and polyp segmentation benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming other existing semi-supervised SAM variants and even medical foundation models like MedSAM, highlighting the value of specialist-generalist cooperation for label-efficient medical image segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Majid Zahedi, Rupert Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a setting in which a group of agents share resources that must be allocated among them in each discrete time period. Agents have time-varying demands and derive constant marginal utility from each unit of resource received up to their demand, with zero utility for any additional resources. In this setting, it is known that independently maximizing the minimum utility in each round satisfies sharing incentives (agents weakly prefer participating in the mechanism to not participating), strategyproofness (agents have no incentive to misreport their demands), and Pareto efficiency (Freeman et al. 2018). However, recent work (Vuppalapati et al. 2023) has shown that this max-min mechanism can lead to large disparities in the total resources received by agents, even when they have the same average demand. In this paper, we introduce credit fairness, a strengthening of sharing incentives that ensures agents who lend resources in early rounds are able to recoup them in later rounds. Credit fairness can be achieved in conjunction with either Pareto efficiency or strategyproofness, but not both. We propose a mechanism that is credit fair and Pareto efficient, and we evaluate its performance in a computational resource-sharing setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpretability remains a key challenge for deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings such as Alzheimer's disease progression diagnosis, where early and trustworthy predictions are essential. Existing attribution methods exhibit high inter-method variability and unstable explanations due to the polysemantic nature of LLM representations, while mechanistic interpretability approaches lack direct alignment with model inputs and outputs and do not provide explicit importance scores. We introduce a unified interpretability framework that integrates attributional and mechanistic perspectives through monosemantic feature extraction. By constructing a monosemantic embedding space at the level of an LLM layer and optimizing the framework to explicitly reduce inter-method variability, our approach produces stable input-level importance scores and highlights salient features via a decompressed representation of the layer of interest, advancing the safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in cognitive health and neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kshitij Mishra, Nils Lukas, Salem Lahlou</p>
<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle with complex reasoning because exploration is expensive under tight compute budgets. We introduce Semantic Diversity-Exploration-Exploitation (SD-E$^2$), a reinforcement learning framework that makes exploration explicit by optimizing semantic diversity in generated reasoning trajectories. Using a frozen sentence-embedding model, SD-E$^2$ assigns a diversity reward that captures (i) the coverage of semantically distinct solution strategies and (ii) their average pairwise dissimilarity in embedding space, rather than surface-form novelty. This diversity reward is combined with outcome correctness and solution efficiency in a z-score-normalized multi-objective objective that stabilizes training. On GSM8K, SD-E$^2$ surpasses the base Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and strong GRPO baselines (GRPO-CFL and GRPO-CFEE) by +27.4, +5.2, and +1.5 percentage points, respectively, while discovering on average 9.8 semantically distinct strategies per question. We further improve MedMCQA to 49.64% versus 38.37% for the base model and show gains on the harder AIME benchmark (1983-2025), reaching 13.28% versus 6.74% for the base. These results indicate that rewarding semantic novelty yields a more compute-efficient exploration-exploitation signal for training reasoning-capable SLMs. By introducing cognitive adaptation-adjusting the reasoning process structure rather than per-token computation-SD-E$^2$ offers a complementary path to efficiency gains in resource-constrained models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as an effective paradigm to enhance link quality between clients and the server. However, ensuring model accuracy while preserving privacy under unreliable communication remains a key challenge in HFL, as the coordination among privacy noise can be randomly disrupted. To address this limitation, we propose a robust hierarchical secure aggregation scheme, termed H-SecCoGC, which integrates coding strategies to enforce structured aggregation. The proposed scheme not only ensures accurate global model construction under varying levels of privacy, but also avoids the partial participation issue, thereby significantly improving robustness, privacy preservation, and learning efficiency. Both theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme under unreliable communication across arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable transformation of unstructured person and address text into structured data remains a key challenge in large-scale information systems. Traditional rule-based and probabilistic approaches perform well on clean inputs but fail under noisy or multilingual conditions, while neural and large language models (LLMs) often lack deterministic control and reproducibility. This paper introduces a prompt-driven, validation-centered framework that converts free-text records into a consistent 17-field schema without fine-tuning. The method integrates input normalisation, structured prompting, constrained decoding, and strict rule-based validation under fixed experimental settings to ensure reproducibility. Evaluations on heterogeneous real-world address data show high field-level accuracy, strong schema adherence, and stable confidence calibration. The results demonstrate that combining deterministic validation with generative prompting provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for structured information extraction, offering a practical alternative to training-heavy or domain-specific models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahana Ghosh, Advait Sarkar, Si\^an Lindley, Christian Poelitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools improve productivity in knowledge workflows such as writing, but also risk overreliance and reduced critical thinking. Cognitive forcing functions (CFFs) mitigate these risks by requiring active engagement with AI output. As GenAI workflows grow more complex, systems increasingly present execution plans for user review. However, these plans are themselves AI-generated and prone to overreliance, and the effectiveness of applying CFFs to AI plans remains underexplored. We conduct a controlled experiment in which participants completed AI-assisted writing tasks while reviewing AI-generated plans under four CFF conditions: Assumption (argument analysis), WhatIf (hypothesis testing), Both, and a no-CFF control. A follow-up think-aloud and interview study qualitatively compared these conditions. Results show that the Assumption CFF most effectively reduced overreliance without increasing cognitive load, while participants perceived the WhatIf CFF as most helpful. These findings highlight the value of plan-focused CFFs for supporting critical reflection in GenAI-assisted knowledge work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Shao, Yong Xu, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial information is a critical clue for multi-channel multi-speaker target speech recognition. Most state-of-the-art multi-channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems extract spatial features only during the speech separation stage, followed by standard single-channel ASR on the separated speech. This approach results in an inefficient, lengthy pipeline and sub-optimal ASR performance due to the accumulated errors from preprocessing modules. Furthermore, most spatial feature extraction methods depend on the knowledge of speaker positions and microphone topology, making the systems reliant on specific settings and challenging to adapt to new equipment. In this work, we propose a solution to these issues with a lightweight embedding module named SpatialEmb, which extracts and encodes spatial information directly for the ASR model, supporting both fixed and arbitrary microphone topology. We conduct comprehensive experiments on AliMeeting, a real meeting corpus, to determine the optimal model design for SpatialEmb in terms of both performance and efficiency. Our best model trained with 105 hours Train-Ali-far achieves 17.04% and 20.32% character error rates (CER) on the Eval and Test sets, establishing a new state-of-the-art result with the same training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in medical images is essential for analyzing morphological patterns in clinical applications. Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation. Our design is flexible and can be seamlessly combined with other topology-based methods to further enhance segmentation performance. Experimental results show that integrating topological features enhances model robustness, effectively handling challenges like overexposure and blurring in medical imaging. Our approach on three curvilinear benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and topological fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pulin Agrawal, Prasoon Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to produce outputs with limited diversity. In this work, we study whether infusing random concepts in the prompts can improve the diversity of the generated outputs. To benchmark the approach, we design a systematic evaluation protocol which involves prompting an LLM with questions of the form "Name 10 Hollywood actors", and analyzing diversity measures of the resulting LLM outputs. Our experiments on multiple LLMs show that prepending random words/sentences unrelated to the prompt result in greater diversity in the outputs of LLMs. We believe that this promising result and the evaluation protocol opens up interesting avenues for future work, such as how infusing randomness into LLMs could be applied to other domains. Further, the evaluation protocol could also inspire research into benchmarking LLM diversity more systematically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasi Hays</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Resonant Sparse Geometry Networks (RSGN), a brain-inspired architecture with self-organizing sparse
  hierarchical input-dependent connectivity. Unlike Transformer architectures that employ dense attention mechanisms with
  O(n^2) computational complexity, RSGN embeds computational nodes in learned hyperbolic space where connection strength
  decays with geodesic distance, achieving dynamic sparsity that adapts to each input. The architecture operates on two
  distinct timescales: fast differentiable activation propagation optimized through gradient descent, and slow
  Hebbian-inspired structural learning for connectivity adaptation through local correlation rules. We provide rigorous
  mathematical analysis demonstrating that RSGN achieves O(n*k) computational complexity, where k << n represents the average
  active neighborhood size. Experimental evaluation on hierarchical classification and long-range dependency tasks
  demonstrates that RSGN achieves 96.5% accuracy on long-range dependency tasks while using approximately 15x fewer
  parameters than standard Transformers. On challenging hierarchical classification with 20 classes, RSGN achieves 23.8%
  accuracy (compared to 5% random baseline) with only 41,672 parameters, nearly 10x fewer than the Transformer baselines
  which require 403,348 parameters to achieve 30.1% accuracy. Our ablation studies confirm the contribution of each architectural
  component, with Hebbian learning providing consistent improvements. These results suggest that brain-inspired principles
  of sparse, geometrically-organized computation offer a promising direction toward more efficient and biologically plausible
  neural architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Pan, Sizhao Chen, Zhaorui Wang, Tse-Tin Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring timely and semantically accurate information delivery is critical in real-time wireless systems. While Age of Information (AoI) quantifies temporal freshness, Version Age of Information (VAoI) captures semantic staleness by accounting for version evolution between transmitters and receivers. Existing VAoI scheduling approaches primarily focus on minimizing average VAoI, overlooking rare but severe staleness events that can compromise reliability under stochastic packet arrivals and unreliable channels. This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm. By generating actions through a diffusion-based denoising process, D2SAC enhances policy expressiveness and establishes a strong baseline for mean performance. Building on this foundation, we put forth RS-D3SAC, a risk-sensitive deep distributional diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. RS-D3SAC integrates a diffusion-based actor with a quantile-based distributional critic, explicitly modeling the full VAoI return distribution. This enables principled tail-risk optimization via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) while satisfying long-term transmission cost constraints. Extensive simulations show that, while D2SAC reduces average VAoI, RS-D3SAC consistently achieves substantial reductions in CVaR without sacrificing mean performance. The dominant gain in tail-risk reduction stems from the distributional critic, with the diffusion-based actor providing complementary refinement to stabilize and enrich policy decisions, highlighting their effectiveness for robust and risk-aware VAoI scheduling in multi-user wireless systems.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18085">&quot;Crash Test Dummies&quot; for AI-Enabled Clinical Assessment: Validating Virtual Patient Scenarios with Virtual Learners</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Gin, Ahreum Lim, Fl\'avia Silva e Oliveira, Kuan Xing, Xiaomei Song, Gayana Amiyangoda, Thilanka Seneviratne, Alison F. Doubleday, Ananya Gangopadhyaya, Bob Kiser, Lukas Shum-Tim, Dhruva Patel, Kosala Marambe, Lauren Maggio, Ara Tekian, Yoon Soo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: In medical and health professions education (HPE), AI is increasingly used to assess clinical competencies, including via virtual standardized patients. However, most evaluations rely on AI-human interrater reliability and lack a measurement framework for how cases, learners, and raters jointly shape scores. This leaves robustness uncertain and can expose learners to misguidance from unvalidated systems. We address this by using AI "simulated learners" to stress-test and psychometrically characterize assessment pipelines before human use.
  Objective: Develop an open-source AI virtual patient platform and measurement model for robust competency evaluation across cases and rating conditions.
  Methods: We built a platform with virtual patients, virtual learners with tunable ACGME-aligned competency profiles, and multiple independent AI raters scoring encounters with structured Key-Features items. Transcripts were analyzed with a Bayesian HRM-SDT model that treats ratings as decisions under uncertainty and separates learner ability, case performance, and rater behavior; parameters were estimated with MCMC.
  Results: The model recovered simulated learners' competencies, with significant correlations to the generating competencies across all ACGME domains despite a non-deterministic pipeline. It estimated case difficulty by competency and showed stable rater detection (sensitivity) and criteria (severity/leniency thresholds) across AI raters using identical models/prompts but different seeds. We also propose a staged "safety blueprint" for deploying AI tools with learners, tied to entrustment-based validation milestones.
  Conclusions: Combining a purpose-built virtual patient platform with a principled psychometric model enables robust, interpretable, generalizable competency estimates and supports validation of AI-assisted assessment prior to use with human learners.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoEs) have become a central component of many state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary large language models. Despite their widespread adoption, it remains unclear how close existing MoE architectures are to optimal with respect to inference cost, as measured by accuracy per floating-point operation and per parameter. In this work, we revisit MoE design from a hardware-software co-design perspective, grounded in empirical and theoretical considerations. We characterize key performance bottlenecks across diverse deployment regimes, spanning offline high-throughput execution and online, latency-critical inference. Guided by these insights, we introduce LatentMoE, a new model architecture resulting from systematic design exploration and optimized for maximal accuracy per unit of compute. Empirical design space exploration at scales of up to 95B parameters and over a 1T-token training horizon, together with supporting theoretical analysis, shows that LatentMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE architectures in terms of accuracy per FLOP and per parameter. Given its strong performance, the LatentMoE architecture has been adopted by the flagship Nemotron-3 Super and Ultra models and scaled to substantially larger regimes, including longer token horizons and larger model sizes, as reported in Nvidia et al. (arXiv:2512.20856).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Fasha, Faisal Abul Rub, Nasim Matar, Bilal Sowan, Mohammad Al Khaldy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative and disruptive technology, enabling a wide range of applications in natural language processing, machine translation, and beyond. However, this widespread integration of LLMs also raised several security concerns highlighted by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which has identified the top 10 security vulnerabilities inherent in LLM applications. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial, given the increasing reliance on LLMs and the potential threats to data integrity, confidentiality, and service availability. This paper presents a framework designed to mitigate the security risks outlined in the OWASP Top 10. Our proposed model leverages LLM-enabled intelligent agents, offering a new approach to proactively identify, assess, and counteract security threats in real-time. The proposed framework serves as an initial blueprint for future research and development, aiming to enhance the security measures of LLMs and protect against emerging threats in this rapidly evolving landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent revolution in data-driven methods for weather forecasting has lead to a fragmented landscape of complex, bespoke architectures and training strategies, obscuring the fundamental drivers of forecast accuracy. Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art probabilistic skill requires neither intricate architectural constraints nor specialized training heuristics. We introduce a scalable framework for learning multi-scale atmospheric dynamics by combining a directly downsampled latent space with a history-conditioned local projector that resolves high-resolution physics. We find that our framework design is robust to the choice of probabilistic estimator, seamlessly supporting stochastic interpolants, diffusion models, and CRPS-based ensemble training. Validated against the Integrated Forecasting System and the deep learning probabilistic model GenCast, our framework achieves statistically significant improvements on most of the variables. These results suggest scaling a general-purpose model is sufficient for state-of-the-art medium-range prediction, eliminating the need for tailored training recipes and proving effective across the full spectrum of probabilistic frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based web agents have become increasingly popular for their utility in daily life and work. However, they exhibit critical vulnerabilities when processing malicious URLs: accepting a disguised malicious URL enables subsequent access to unsafe webpages, which can cause severe damage to service providers and users. Despite this risk, no benchmark currently targets this emerging threat. To address this gap, we propose MalURLBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' vulnerabilities to malicious URLs. MalURLBench contains 61,845 attack instances spanning 10 real-world scenarios and 7 categories of real malicious websites. Experiments with 12 popular LLMs reveal that existing models struggle to detect elaborately disguised malicious URLs. We further identify and analyze key factors that impact attack success rates and propose URLGuard, a lightweight defense module. We believe this work will provide a foundational resource for advancing the security of web agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiangYingEr/MalURLBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to silence in early stages, lung cancer has been one of the most leading causes of mortality in cancer patients world-wide. Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Hadi Nezhad, Francisco Enrique Vicente Castro, Ivon Arroyo</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) (e.g., chatbots) are increasingly used in settings where users disclose sensitive information, raising significant privacy concerns. Because privacy judgments are highly contextual, supporting users to engage in privacy-protective actions during chatbot interactions is essential. However, enabling meaningful engagement requires a deeper understanding of how users currently reason about and manage sensitive information during realistic chatbot use scenarios. To investigate this, we qualitatively examined computer science (undergraduate and masters) students' in-the-moment disclosure and protection behaviors, as well as the reasoning underlying these behaviors, across a range of realistic chatbot tasks. Participants used a simulated ChatGPT interface with and without a privacy notice panel that intercepts message submissions, highlights potentially sensitive information, and offers privacy protective actions. The panel supports anonymization through retracting, faking, and generalizing, and surfaces two of ChatGPT's built-in privacy controls to improve their discoverability. Drawing on interaction logs, think-alouds, and survey responses, we analyzed how the panel fostered privacy awareness, encouraged protective actions, and supported context-specific reasoning about what information to protect and how. We further discuss design opportunities for tools that provide users greater and more meaningful agency in protecting sensitive information during CA interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data transparency has emerged as a rallying cry for addressing concerns about AI: data quality, privacy, and copyright chief among them. Yet while these calls are crucial for accountability, current transparency policies often fall short of their intended aims. Similar to nutrition facts for food, policies aimed at nutrition facts for AI currently suffer from a limited consideration of research on effective disclosures. We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact. Third, policy proposals manifest an impact gap between disclosed information and meaningful changes in developer practices and public understanding. Informed by the social science on transparency, our analysis identifies affirmative paths for transparency that are effective rather than merely symbolic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunat Pipatanakul, Pittawat Taveekitworachai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have progressed rapidly; however, most state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated primarily in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, and are often developed by a small number of organizations with access to large-scale compute and data. This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicong Li, Shan Jin, Qi Liu, Shuo Wang, Jiaying Liu, Shuo Yu, Qiang Zhang, Kuanjiu Zhou, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: In social recommenders, the inherent nonlinearity and opacity of synergistic effects across multiple social networks hinders users from understanding how diverse information is leveraged for recommendations, consequently diminishing explainability. However, existing explainers can only identify the topological information in social networks that significantly influences recommendations, failing to further explain the synergistic effects among this information. Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them. SemExplainer first extracts explanatory subgraphs from multi-view social networks to generate preliminary importance explanations for recommendations. A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs. Finally, SemExplainer searches for paths from users to recommended items within the synergistic subgraphs to generate explanations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExplainer over baseline methods, providing superior explanations of synergistic effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Mukherjee, Hannah Hanwen Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Key doctrines, including novelty (patent), originality (copyright), and distinctiveness (trademark), turn on a shared empirical question: whether a body of work is meaningfully distinct from a relevant reference class. Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice-ASR, a general-purpose speech understanding framework built upon VibeVoice, designed to address the persistent challenges of context fragmentation and multi-speaker complexity in long-form audio (e.g., meetings, podcasts) that remain despite recent advancements in short-form speech recognition. Unlike traditional pipelined approaches that rely on audio chunking, VibeVoice-ASRsupports single-pass processing for up to 60 minutes of audio. It unifies Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, and Timestamping into a single end-to-end generation task. In addition, VibeVoice-ASR supports over 50 languages, requires no explicit language setting, and natively handles code-switching within and across utterances.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiye Zhu, Zekai Zhang, Xiangchen Wang, Hewei Pan, Teng Wang, Tiantian Geng, Rongtao Xu, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to interpret natural language instructions and act coherently in visually rich environments. However, most existing methods rely on reactive state-action mappings without explicitly modeling how actions causally transform subsequent visual observations. Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \textsc{NaVIDA} (\textbf{Nav}igation with \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{D}ynamics \textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution. \textsc{NaVIDA} augments training with chunk-based inverse-dynamics supervision to learn causal relationship between visual changes and corresponding actions. To structure this supervision and extend the effective planning range, \textsc{NaVIDA} employs hierarchical probabilistic action chunking (HPAC), which organizes trajectories into multi-step chunks and provides discriminative, longer-range visual-change cues. To further curb error accumulation and stabilize behavior at inference, an entropy-guided mechanism adaptively sets the execution horizon of action chunks. Extensive experiments show that \textsc{NaVIDA} achieves superior navigation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters (3B vs. 8B). Real-world robot evaluations further validate the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Code and data will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhang, Xinchen Lyu, Chenshan Ren, Shuhan Liu, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Wireless foundation models promise transformative capabilities for channel state information (CSI) processing across diverse 6G network applications, yet face fundamental challenges due to the inherent dual heterogeneity of CSI across both scale and scenario dimensions. However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Burgess, Jan N. Hansen, Duo Peng, Yuhui Zhang, Alejandro Lozano, Min Woo Sun, Emma Lundberg, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Search agents are language models (LMs) that reason and search knowledge bases (or the web) to answer questions; recent methods supervise only the final answer accuracy using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Most RLVR search agents tackle general-domain QA, which limits their relevance to technical AI systems in science, engineering, and medicine. In this work we propose training agents to search and reason over scientific papers -- this tests technical question-answering, it is directly relevant to real scientists, and the capabilities will be crucial to future AI Scientist systems. Concretely, we release a search corpus of 16 million biomedical paper abstracts and construct a challenging factoid QA dataset called PaperSearchQA with 60k samples answerable from the corpus, along with benchmarks. We train search agents in this environment to outperform non-RL retrieval baselines; we also perform further quantitative analysis and observe interesting agent behaviors like planning, reasoning, and self-verification. Our corpus, datasets, and benchmarks are usable with the popular Search-R1 codebase for RLVR training and released on https://huggingface.co/collections/jmhb/papersearchqa. Finally, our data creation methods are scalable and easily extendable to other scientific domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meziah Ruby Cristobal, Hyeonjeong Byeon, Tze-Yu Chen, Ruoxi Shang, Donghoon Shin, Ruican Zhong, Tony Zhou, Gary Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: The dissemination of scholarly research is critical, yet researchers often lack the time and skills to create engaging content for popular media such as short-form videos. To address this gap, we explore the use of generative AI to help researchers transform their academic papers into accessible video content. Informed by a formative study with science communicators and content creators (N=8), we designed PaperTok, an end-to-end system that automates the initial creative labor by generating script options and corresponding audiovisual content from a source paper. Researchers can then refine based on their preferences with further prompting. A mixed-methods user study (N=18) and crowdsourced evaluation (N=100) demonstrate that PaperTok's workflow can help researchers create engaging and informative short-form videos. We also identified the need for more fine-grained controls in the creation process. To this end, we offer implications for future generative tools that support science outreach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trong Khiem Tran, Manh Cuong Dao, Phi Le Nguyen, Thao Nguyen Truong, Trong Nghia Hoang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting pre-trained models to unseen feature modalities has become increasingly important due to the growing need for cross-disciplinary knowledge integration.~A key challenge here is how to align the representation of new modalities with the most relevant parts of the pre-trained model's representation space to enable accurate knowledge transfer.~This requires combining feature alignment with target fine-tuning, but uncalibrated combinations can exacerbate misalignment between the source and target feature-label structures and reduce target generalization.~Existing work however lacks a theoretical understanding of this critical interaction between feature alignment and target fitting.~To bridge this gap, we develop a principled framework that establishes a provable generalization bound on the target error, which explains the interaction between feature alignment and target fitting through a novel concept of feature-label distortion.~This bound offers actionable insights into how this interaction should be optimized for practical algorithm design. The resulting approach achieves significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulaziz AlDakheel, Ali Alshehre, Esraa Alamoudi, Moslim AlKhabbaz, Ahmed Aljohani, Raed Alharbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly becoming embedded in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation under Vision 2030, yet public awareness, adoption, and concerns surrounding these tools remain underexplored. This study provides an early snapshot of GenAI engagement among Saudi nationals. Using a nationwide survey of 330 participants across regions, age groups, and employment sectors, we examine seven dimensions of GenAI use: awareness and understanding, adoption patterns, perceived impacts, training needs, risks and barriers, data-sharing behaviors, and future expectations. Findings show that 93% of respondents actively use GenAI primarily for text-based tasks, while more advanced uses such as programming or multimodal generation are less common. Despite the prevalence of use, overall awareness and conceptual understanding remain uneven, with many reporting limited technical knowledge. Participants recognize GenAI's benefits for productivity, work quality, and understanding complex information, yet caution that sustained reliance may undermine critical thinking and key professional skills. Trust in AI-generated outputs remains cautious, with widespread concerns about privacy, misinformation, and ethical misuse, including potential job displacement. Respondents show strong interest in structured GenAI training that combines foundational skills, domain-specific applications, and clear guidance on privacy, ethics, and responsible use. These results establish a baseline for GenAI engagement in Saudi Arabia and highlight priorities for policymakers and developers: expanding AI literacy, ensuring culturally and linguistically aligned GenAI solutions, and strengthening frameworks for privacy and responsible deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, their application to unit testing remains largely confined to isolated test generation or oracle prediction, neglecting the broader challenge of test suite maintenance. We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Empirical results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs have limited capabilities in realistic test maintenance processes and yield only marginal improvements in test effectiveness. We release TAM-Eval as an open-source framework to support future research in automated software testing. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/trndcenter/TAM-Eval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Yu, Dingyu Wang, Zimu Yuan, Nan Zhou, Jiajun Liu, Jiaxin Liu, Shanggui Liu, Yaoyan Zheng, Huishu Yuan, Di Huang, Dong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders represent a leading cause of global disability, creating an urgent demand for precise interpretation of medical imaging. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wireframe parsing aims to recover line segments and their junctions to form a structured geometric representation useful for downstream tasks such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Existing methods predict lines and junctions separately and reconcile them post-hoc, causing mismatches and reduced robustness. We present Co-PLNet, a point-line collaborative framework that exchanges spatial cues between the two tasks, where early detections are converted into spatial prompts via a Point-Line Prompt Encoder (PLP-Encoder), which encodes geometric attributes into compact and spatially aligned maps. A Cross-Guidance Line Decoder (CGL-Decoder) then refines predictions with sparse attention conditioned on complementary prompts, enforcing point-line consistency and efficiency. Experiments on Wireframe and YorkUrban show consistent improvements in accuracy and robustness, together with favorable real-time efficiency, demonstrating our effectiveness for structured geometry perception.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate evaluation of user satisfaction is critical for iterative development of conversational AI. However, for open-ended assistants, traditional A/B testing lacks reliable metrics: explicit feedback is sparse, while implicit metrics are ambiguous. To bridge this gap, we introduce BoRP (Bootstrapped Regression Probing), a scalable framework for high-fidelity satisfaction evaluation. Unlike generative approaches, BoRP leverages the geometric properties of LLM latent space. It employs a polarization-index-based bootstrapping mechanism to automate rubric generation and utilizes Partial Least Squares (PLS) to map hidden states to continuous scores. Experiments on industrial datasets show that BoRP (Qwen3-8B/14B) significantly outperforms generative baselines (even Qwen3-Max) in alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, BoRP reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude, enabling full-scale monitoring and highly sensitive A/B testing via CUPED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) faces the critical challenge of balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks). While Experience Replay (ER) is a standard countermeasure against catastrophic forgetting, its impact across diverse capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief "wake-up" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded "safety guarantee" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks. Our findings emphasize the necessity of evaluating structural safety alongside average retention in LLM continual learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZeYu Li, ShiJun Zhang, TieYong Zeng, FengLei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal approximation theory offers a foundational framework to verify neural network expressiveness, enabling principled utilization in real-world applications. However, most existing theoretical constructions are established by uniformly dividing the input space into tiny hypercubes without considering the local regularity of the target function. In this work, we investigate the universal approximation capabilities of ReLU networks from a view of polytope decomposition, which offers a more realistic and task-oriented approach compared to current methods. To achieve this, we develop an explicit kernel polynomial method to derive an universal approximation of continuous functions, which is characterized not only by the refined Totik-Ditzian-type modulus of continuity, but also by polytopical domain decomposition. Then, a ReLU network is constructed to approximate the kernel polynomial in each subdomain separately. Furthermore, we find that polytope decomposition makes our approximation more efficient and flexible than existing methods in many cases, especially near singular points of the objective function. Lastly, we extend our approach to analytic functions to reach a higher approximation rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Indr\.e \v{Z}liobait\.e</p>
<p>Abstract: In many scientific and data-driven applications, machine learning models are increasingly used as measurement instruments, rather than merely as predictors of predefined labels. When the measurement function is learned from data, the mapping from observations to quantities is determined implicitly by the training distribution and inductive biases, allowing multiple inequivalent mappings to satisfy standard predictive evaluation criteria. We formalize learned measurement functions as a distinct focus of evaluation and introduce measurement stability, a property capturing invariance of the measured quantity across admissible realizations of the learning process and across contexts. We show that standard evaluation criteria in machine learning, including generalization error, calibration, and robustness, do not guarantee measurement stability. Through a real-world case study, we show that models with comparable predictive performance can implement systematically inequivalent measurement functions, with distribution shift providing a concrete illustration of this failure. Taken together, our results highlight a limitation of existing evaluation frameworks in settings where learned model outputs are identified as measurements, motivating the need for an additional evaluative dimension.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, safety risks associated with large language models have become increasingly prominent, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate the generation of toxic and harmful content. The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance. Overall, our framework establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for LLM safety alignment, enabling continuous co-evolution within a unified learning loop.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) is inherently challenging, as it requires sophisticated reasoning over dynamic facts with multi-hop dependencies and complex temporal constraints. Existing methods rely on fixed workflows and expensive closed-source APIs, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose Temp-R1, the first autonomous end-to-end agent for TKGQA trained through reinforcement learning. To address cognitive overload in single-action reasoning, we expand the action space with specialized internal actions alongside external action. To prevent shortcut learning on simple questions, we introduce reverse curriculum learning that trains on difficult questions first, forcing the development of sophisticated reasoning before transferring to easier cases. Our 8B-parameter Temp-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA, improving 19.8% over strong baselines on complex questions. Our work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous temporal reasoning agents. Our code will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjukg/Temp-R1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Everlyn Asiko Chimoto, Mostafa Elhoushi, Bruce A. Bassett</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique for reducing the storage footprint and computational costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often results in performance degradation. Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment. We also identify specific failure cases where certain language-quantizer combinations degrade performance, which we trace to differences in activation range distributions across languages. These results highlight that static one-size-fits-all calibration is suboptimal and that tailoring calibration data, both in language and diversity, plays a crucial role in robustly quantizing multilingual LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world visualization tasks involve complex, multi-modal requirements that extend beyond simple text-to-chart generation, requiring reference images, code examples, and iterative refinement. Current systems exhibit fundamental limitations: single-modality input, one-shot generation, and rigid workflows. While LLM-based approaches show potential for these complex requirements, they introduce reliability challenges including catastrophic failures and infinite loop susceptibility. To address this gap, we propose MultiVis-Agent, a logic rule-enhanced multi-agent framework for reliable multi-modal and multi-scenario visualization generation. Our approach introduces a four-layer logic rule framework that provides mathematical guarantees for system reliability while maintaining flexibility. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our logic rules are mathematical constraints that guide LLM reasoning rather than replacing it. We formalize the MultiVis task spanning four scenarios from basic generation to iterative refinement, and develop MultiVis-Bench, a benchmark with over 1,000 cases for multi-modal visualization evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 75.63% visualization score on challenging tasks, significantly outperforming baselines (57.54-62.79%), with task completion rates of 99.58% and code execution success rates of 94.56% (vs. 74.48% and 65.10% without logic rules), successfully addressing both complexity and reliability challenges in automated visualization generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexia Fan, Yu Chen, Qiquan Zhang, Kainan Chen, Xinyuan Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) demonstrates remarkable results in controlled settings but struggles in real-world deployment due to dual imbalance challenges: intra-task imbalance arising from long-tailed direction-of-arrival (DoA) distributions, and inter-task imbalance induced by cross-task skews and overlaps. These often lead to catastrophic forgetting, significantly degrading the localization accuracy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a unified framework with two key innovations. Specifically, we design a GCC-PHAT-based data augmentation (GDA) method that leverages peak characteristics to alleviate intra-task distribution skews. We also propose an Analytic dynamic imbalance rectifier (ADIR) with task-adaption regularization, which enables analytic updates that adapt to inter-task dynamics. On the SSLR benchmark, our proposal achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results of 89.0% accuracy, 5.3{\deg} mean absolute error, and 1.6 backward transfer, demonstrating robustness to evolving imbalances without exemplar storage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong general capability but often struggle with medical terminology precision and safety-critical instruction following. We present a case study for adapter interference in safety-critical domains using a 14B-parameter base model through a two-stage LoRA pipeline: (1) domain-adaptive pre-training (PT) to inject broad medical knowledge via continued pre-training (DAPT), and (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model with medical question-answering behaviors through instruction-style data. To balance instruction-following ability and domain knowledge retention, we propose Weighted Adapter Merging, linearly combining SFT and PT adapters before exporting a merged base-model checkpoint. On a held-out medical validation set (F5/F6), the merged model achieves BLEU-4 = 16.38, ROUGE-1 = 20.42, ROUGE-2 = 4.60, and ROUGE-L = 11.54 under a practical decoding configuration. We further analyze decoding sensitivity and training stability with loss curves and controlled decoding comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manjie Xu, Isabella Yin, Xinyi Tu, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs struggle with Semantic Inertia: the inability to inhibit pre-trained priors (e.g., "Lava is Dangerous") when dynamic, in-context rules contradict them. We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting "Lava is Safe"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael K\"olle, Christian Reff, Leo S\"unkel, Julian Hager, Gerhard Stenzel, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergent cooperation in classical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning has gained significant attention, particularly in the context of Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs). While classical reinforcement learning approaches have demonstrated capability for emergent cooperation, research on extending these methods to Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning remains limited, particularly through communication. In this paper, we apply communication approaches to quantum Q-Learning agents: the Mutual Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MATE) protocol, its extension Mutually Endorsed Distributed Incentive Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MEDIATE), the peer rewarding mechanism Gifting, and Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL). We evaluate these approaches in three SSDs: the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Stag Hunt, and Iterated Game of Chicken. Our experimental results show that approaches using MATE with temporal-difference measure (MATE\textsubscript{TD}), AutoMATE, MEDIATE-I, and MEDIATE-S achieved high cooperation levels across all dilemmas, demonstrating that communication is a viable mechanism for fostering emergent cooperation in Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satya Prakash Dash, Hossein Abdi, Wei Pan, Samuel Kaski, Mingfei Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient regularization (GR) has been shown to improve the generalizability of trained models. While Natural Gradient Descent has been shown to accelerate optimization in the initial phase of training, little attention has been paid to how the training dynamics of second-order optimizers can benefit from GR. In this work, we propose Gradient-Regularized Natural Gradients (GRNG), a family of scalable second-order optimizers that integrate explicit gradient regularization with natural gradient updates. Our framework provides two complementary algorithms: a frequentist variant that avoids explicit inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) via structured approximations, and a Bayesian variant based on a Regularized-Kalman formulation that eliminates the need for FIM inversion entirely. We establish convergence guarantees for GRNG, showing that gradient regularization improves stability and enables convergence to global minima. Empirically, we demonstrate that GRNG consistently enhances both optimization speed and generalization compared to first-order methods (SGD, AdamW) and second-order baselines (K-FAC, Sophia), with strong results on vision and language benchmarks. Our findings highlight gradient regularization as a principled and practical tool to unlock the robustness of natural gradient methods for large-scale deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Hu, Jiacheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep graph learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing graph-structured data and have been widely applied across various fields. However, their complex internal architectures and lack of transparency make it difficult to explain their decisions, resulting in opaque models that users find hard to understand and trust. In this paper, we explore model-level explanation techniques for deep graph learning models, aiming to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the models' overall decision-making processes and underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we address the problem of counterfactual explanations for deep graph learning models by introducing a generative model-level counterfactual explanation approach called GCFX, which is based on deep graph generation. This approach generates a set of high-quality counterfactual explanations that reflect the model's global predictive behavior by leveraging an enhanced deep graph generation framework and a global summarization algorithm. GCFX features an architecture that combines dual encoders, structure-aware taggers, and Message Passing Neural Network decoders, enabling it to accurately learn the true latent distribution of input data and generate high-quality, closely related counterfactual examples. Subsequently, a global counterfactual summarization algorithm selects the most representative and comprehensive explanations from numerous candidate counterfactuals, providing broad insights into the model's global predictive patterns. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFX outperforms existing methods in terms of counterfactual validity and coverage while maintaining low explanation costs, thereby offering crucial support for enhancing the practicality and trustworthiness of global counterfactual explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanmeng Sha, Liyun Zhang, Tomohiro Mashita, Naoya Chiba, Yuki Uranishi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating holistic co-speech gestures that integrate full-body motion with facial expressions suffers from semantically incoherent coordination on body motion and spatially unstable meaningless movements due to existing part-decomposed or frame-level regression methods, We introduce 3DGesPolicy, a novel action-based framework that reformulates holistic gesture generation as a continuous trajectory control problem through diffusion policy from robotics. By modeling frame-to-frame variations as unified holistic actions, our method effectively learns inter-frame holistic gesture motion patterns and ensures both spatially and semantically coherent movement trajectories that adhere to realistic motion manifolds. To further bridge the gap in expressive alignment, we propose a Gesture-Audio-Phoneme (GAP) fusion module that can deeply integrate and refine multi-modal signals, ensuring structured and fine-grained alignment between speech semantics, body motion, and facial expressions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the BEAT2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our 3DGesPolicy across other state-of-the-art methods in generating natural, expressive, and highly speech-aligned holistic gestures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Wei, Suyuan Yao, Cheng Huang, Xiangyu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is a top cause of irreversible blindness globally, making early detection and longitudinal follow-up pivotal to preventing permanent vision loss. Current screening and progression assessment, however, rely on single tests or loosely linked examinations, introducing subjectivity and fragmented care. Limited access to high-quality imaging tools and specialist expertise further compromises consistency and equity in real-world use. To address these gaps, we developed Fair-Eye Net, a fair, reliable multimodal AI system closing the clinical loop from glaucoma screening to follow-up and risk alerting. It integrates fundus photos, OCT structural metrics, VF functional indices, and demographic factors via a dual-stream heterogeneous fusion architecture, with an uncertainty-aware hierarchical gating strategy for selective prediction and safe referral. A fairness constraint reduces missed diagnoses in disadvantaged subgroups. Experimental results show it achieved an AUC of 0.912 (96.7% specificity), cut racial false-negativity disparity by 73.4% (12.31% to 3.28%), maintained stable cross-domain performance, and enabled 3-12 months of early risk alerts (92% sensitivity, 88% specificity). Unlike post hoc fairness adjustments, Fair-Eye Net optimizes fairness as a primary goal with clinical reliability via multitask learning, offering a reproducible path for clinical translation and large-scale deployment to advance global eye health equity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Labroo, Ivaxi Sheth, Vyas Raina, Amaani Ahmed, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong generative capabilities, but many applications require explicit and \textit{fine-grained} control over specific textual concepts, such as humor, persuasiveness, or formality. Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Li, Zijie Lin, Ailin Deng, Xuan Zhang, Yufei He, Shuo Ji, Tri Cao, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at general tasks, they inherently struggle with continual adaptation due to the frozen weights after deployment. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution but incurs prohibitive computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning (JitRL), a training-free framework that enables test-time policy optimization without any gradient updates. JitRL maintains a dynamic, non-parametric memory of experiences and retrieves relevant trajectories to estimate action advantages on-the-fly. These estimates are then used to directly modulate the LLM's output logits. We theoretically prove that this additive update rule is the exact closed-form solution to the KL-constrained policy optimization objective. Extensive experiments on WebArena and Jericho demonstrate that JitRL establishes a new state-of-the-art among training-free methods. Crucially, JitRL outperforms the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods (e.g., WebRL) while reducing monetary costs by over 30 times, offering a scalable path for continual learning agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emna Boudabbous, Mohamed Karaa, Lokman Sboui, Julio Montecinos, Omar Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban bus transit agencies need reliable, network-wide delay predictions to provide accurate arrival information to passengers and support real-time operational control. Accurate predictions help passengers plan their trips, reduce waiting time, and allow operations staff to adjust headways, dispatch extra vehicles, and manage disruptions. Although real-time feeds such as GTFS-Realtime (GTFS-RT) are now widely available, most existing delay prediction systems handle only a few routes, depend on hand-crafted features, and offer little guidance on how to design a scalable, reusable architecture.
  We present a city-scale prediction pipeline that combines multi-resolution feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning. The framework generates 1,683 spatiotemporal features by exploring 23 aggregation combinations over H3 cells, routes, segments, and temporal patterns, and compresses them into 83 components using Adaptive PCA while preserving 95% of the variance. To avoid the "giant cluster" problem that occurs when dense urban areas fall into a single H3 region, we introduce a hybrid H3+topology clustering method that yields 12 balanced route clusters (coefficient of variation 0.608) and enables efficient distributed training.
  We compare five model architectures on six months of bus operations from the Soci\'et\'e de transport de Montr\'eal (STM) network in Montr\'eal. A global LSTM with cluster-aware features achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, outperforming transformer models by 18 to 52% while using 275 times fewer parameters. We also report multi-level evaluation at the elementary segment, segment, and trip level with walk-forward validation and latency analysis, showing that the proposed pipeline is suitable for real-time, city-scale deployment and can be reused for other networks with limited adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linyong Gan, Zimo Li, Wenxin Xu, Xingjian Li, Jianhua Z. Huang, Enmei Tu, Shuhang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate long-horizon vessel trajectory prediction remains challenging due to compounded uncertainty from complex navigation behaviors and environmental factors. Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this letter, we propose an Attention-Based Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (AttenNKF) for state estimation in legged robots. Foot slip is a major source of estimation error: when slip occurs, kinematic measurements violate the no-slip assumption and inject bias during the update step. Our objective is to estimate this slip-induced error and compensate for it. To this end, we augment an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) with a neural compensator that uses an attention mechanism to infer error conditioned on foot-slip severity and then applies this estimate as a post-update compensation to the InEKF state (i.e., after the filter update). The compensator is trained in a latent space, which aims to reduce sensitivity to raw input scales and encourages structured slip-conditioned compensations, while preserving the InEKF recursion. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing legged-robot state estimators, particularly under slip-prone conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonho An, Chaejeong Hyun, Min-Soo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Graph RAG methods aiming for insightful retrieval on corpus graphs typically rely on time-intensive processes that interleave Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Costa, Arthur Vandervoort, Carolin Schmidt, Morten W. Petersen, Martin Drews, Karyn Morrissey, Francisco C. Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change is expected to intensify rainfall and other hazards, increasing disruptions in urban transportation systems. Designing effective adaptation strategies is challenging due to the long-term, sequential nature of infrastructure investments, deep uncertainty, and complex cross-sector interactions. We propose a generic decision-support framework that couples an integrated assessment model (IAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn adaptive, multi-decade investment pathways under uncertainty. The framework combines long-term climate projections (e.g., IPCC scenario pathways) with models that map projected extreme-weather drivers (e.g. rain) into hazard likelihoods (e.g. flooding), propagate hazards into urban infrastructure impacts (e.g. transport disruption), and value direct and indirect consequences for service performance and societal costs. Embedded in a reinforcement-learning loop, it learns adaptive climate adaptation policies that trade off investment and maintenance expenditures against avoided impacts. In collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality, we demonstrate the approach on pluvial flooding in the inner city for the horizon of 2024 to 2100. The learned strategies yield coordinated spatial-temporal pathways and improved robustness relative to conventional optimization baselines, namely inaction and random action, illustrating the framework's transferability to other hazards and cities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural gradients have long been studied in deep reinforcement learning due to their fast convergence properties and covariant weight updates. However, computing natural gradients requires inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive in nature. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable natural policy optimization technique that leverages a rank-1 approximation to full inverse-FIM. We theoretically show that under certain conditions, a rank-1 approximation to inverse-FIM converges faster than policy gradients and, under some conditions, enjoys the same sample complexity as stochastic policy gradient methods. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of environments and show that it achieves superior performance to standard actor-critic and trust-region baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onyedikachi Hope Amaechi-Okorie, Branislav Radeljic</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech remains one of the most visible yet overlooked vectors of inclusion and exclusion in contemporary society. While fluency is often equated with credibility and competence, individuals with atypical speech patterns are routinely marginalized. Given the current state of the debate, this article focuses on the structural biases that shape perceptions of atypical speech and are now being encoded into artificial intelligence. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and voice interfaces, trained predominantly on standardized speech, routinely fail to recognize or respond to diverse voices, compounding digital exclusion. As AI technologies increasingly mediate access to opportunity, the study calls for inclusive technological design, anti-bias training to minimize the impact of discriminatory algorithmic decisions, and enforceable policy reform that explicitly recognize speech diversity as a matter of equity, not merely accessibility. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, the article advocates for a cultural and institutional shift in how we value voice, urging co-created solutions that elevate the rights, representation, and realities of atypical speakers in the digital age. Ultimately, the article reframes speech inclusion as a matter of equity (not accommodation) and advocates for co-created AI systems that reflect the full spectrum of human voices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liheng Yu, Zhe Zhao, Yuxuan Wang, Pengkun Wang, Binwu Wang, Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning, which aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific data from trained models, is crucial for upholding data privacy regulations like the ``right to be forgotten". However, existing research predominantly evaluates unlearning methods on relatively balanced forget sets. This overlooks a common real-world scenario where data to be forgotten, such as a user's activity records, follows a long-tailed distribution. Our work is the first to investigate this critical research gap. We find that in such long-tailed settings, existing methods suffer from two key issues: \textit{Heterogeneous Unlearning Deviation} and \textit{Skewed Unlearning Deviation}. To address these challenges, we propose FaLW, a plug-and-play, instance-wise dynamic loss reweighting method. FaLW innovatively assesses the unlearning state of each sample by comparing its predictive probability to the distribution of unseen data from the same class. Based on this, it uses a forgetting-aware reweighting scheme, modulated by a balancing factor, to adaptively adjust the unlearning intensity for each sample. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaLW achieves superior performance. Code is available at \textbf{Supplementary Material}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Kumar, Mario A. Cypko, Oliver Amft</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate whether temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records can learn clinically meaningful representations without compromising predictive performance, and how architectural choices affect embedding quality. Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider time discretization for score-based diffusion models to generate samples from a learned reverse-time dynamic on a finite grid. Uniform and hand-crafted grids can be suboptimal given a budget on the number of time steps. We introduce Adaptive Reparameterized Time (ART) that controls the clock speed of a reparameterized time variable, leading to a time change and uneven timesteps along the sampling trajectory while preserving the terminal time. The objective is to minimize the aggregate error arising from the discretized Euler scheme. We derive a randomized control companion, ART-RL, and formulate time change as a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) problem with Gaussian policies. We then prove that solving ART-RL recovers the optimal ART schedule, which in turn enables practical actor--critic updates to learn the latter in a data-driven way. Empirically, based on the official EDM pipeline, ART-RL improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance on CIFAR-10 over a wide range of budgets and transfers to AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet without the need of retraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research presents a few-shot voice cloning system for Nepali speakers, designed to synthesize speech in a specific speaker's voice from Devanagari text using minimal data. Voice cloning in Nepali remains largely unexplored due to its low-resource nature. To address this, we constructed separate datasets: untranscribed audio for training a speaker encoder and paired text-audio data for training a Tacotron2-based synthesizer. The speaker encoder, optimized with Generative End2End loss, generates embeddings that capture the speaker's vocal identity, validated through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction visualizations. These embeddings are fused with Tacotron2's text embeddings to produce mel-spectrograms, which are then converted into audio using a WaveRNN vocoder. Audio data were collected from various sources, including self-recordings, and underwent thorough preprocessing for quality and alignment. Training was performed using mel and gate loss functions under multiple hyperparameter settings. The system effectively clones speaker characteristics even for unseen voices, demonstrating the feasibility of few-shot voice cloning for the Nepali language and establishing a foundation for personalized speech synthesis in low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansheng Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Current paradigms in Deep Learning prioritize computational throughput over numerical precision, relying on the assumption that intelligence emerges from statistical correlation at scale. In this paper, we challenge this orthodoxy. We propose the Exactness Hypothesis: that General Intelligence (AGI), specifically high-order causal inference, requires a computational substrate capable of Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic. We argue that the "hallucinations" and logical incoherence seen in current Large Language Models (LLMs) are artifacts of IEEE 754 floating-point approximation errors accumulating over deep compositional functions. To mitigate this, we introduce the Halo Architecture, a paradigm shift to Rational Arithmetic ($\mathbb{Q}$) supported by a novel Exact Inference Unit (EIU). Empirical validation on the Huginn-0125 prototype demonstrates that while 600B-parameter scale BF16 baselines collapse in chaotic systems, Halo maintains zero numerical divergence indefinitely. This work establishes exact arithmetic as a prerequisite for reducing logical uncertainty in System 2 AGI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as more efficient alternatives to numerical solvers for physical simulations over complex geometries, such as car bodies. Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyuan Chen, Muchen Li, Renjie Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural dynamics of macromolecules is critical to their structural-function relationship. Cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) provides snapshots of vitrified protein at different compositional and conformational states, and the structural heterogeneity of proteins can be characterized through computational analysis of the images. For protein systems with multiple degrees of freedom, it is still challenging to disentangle and interpret the different modes of dynamics. Here, by implementing Point Transformer, a self-attention network designed for point cloud analysis, we are able to improve the performance of heterogeneity analysis on CryoEM data, and characterize the dynamics of highly complex protein systems in a more human-interpretable way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Judith Vilella-Cantos, Mauro Martini, Marcello Chiaberge, M\'onica Ballesta, David Valiente</p>
<p>Abstract: Localization in agricultural environments is challenging due to their unstructured nature and lack of distinctive landmarks. Although agricultural settings have been studied in the context of object classification and segmentation, the place recognition task for mobile robots is not trivial in the current state of the art. In this study, we propose MinkUNeXt-VINE, a lightweight, deep-learning-based method that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in vineyard environments thanks to its pre-processing and Matryoshka Representation Learning multi-loss approach. Our method prioritizes enhanced performance with low-cost, sparse LiDAR inputs and lower-dimensionality outputs to ensure high efficiency in real-time scenarios. Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data. The code is publicly available for reproduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact. We analyze all papers published at ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in 2024 and 2025, including main conference, Findings, and workshop papers. Our analysis reveals that nearly 300 papers contain at least one HalluCitation, most of which were published in 2025. Notably, half of these papers were identified at EMNLP 2025, the most recent conference, indicating that this issue is rapidly increasing. Moreover, more than 100 such papers were accepted as main conference and Findings papers at EMNLP 2025, affecting the credibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Tiezheng Yu, Fengbin Zhu, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua S. Gans</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems embed preferences either in training losses or through post-processing of calibrated predictions. Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision problem agnostic conditions under which separation training preference free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind, as documented in human AI decision-making, preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through post-processing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models and vision-languageaction models have significantly driven progress in Embodied AI. As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions. This shift is fueled by three primary factors: increasing agent capabilities, enhancing system efficiency through task delegation, and enabling advanced human-agent interactions. To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Antequera-S\'anchez, Juan Luis Su\'arez-D\'iaz, Rosana Montes, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Aavani</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern information retrieval is transitioning from simple document filtering to complex, neuro-symbolic reasoning workflows. However, current retrieval architectures face a fundamental efficiency dilemma when handling the rigorous logical and arithmetic constraints required by this new paradigm. Standard iterator-based engines (Document-at-a-Time) do not natively support complex, nested logic graphs; forcing them to execute such queries typically results in intractable runtime performance. Conversely, naive recursive approaches (Term-at-a-Time), while capable of supporting these structures, suffer from prohibitive memory consumption when enforcing broad logical exclusions.
  In this paper, we propose that a retrieval engine must be capable of ``Capturing $\mathbf{P}$'' -- evaluating any polynomial-time property directly over its index in a computationally efficient manner. We define a formal Retrieval Language ($\mathcal{L}_R$) based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and prove it precisely captures the complexity class $\mathbf{P}$. We introduce \texttt{ComputePN}, a novel evaluation algorithm that makes $\mathcal{L}_R$ tractable. By combining native DAG traversal with a memory-efficient ``Positive-Negative'' response mechanism, \texttt{ComputePN} ensures the efficient evaluation of any query in $\mathcal{L}_R$. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for turning the search index into a general-purpose computational engine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Amir Hosseini, Maryam Abdolali, Amirhosein Tavakkoli, Fardin Ayar, Ehsan Javanmardi, Manabu Tsukada, Mahdi Javanmardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) offers a promising alternative to explicit reward engineering by learning from pairwise trajectory comparisons. However, real-world preference data often comes from heterogeneous annotators with varying reliability; some accurate, some noisy, and some systematically adversarial. Existing PBRL methods either treat all feedback equally or attempt to filter out unreliable sources, but both approaches fail when faced with adversarial annotators who systematically provide incorrect preferences. We introduce TriTrust-PBRL (TTP), a unified framework that jointly learns a shared reward model and expert-specific trust parameters from multi-expert preference feedback. The key insight is that trust parameters naturally evolve during gradient-based optimization to be positive (trust), near zero (ignore), or negative (flip), enabling the model to automatically invert adversarial preferences and recover useful signal rather than merely discarding corrupted feedback. We provide theoretical analysis establishing identifiability guarantees and detailed gradient analysis that explains how expert separation emerges naturally during training without explicit supervision. Empirically, we evaluate TTP on four diverse domains spanning manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and locomotion (DM Control) under various corruption scenarios. TTP achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining near-oracle performance under adversarial corruption while standard PBRL methods fail catastrophically. Notably, TTP outperforms existing baselines by successfully learning from mixed expert pools containing both reliable and adversarial annotators, all while requiring no expert features beyond identification indices and integrating seamlessly with existing PBRL pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific discovery is often compromised by hallucinations. These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Abderrahmane Lakas, Merouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.
  We introduce $\alpha^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $\alpha^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $\alpha^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).
  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when augmented with search mechanisms that enable systematic exploration of external knowledge bases. The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Divekar, Anirban Majumder</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the quality of search, ranking and RAG systems traditionally requires a significant number of human relevance annotations. In recent times, several deployed systems have explored the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for this task while their inherent biases prevent direct use for metric estimation. We present a statistical framework extending Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that combines minimal human annotations with LLM judgments to produce reliable estimates of metrics which require sub-instance annotations. Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions). Detailed experiments across prominent retrieval datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the variance of estimates for the business-critical Precision@K metric, while effectively correcting for LLM bias in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Qu, Amrith Setlur, Virginia Smith, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepthi Pathare, Leo Laine, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani</p>
<p>Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and operational costs in highway driving poses a challenging decision-making problem for heavy-duty vehicles. A central difficulty is that conventional scalar reward formulations, obtained by aggregating these competing objectives, often obscure the structure of their trade-offs. We present a Proximal Policy Optimization based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that learns a continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs and evaluates it on a scalable simulation platform for tactical decision making in trucks. The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively. The resulting Pareto frontier is smooth and interpretable, enabling flexibility in choosing driving behavior along different conflicting objectives. This framework allows seamless transitions between different driving policies without retraining, yielding a robust and adaptive decision-making strategy for autonomous trucking applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a large-scale comparative study of 242 Latin and Cyrillic-script languages using subword-based methodologies. By constructing 'glottosets' from Wikipedia lexicons, we introduce a framework for simultaneous cross-linguistic comparison via Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). Our approach utilizes rank-based subword vectors to analyze vocabulary overlap, lexical divergence, and language similarity at scale. Evaluations demonstrate that BPE segmentation aligns with morpheme boundaries 95% better than random baseline across 15 languages (F1 = 0.34 vs 0.15). BPE vocabulary similarity correlates significantly with genetic language relatedness (Mantel r = 0.329, p < 0.001), with Romance languages forming the tightest cluster (mean distance 0.51) and cross-family pairs showing clear separation (0.82). Analysis of 26,939 cross-linguistic homographs reveals that 48.7% receive different segmentations across related languages, with variation correlating to phylogenetic distance. Our results provide quantitative macro-linguistic insights into lexical patterns across typologically diverse languages within a unified analytical framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrith Setlur, Zijian Wang, Andrew Cohen, Paria Rashidinejad, Sang Michael Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for LLM reasoning waste compute on hard problems, where correct on-policy traces are rare, policy gradients vanish, and learning stalls. To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text embeddings have become an essential part of a variety of language applications. However, methods for interpreting, exploring and reversing embedding spaces are limited, reducing transparency and precluding potentially valuable generative use cases. In this work, we align Large Language Models to embeddings of clinical trials using the recently reported Embedding Language Model (ELM) method. We develop an open-source, domain-agnostic ELM architecture and training framework, design training tasks for clinical trials, and introduce an expert-validated synthetic dataset. We then train a series of ELMs exploring the impact of tasks and training regimes. Our final model, ctELM, can accurately describe and compare unseen clinical trials from embeddings alone and produce plausible clinical trials from novel vectors. We further show that generated trial abstracts are responsive to moving embeddings along concept vectors for age and sex of study subjects. Our public ELM implementation and experimental results will aid the alignment of Large Language Models to embedding spaces in the biomedical domain and beyond.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11494">Mutagenesis screen to map the functions of parameters of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Hu, Gang Hu, Jixin Zheng, Patrick X. Zhao, Ruimeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks. Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shipeng Liu, Boshen Zhang, Zhehui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened transformative possibilities for human-robot collaboration. However, enabling real-time collaboration requires both low latency and robust reasoning, and most LLMs suffer from high latency. To address this gap, we first propose a fine-grained benchmark that explicitly assesses agents' proactive adaptability and temporal responsiveness in the Overcooked-AI environment. Based on evaluation results, we propose MonTA (Monitor-then-Adapt), a hierarchical framework inspired by cognitive science research. MonTA contains three key modules: a lightweight Monitor that operates at high frequency (7 Hz) to detect adaptation needs, and two proficient Adapters for subtask and path adaptation reasoning that provide instructions to humans at a lower frequency. Our results demonstrate that MonTA significantly outperforms baseline agents on our proposed benchmark, achieving superior performance across layouts with varying teaming fluency. User studies confirm the high reasonableness of adaptation plans and consistent language instructions provided by our framework to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M\'elissa Tamine, Benjamin Heymann, Patrick Loiseau, Maxime Vono</p>
<p>Abstract: Semivalue-based data valuation uses cooperative-game theory intuitions to assign each data point a value reflecting its contribution to a downstream task. Still, those values depend on the practitioner's choice of utility, raising the question: How robust is semivalue-based data valuation to changes in the utility? This issue is critical when the utility is set as a trade-off between several criteria and when practitioners must select among multiple equally valid utilities. We address it by introducing the notion of a dataset's spatial signature: given a semivalue, we embed each data point into a lower-dimensional space where any utility becomes a linear functional, making the data valuation framework amenable to a simpler geometric picture. Building on this, we propose a practical methodology centered on an explicit robustness metric that informs practitioners whether and by how much their data valuation results will shift as the utility changes. We validate this approach across diverse datasets and semivalues, demonstrating strong agreement with rank-correlation analyses and offering analytical insight into how choosing a semivalue can amplify or diminish robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Majurski, Cynthia Matuszek</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) continue to advance, improving response quality and coherence. Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered much of what users may ask them to generate in some form during their training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However, the human effort required for benchmark construction is rapidly being outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation. Having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in document populations. This work leverages the same LMs to evaluate domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g., a textbook) as input. This generative benchmarking approach corresponds well with human curated questions producing an ensemble Spearman ranking correlation of $0.91$ and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of $0.74$ (model specific $0.82$). This novel approach supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this methodology to evaluate model performance on three recent documents (two post LM knowledge cutoff), discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma-3 models on open-ended questions.

<p>Abstract: Reasoning in language models is difficult to evaluate: natural-language traces are unverifiable, symbolic datasets are too small, and most benchmarks conflate heuristics with inference. We present FOL-Traces, the first large-scale dataset of programmatically verified reasoning traces, enabling rigorous evaluation of structured logical inference. We also propose two challenging and comprehensive diagnostic tasks-masked operation prediction and step completion-that directly probe syntactic awareness and process fidelity. FOL-Traces serves as a scalable testbed for rigorously studying how models perform structured logical inference. Systematic experiments with 5 reasoning LLMs show that the dataset remains challenging: models only reach around 45.7% accuracy on masked operation prediction and around 27% on two-step completion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Controllable code generation, the ability to synthesize code that follows a specified style while maintaining functionality, remains a challenging task. We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialu Zhang, Chu-Min Li, Sami Cherif, Shuolin Li, Zhifei Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The Maximum Satisfiability problem (MaxSAT) is a major optimization challenge with numerous practical applications. In recent MaxSAT evaluations, most MaxSAT solvers have incorporated an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver into their portfolios. However, a good portfolio strategy requires a lot of tuning work and is limited to the profiling benchmark. This paper proposes a methodology to fully integrate ILP preprocessing techniques into the MaxSAT solving pipeline and investigates the impact on the top-performing MaxSAT solvers. Experimental results show that our approach helps to improve 5 out of 6 state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers, especially for WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024 on the unweighted track, which is able to solve 15 additional instances using our methodology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evangelos Georganas, Dhiraj Kalamkar, Alexander Heinecke</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp) used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model inference. We then extend this work to Intel GPUs where we design and implement mixed precision, 2-bit GEMM kernels, and show their performance to be close to optimal. We integrated our optimized Xe2 kernels in the vLLM framework as a quantization plugin and evaluated end-to-end LLM inference results for a range of LLM models and Xe2 GPUs. Depending on the model and platform, we see a 4x - 8x reduction in GEMM time compared to the BF16 case, and we get up to 6.3x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the BF16 execution. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs and Intel Xe GPUs, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinning Yang, Wenjie Sun, Wen Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present HeartLLM, a novel framework that integrates time-series (TS) and language modeling by enabling large language models (LLMs) to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into quantized codes using a lead-wise encoder and quantization module. These quantized codes are then mapped to an extended ECG vocabulary to form ECG tokens, enabling the model to process both ECG and natural language inputs within a unified framework. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG token forecasting task, allowing the LLM to capture temporal dynamics through its inherent language modeling capability. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, HeartLLM achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating discretized ECG tokens into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18880">Challenges for Generative AI in Legal Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eljas Linna, Tuula Linna</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains, yet their limitations in such high-stakes fields as law remain poorly understood. In response, this paper introduces examples of critical challenges to the functioning of generative and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) as reliable reasoning tools in judicial decision-making. The study deconstructs core requirements and challenges for AI, including the ability to select the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments based on the doctrine of the sources of law, distinguish ratio decidendi and obiter dicta in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like "reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and apply the burden of proof correctly. The paper maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent systems and neuro-symbolic AI, to these challenges, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of legal interpretation. Furthermore, the paper sketches a path towards an evaluation framework, proposing that legal requirements be organized into normative, doctrinal, evidential, and technical categories, and subsequently operationalized into domain-specific, testable design obligations. The findings indicate that these techniques can address specific narrow challenges, but they fail to solve the more significant ones, particularly in tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Therefore, we advocate for a staged adoption, first capturing efficiency in simple cases with technology already available today and sustaining long-term investment in new methods that handle hierarchy, temporality, and other requirements of legally sound reasoning, thus enabling expansion to complex adjudication in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on a human-led thematic analysis of life-story interviews with inpatients with Borderline Personality Disorder, this study examines the capacity of large language models (OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude) to support qualitative clinical analysis. The models were evaluated through a mixed procedure. Study A involved blinded and non-blinded expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients for overlap of outputs, multidimensional validity ratings of credibility, coherence, and the substantiveness of results, and their grounding in qualitative data. In Study B, neural methods were used to embed the theme descriptions created by humans and the models in a two-dimensional vector space to provide a computational measure of the difference between human and model semantics and linguistic style. In Study C, complementary non-expert evaluations were conducted to examine the influence of thematic verbosity on the perception of human authorship and content validity. Results of all three studies revealed variable overlap with the human analysis, with models being partly indistinguishable from, and also identifying themes originally omitted by, human researchers. The findings highlight both the variability and potential of AI-augmented thematic qualitative analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias and enhance sensitivity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Zhu, Spencer Hong, Jingyu Wu, Kushal Chawla, Charlotte Tang, Youbing Yin, Nathan Wolfe, Erin Babinsky, Daben Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of complex, interconnected long-horizon LLM systems has made it incredibly tricky to identify where and when these systems break down. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today are limited in that they often focus on simple metrics, end-to-end outcomes, and are dependent on the perspectives of humans. In order to match the increasing complexity of these many component systems, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the nuanced logic passing through these systems. In this paper, we present RAFFLES, an offline evaluation architecture that incorporates iterative reasoning. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically identify faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess the quality of the candidate faults as well as rationales of the Judge. We evaluated RAFFLES with several benchmarks - the Who&When dataset to identify step-level faults in multi-agent systems and the ReasonEval datasets to diagnose step-level mathematical reasoning errors. RAFFLES outperforms strong baselines, achieving an accuracy of over 20% and 50% on the Who&When Hand-Crafted and Algorithmically-Generated datasets, and over 80% on the ReasonEval datasets. These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual review.</p>

<p>Abstract: Markets increasingly accommodate large language models (LLMs) as autonomous decision-making agents. As this transition occurs, it becomes critical to evaluate how these agents behave relative to their human and task-specific statistical predecessors. In this work, we present results from an empirical study comparing humans (N=216), multiple frontier LLMs, and customized Bayesian agents in dynamic multi-player bargaining games under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus with aggressive trade proposals that are frequently rejected. Humans and LLMs achieve comparable aggregate surplus within their groups, but exhibit different trading strategies. LLMs favor conservative, concessionary proposals that are usually accepted by other LLMs, while humans propose trades that are consistent with fairness norms but are more likely to be rejected. These findings highlight that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can mask substantive procedural differences in how LLMs behave in complex multi-agent interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Taherin, Juyi Lin, Arash Akbari, Arman Akbari, Pu Zhao, Weiwei Chen, David Kaeli, Yanzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 18 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. For closed-source models lacking token-level logprob access, we develop and validate instruction-guided likelihood proxies. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Liu, Haoyang Shang, Haojian Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behavior through implicit natural-language descriptions often do not yield consistent behavior across models, and the resulting behavior does not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA introduces a model-agnostic way to control agent behavior that lets researchers explicitly specify desired nuances and obtain consistent behavior across models. At the heart of CoBRA is a novel closed-loop system primitive with two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the demonstrated cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classic social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to exhibit controlled cognitive bias. Through CoBRA, we show how to operationalize validated social science knowledge (i.e., classical experiments) as reusable "gym" environments for AI -- an approach that may generalize to richer social and affective simulations beyond bias alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships remains limited. Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Wang, Duo Wu, Shaokang He, Jinghe Wang, Linjia Kang, Jing Yu, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents--a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a Collaborative Belief World--an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse external open-world knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief representation module, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 64-79% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyao Zhang, Xinglang Zhang, Junxi Sheng, Wenbing Li, Junqing Yu, Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen, Wei Yang, Zikai Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models. However, existing studies often overlook the interaction between logical complexity and semantic complexity, leading to systems that struggle with abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances that are central to human reasoning. We propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework that jointly addresses these two axes of difficulty. The semiotic square provides a principled structure for multi-perspective semantic analysis, and LogicAgent integrates automated deduction with reflective verification to manage logical complexity across deeper reasoning chains. To support evaluation under these conditions, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that couples semantic complexity with logical depth. RepublicQA reaches college-level semantic difficulty (FKGL 11.94), contains philosophically grounded abstract propositions with systematically constructed contrary and contradictory forms, and offers a semantically rich setting for assessing logical reasoning in large language models. Experiments show that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA with a 6.25 percent average improvement over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05 percent average gain. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in enhancing logical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele D'Acunto, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Sergio Barbarossa</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to improve explainability, robustness, and trustworthiness by leveraging causal models. Recent work has shown that sheaf-theoretic approaches offer a principled framework for representing and aligning causal knowledge across collections of subjective and imperfect causal models connected by relational structures. In this work, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a general sheaf-theoretic framework for representing, learning, and reasoning across collections of mixture causal models (MCMs). CAN formalizes causal abstraction relations among subjective MCMs operating at different levels of granularity, while remaining agnostic to explicit causal graphs, functional mechanisms, interventional data, or jointly sampled observations. At the theoretical level, we provide a categorical formulation of MCMs and characterize key properties of CANs, including consistency, smoothness, and the existence of global sections, which are related to spectral properties of an associated combinatorial Laplacian. At the methodological level, we address the problem of learning consistent CANs from data by exploiting the compositionality of causal abstractions and necessary conditions for their existence. The learning task decomposes into local problems on the network edges, for which we propose efficient solutions in Gaussian and Gaussian mixture settings. We validate the proposed learning methods on synthetic data and illustrate the practical relevance of the CAN framework through a financial application, demonstrating both recovery and counterfactual reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiqiang Wu, Runming Yang, Tao Liu, Jiahao Wang, Ngai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies. Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Indrajith Ekanayake, Sanjula De Alwis</p>
<p>Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However, many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination, these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions, thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer loyalty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert West, Ashton Anderson, Ece Kamar, Eric Horvitz</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently hallucinate due to their reliance on fragile, linear reasoning and weak visual grounding. We propose Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a reinforcement learning framework that reformulates reasoning as a hierarchical search with self-verification. VAR enforces traceable evidence grounding by generating explicit bounding boxes, guided by a novel reward function combining geometric precision and semantic sufficiency. Furthermore, it replaces linear Chain-of-Thought with a tree-search policy capable of backtracking to correct logical errors. Theoretical analysis validates the framework's reliability, and extensive experiments demonstrate that VAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex hallucination and safety benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassir Lairgi, Ludovic Moncla, Khalid Benabdeslem, R\'emy Cazabet, Pierre Cl\'eau</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG) construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained "atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it constructs atomic TKGs from these facts, employing a dual-time modeling that distinguishes between when information is observed and when it is valid. The resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~33% better stability, and over ~90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods, demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengru Fang, Yu Guo, Jingjing Wang, Yuang Zhang, Haonan An, Yinhai Wang, Wenbo Ding, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing a consistent shared spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulates coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Through an information bottleneck objective, this framework prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations-an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further utilized by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to collective intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajian Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Yucong Luo, Xiaoyu Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Table reasoning with large language models (LLMs) plays a critical role in building intelligent systems capable of understanding and analyzing tabular data. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face key limitations: their reasoning processes lacks depth and explicit multi-step reasoning, often relying solely on implicit language model understanding. In addition, their reasoning processes suffer from instability, primarily caused by model uncertainty. In this work, we propose STaR, a novel slow-thinking model that can achieve effective and stable table reasoning. To enable effective multi-step reasoning, we design a two-stage training framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up followed by reinforced fine-tuning (RFT). Specifically, in the SFT stage, we construct a high-quality dataset through automatic self-verification. In the RFT stage, we introduce a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning mechanism to further enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, to improve reasoning stability, we introduce trajectory-level uncertainty quantification, which fuses token-level confidence with answer-level consistency, enabling the selection of better reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STaR-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks and exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its potential for enhancing both effectiveness and stability in table reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Gao, Shaohan Yu, Zerui Chen, Yueming Lyu, Weichen Yu, Guanghao Li, Jiyao Liu, Jianxiong Gao, Jian Liang, Ziwei Liu, Chenyang Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved problem-solving through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this capability creates a Safety-Helpfulness Paradox: the reasoning process itself can be misused to justify harmful actions or conceal malicious intent behind lengthy intermediate steps. Most existing benchmarks only check the final output, missing how risks evolve, or ``drift'', during the model's internal reasoning. To address this, we propose SafeRBench, the first framework to evaluate LRM safety end-to-end, from the initial input to the reasoning trace and final answer. Our approach introduces: (i) a Risk Stratification Probing that uses specific risk levels to stress-test safety boundaries beyond simple topics; (ii) Micro-Thought Analysis, a new chunking method that segments traces to pinpoint exactly where safety alignment breaks down; and (iii) a comprehensive suite of 10 fine-grained metrics that, for the first time, jointly measure a model's Risk Exposure (e.g., risk level, execution feasibility) and Safety Awareness (e.g., intent awareness). Experiments on 19 LRMs reveal that while enabling Thinking modes improves safety in mid-sized models, it paradoxically increases actionable risks in larger models due to a strong always-help tendency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metric knowledge is inherently structured, connecting industries, reporting frameworks, metric categories, metrics, and calculation models through compositional dependencies, yet in practice this structure remains embedded implicitly in regulatory documents such as SASB, TCFD, and IFRS S2 and rarely exists as an explicit, governed, or machine-actionable artefact. Existing ESG ontologies define formal schemas but do not address scalable population and governance from authoritative regulatory sources, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction frequently produces semantically incorrect entities, hallucinated relationships, and structurally invalid graphs. OntoMetric is an ontology-guided framework for the automated construction and governance of ESG metric knowledge graphs from regulatory documents that operationalises the ESG Metric Knowledge Graph (ESGMKG) ontology as a first-class constraint embedded directly into the extraction and population process. The framework integrates structure-aware segmentation, ontology-constrained LLM extraction enriched with semantic fields and deterministic identifiers, and two-phase validation combining semantic type verification with rule-based schema checking, while preserving segment-level and page-level provenance to ensure traceability to regulatory source text. Evaluation on five ESG regulatory standards shows that ontology-guided extraction achieves 65-90 percent semantic accuracy and over 80 percent schema compliance, compared with 3-10 percent for unconstrained baseline extraction, and yields stable cost efficiency with a cost per validated entity of 0.01-0.02 USD and a 48 times efficiency improvement over baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wang,  Aniri, Tianlong Chen, Yue Zhang, Heng Tao Shen, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty estimators fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect outputs, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To this end, we propose LEC, a principled framework that reframes selective prediction as a decision problem governed by a linear expectation constraint over selection and error indicators. Under this formulation, we derive a finite-sample sufficient condition that relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration data, enabling the computation of an FDR-constrained, retention-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to two-model routing systems: if the primary model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, the input is delegated to a subsequent model, while maintaining system-level FDR control. Experiments on both closed-ended and open-ended question answering (QA) and vision question answering (VQA) demonstrate that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention compared to prior approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Envy shapes competitiveness and cooperation in human groups, yet its role in large language model interactions remains largely unexplored. As LLMs increasingly operate in multi-agent settings, it is important to examine whether they exhibit envy-like preferences under social comparison. We evaluate LLM behavior across two scenarios: (1) a point-allocation game testing sensitivity to relative versus absolute payoff, and (2) comparative evaluations across general and contextual settings. To ground our analysis in psychological theory, we adapt four established psychometric questionnaires spanning general, domain-specific, workplace, and sibling-based envy. Our results reveal heterogeneous envy-like patterns across models and contexts, with some models sacrificing personal gain to reduce a peer's advantage, while others prioritize individual maximization. These findings highlight competitive dispositions as a design and safety consideration for multi-agent LLM systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods (algorithms) in societal systems, but their cost and latency bottleneck rapid methodological progress. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the method's identity or provenance (method-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.</p>

To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Wang, Sendong Zhao, Jiatong Liu, Haochun Wang, Wanting Li, Bing Qin, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated superior performance over single-agent approaches in complex reasoning tasks, they often suffer from significant computational inefficiencies. Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shouju Wang, Haopeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce T3 (Testing Trustworthy Thinking), a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality. Comprising 454 expert-curated vignettes, T3 prioritizes high-resolution failure analysis, decomposing performance into Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal on underdetermined cases. By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a "Skepticism Trap" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination. Finally, we use the benchmark to validate a process-verified protocol (RCA), showing that T3 successfully captures the restoration of decisive causal judgment under structured verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Luo, Yebo Feng, Jiahua Xu, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Copy trading has become the dominant entry strategy in meme coin markets. However, due to the market's extreme illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from na\"ive copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists. We propose a manipulation-resistant copy-trading system based on a multi-agent architecture powered by a multi-modal, explainable large language model (LLM). Our system decomposes copy trading into three specialized agents for coin evaluation, wallet selection, and timing assessment. Evaluated on historical data from over 6,000 meme coins, our approach outperforms zero-shot and most statistic-driven baselines in prediction accuracy as well as all baselines in economic performance, achieving an average return of 14% for identified smart-money trades and an estimated copier return of 3% per trade under realistic market frictions. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agent-based defenses and predictability of trader profitability in adversarial meme coin markets, providing a practical foundation for robust copy trading.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zenghua Liao, Jinzhi Liao, Xiang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuo Liang, Yuhang Lu, Jianming Mao, Shuyi Sun, Chunwei Yang, Congcong Zeng, Xiao Jin, Hanzhang Qin, Ruihao Zhu, Chung-Piaw Teo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. The agentic workflow leverages common modeling practices to standardize the modeling process into a sequence of structured sub-tasks, offloading mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This reduces the LLM's burden in planning and data handling, allowing us to exploit its flexibility to address unstructured components. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Minh Phuong, Dang Huu Tien, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead or depend on external components, which limit their scalability. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks, enabling reasoning to emerge within the model itself-improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks, and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Cai, Zhouhong Gu, Juntao Zhang, Ping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans face countless scenarios that require reasoning and judgment in daily life. However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shirin Shahabi, Spencer Graham, Haruna Isah</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures reasoning models not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Lian, Bin Yu, Xiaopeng Lin, Laurence T. Yang, Zhaolong Shen, Changti Wu, Yuzhuo Miao, Cong Huang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been introduced as a method to sample a diverse set of candidates in an active learning context, with a training objective that makes them approximately sample in proportion to a given reward function. In this paper, we show a number of additional theoretical properties of GFlowNets. They can be used to estimate joint probability distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions where some variables are unspecified and, of particular interest, can represent distributions over composite objects like sets and graphs. GFlowNets amortize the work typically done by computationally expensive MCMC methods in a single but trained generative pass. They could also be used to estimate partition functions and free energies, conditional probabilities of supersets (supergraphs) given a subset (subgraph), as well as marginal distributions over all supersets (supergraphs) of a given set (graph). We introduce variations enabling the estimation of entropy and mutual information, sampling from a Pareto frontier, connections to reward-maximizing policies, and extensions to stochastic environments, continuous actions and modular energy functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general framework for sequential decision-making under latent state uncertainty, yet learning in POMDPs is intractable in the worst case. Motivated by sensing and probing constraints in practice, we study how much online state information (OSI) is sufficient to enable efficient learning guarantees. We formalize a model in which the learner can query only partial OSI (POSI) during interaction. We first prove an information-theoretic hardness result showing that, for general POMDPs, achieving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy can require sample complexity that is exponential unless full OSI is available. We then identify two structured subclasses that remain learnable under POSI and propose corresponding algorithms with provably efficient performance guarantees. In particular, we establish regret upper bounds with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$ dependence on the number of episodes $K$, together with complementary lower bounds, thereby delineating when POSI suffices for efficient reinforcement learning. Our results highlight a principled separation between intractable and tractable regimes under incomplete online state access and provide new tools for jointly optimizing POSI queries and learning control actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuran Li, Hao Xue, Peng Wu, Xingjun Ma, Zhen Zhang, Huaming Chen, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that degrade both predictive accuracy and individual fairness, posing critical risks in high-stakes online decision-making. The relationship between these two dimensions of robustness remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce robust individual fairness (RIF), which requires that similar individuals receive predictions consistent with the same ground truth even under adversarial manipulation. To evaluate and expose violations of RIF, we propose RIFair, an attack framework that applies identical perturbations to similar individuals to induce accuracy or fairness failures. We further introduce perturbation impact index (PII) and perturbation impact direction (PID) to quantify and explain why identical perturbations produce unequal effects on individuals who should behave similarly. Experiments across diverse model architectures and real-world web datasets reveal that existing robustness metrics capture distinct and often incompatible failure modes in accuracy and fairness. We find that many online applicants are simultaneously vulnerable to multiple types of adversarial failures, and that inaccurate or unfair outcomes arise due to similar individuals share the same PID but have sharply different PIIs, leading to divergent prediction-change trajectories in which some cross decision boundaries earlier. Finally, we demonstrate that adversarial examples generated by RIFair can strategically manipulate test-set accuracy or fairness by replacing only a small subset of items, creating misleading impressions of model performance. These findings expose fundamental limitations in current robustness evaluations and highlight the need for jointly assessing accuracy and fairness under adversarial perturbations in high-stakes online decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: The softmax activation function plays a crucial role in the success of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the self-attention mechanism of the widely adopted Transformer architecture. However, the underlying learning dynamics that contribute to the effectiveness of softmax remain largely unexplored. As a step towards better understanding, this paper provides a theoretical study of the optimization and generalization properties of two-layer softmax neural networks, providing theoretical insights into their superior performance as other activation functions, such as ReLU and exponential. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, our analysis reveals that the normalization effect of the softmax function leads to a good perturbation property of the induced NTK matrix, resulting in a good convex region of the loss landscape. Consequently, softmax neural networks can learn the target function in the over-parametrization regime. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our theoretical findings, we apply them to the task of learning score estimation functions in diffusion models, a promising approach for generative modeling. Our analysis shows that gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of softmax neural networks and their potential in various domains, paving the way for further advancements in natural language processing and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tensor Attention, a multi-view attention that is able to capture high-order correlations among multiple modalities, can overcome the representational limitations of classical matrix attention. However, the $O(n^3)$ time complexity of tensor attention poses a significant obstacle to its utilization in transformers, where $n$ is the input sequence length. In this work, we prove that the backward gradient of tensor attention training can be computed in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$, the same complexity as its forward computation under the bounded entries assumption. We provide a closed-form solution for the gradient and propose a fast computation method utilizing polynomial approximation methods and tensor algebraic techniques. Furthermore, we prove the necessity and tightness of our assumption through hardness analysis, showing that slightly weakening it renders the gradient problem unsolvable in truly subcubic time. Our theoretical results establish the feasibility of efficient higher-order transformer training and may facilitate practical applications of tensor attention architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnieszka Niemczynowicz, Rados{\l}aw Antoni Kycia</p>
<p>Abstract: A fully tensorial theoretical framework for hypercomplex-valued neural networks is presented. The proposed approach enables neural network architectures to operate on data defined over arbitrary finite-dimensional algebras. The central observation is that algebra multiplication can be represented by a rank-three tensor, which allows all algebraic operations in neural network layers to be formulated in terms of standard tensor contractions, permutations, and reshaping operations.
  This tensor-based formulation provides a unified and dimension-independent description of hypercomplex-valued dense and convolutional layers and is directly compatible with modern deep learning libraries supporting optimized tensor operations. The proposed framework recovers existing constructions for four-dimensional algebras as a special case.
  Within this setting, a tensor-based version of the universal approximation theorem for single-layer hypercomplex-valued perceptrons is established under mild non-degeneracy assumptions on the underlying algebra, thereby providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for the considered class of neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lilla Vicsek, Anna Vancs\'o, Mike Zajko, Judit Takacs</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous discussions have highlighted the need for generative AI tools to become more culturally sensitive, yet often neglect the complexities of handling content about minorities, who are perceived differently across cultures and religions. Our study examined how two generative AI systems respond to homophobic statements with varying cultural and religious context information. Findings showed ChatGPT 3.5's replies exhibited cultural relativism, in contrast to Bard's, which stressed human rights and provided more support for LGBTQ+ issues. Both demonstrated significant change in responses based on contextual information provided in the prompts, suggesting that AI systems may adjust in their responses the degree and forms of support for LGBTQ+ people according to information they receive about the user's background. The study contributes to understanding the social and ethical implications of AI responses and argues that any work to make generative AI outputs more culturally diverse requires a grounding in fundamental human rights.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eashan Adhikarla, Kai Zhang, Rosaura G. VidalMata, Manjushree Aithal, Nikhil Ambha Madhusudhana, John Nicholson, Lichao Sun, Brian D. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent strides made by AI in image processing, the issue of mixed exposure, pivotal in many real-world scenarios like surveillance and photography, remains inadequately addressed. Traditional image enhancement techniques and current transformer models are limited with primary focus on either overexposure or underexposure. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified-Exposure Guided Transformer (Unified-EGformer). Our proposed solution is built upon advanced transformer architectures, equipped with local pixel-level refinement and global refinement blocks for color correction and image-wide adjustments. We employ a guided attention mechanism to precisely identify exposure-compromised regions, ensuring its adaptability across various real-world conditions. U-EGformer, with a lightweight design featuring a memory footprint (peak memory) of only $\sim$1134 MB (0.1 Million parameters) and an inference time of 95 ms (9.61x faster than the average), is a viable choice for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. Additionally, our model is highly generalizable, requiring minimal fine-tuning to handle multiple tasks and datasets with a single architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Kuleshov, Evgenia Romanenkova, Vladislav Zhuzhel, Galina Boeva, Evgeni Vorsin, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eashan Adhikarla, Kai Zhang, Gong Chen, John Nicholson, Brian D. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a persistent challenge in computer vision, where state-of-the-art models are often hampered by hardware constraints and computational inefficiency, particularly at high resolutions. While foundational architectures like transformers and diffusion models have advanced the field, their computational complexity limits their deployment on edge devices. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates a frequency-aware state-space model within a modified U-Net. ExpoMamba is designed to address mixed-exposure challenges by decoupling the modeling of amplitude (intensity) and phase (structure) in the frequency domain. This allows for targeted enhancement, making it highly effective for real-time applications, including downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ExpoMamba is up to 2-3x faster than competing models and achieves a 6.8\% PSNR improvement, establishing a new state-of-the-art in efficient, high-quality low-light enhancement.

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superhuman performance on standardized medical licensing exams, these static benchmarks have become saturated and increasingly disconnected from the functional requirements of clinical workflows. To bridge the gap between theoretical capability and verified utility, we introduce MEDIC, a comprehensive evaluation framework establishing leading indicators across various clinical dimensions. Beyond standard question-answering, we assess operational capabilities using deterministic execution protocols and a novel Cross-Examination Framework (CEF), which quantifies information fidelity and hallucination rates without reliance on reference texts. Our evaluation across a heterogeneous task suite exposes critical performance trade-offs: we identify a significant knowledge-execution gap, where proficiency in static retrieval does not predict success in operational tasks such as clinical calculation or SQL generation. Furthermore, we observe a divergence between passive safety (refusal) and active safety (error detection), revealing that models fine-tuned for high refusal rates often fail to reliably audit clinical documentation for factual accuracy. These findings demonstrate that no single architecture dominates across all dimensions, highlighting the necessity of a portfolio approach to clinical model deployment. As part of this investigation, we released a public leaderboard on Hugging Face.\footnote{https://huggingface.co/spaces/m42-health/MEDIC-Benchmark}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt Y. Cheung, Tucker J. Netherton, Laurence E. Court, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Guha Balakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable confidence measures of metrics derived from medical imaging reconstruction pipelines would improve the standard of decision-making in many clinical workflows. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a robust framework for producing calibrated prediction intervals, but standard CP formulations face a critical challenge in the imaging pipeline: common mismatches between image reconstruction objectives and downstream metrics can introduce systematic prediction deviations from ground truth values, known as bias. These biases in turn compromise the efficiency of prediction intervals, which is a problem that has been unexplored in the CP literature. In this study, we formalize the behavior of symmetric (where bounds expand equally in both directions) and asymmetric (where bounds expand unequally) formulations for common non-conformity scores in CP in the presence of bias, and argue that this measurable bias must inform the choice of CP formulation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that symmetric intervals are inflated by a factor of two times the magnitude of bias while asymmetric intervals remain unaffected by bias, and provide conditions under which each formulation produces tighter intervals. We empirically validated our theoretical analyses on sparse-view CT reconstruction for downstream radiotherapy planning. Our work enables users of medical imaging pipelines to proactively select optimal CP formulations, thereby improving interval length efficiency for critical downstream metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyuwan Kim, Yang Li, Evangelia Spiliopoulou, Jie Ma, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific example was used to train a given language model. While prior work has explored prompt-based attacks such as ReCALL, these methods rely heavily on the assumption that using known non-members as prompts reliably suppresses the model's responses to non-member queries. We propose EM-MIA, a new membership inference approach that iteratively refines prefix effectiveness and membership scores using an expectation-maximization strategy without requiring labeled non-member examples. To support controlled evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark that enables analysis of MIA robustness under systematically varied distributional overlap and difficulty. Experiments on WikiMIA and OLMoMIA show that EM-MIA outperforms existing baselines, particularly in settings with clear distributional separability. We highlight scenarios where EM-MIA succeeds in practical settings with partial distributional overlap, while failure cases expose fundamental limitations of current MIA methods under near-identical conditions. We release our code and evaluation pipeline to encourage reproducible and robust MIA research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolving landscape of edge computing envisions platforms operating as dynamic intermediaries between application providers and edge servers (ESs), where task offloading is coupled with payments for computational services. Ensuring efficient resource utilization and meeting stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements necessitates incentivizing ESs while optimizing the platforms operational objectives. This paper investigates a multi-agent system where both the platform and ESs are self-interested entities, addressing the joint optimization of revenue maximization, resource allocation, and task offloading. We propose a novel Stackelberg game-based framework to model interactions between stakeholders and solve the optimization problem using a Bayesian Optimization-based centralized algorithm. Recognizing practical challenges in information collection due to privacy concerns, we further design a decentralized solution leveraging neural network optimization and a privacy-preserving information exchange protocol. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Cao, Jiayan Huo, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings of bounded entries (i.e., in time $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens), but has not addressed backward computation. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Looped Transformers have shown exceptional neural algorithmic reasoning capability in simulating traditional graph algorithms, but their application to more complex structures like hypergraphs remains underexplored. Hypergraphs generalize graphs by modeling higher-order relationships among multiple entities, enabling richer representations but introducing significant computational challenges. In this work, we extend the Loop Transformer architecture's neural algorithmic reasoning capability to simulate hypergraph algorithms, addressing the gap between neural networks and combinatorial optimization over hypergraphs. Specifically, we propose a novel degradation mechanism for reducing hypergraphs to graph representations, enabling the simulation of graph-based algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path. Furthermore, we introduce a hyperedge-aware encoding scheme to simulate hypergraph-specific algorithms, exemplified by Helly's algorithm. We establish theoretical guarantees for these simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of processing high-dimensional and combinatorial data using Loop Transformers. This work highlights the potential of Transformers as general-purpose algorithmic solvers for structured data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Jianda Chen, Juntao Yang, Jeff Adie, Simon See, Kalli Furtado, Chen Chen, Troy Arcomano, Romit Maulik, Wei Xue, Gianmarco Mengaldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient climate simulations are crucial for understanding Earth's evolving climate. However, current general circulation models (GCMs) face challenges in capturing unresolved physical processes, such as cloud and convection. A common solution is to adopt cloud resolving models, that provide more accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrisation schemes typically used in GCMs. However, cloud resolving models, also referred to as super paramtetrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling, which integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising alternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues. In this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a key factor compromising the stability of hybrid models. To address this, we introduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a self-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes. CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing simulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency compared to super parameterization schemes.
  We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained Neural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term stable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land. PCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it shows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the way for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejas Srinivasan, Jesse Thomason</p>
<p>Abstract: Trust biases how users rely on AI recommendations in AI-assisted decision-making tasks, with low and high levels of trust resulting in increased under- and over-reliance, respectively. We propose that AI assistants should adapt their behavior through trust-adaptive interventions to mitigate such inappropriate reliance. For instance, when user trust is low, providing an explanation can elicit more careful consideration of the assistant's advice by the user. In two decision-making scenarios -- laypeople answering science questions and doctors making medical diagnoses -- we find that providing supporting and counter-explanations during moments of low and high trust, respectively, yields up to 38% reduction in inappropriate reliance and 20% improvement in decision accuracy. We are similarly able to reduce over-reliance by adaptively inserting forced pauses to promote deliberation. Our results highlight how AI adaptation to user trust facilitates appropriate reliance, presenting exciting avenues for improving human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghua Huang, Lu Wang, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Zhixu Li, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore how directly pretraining a value model simplifies and stabilizes reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In reinforcement learning, value estimation is the key to policy optimization, distinct from reward supervision. The value function predicts the \emph{return-to-go} of a partial answer, that is, how promising the partial answer is if it were continued to completion. In RLHF, however, the standard pipeline first pretrains a reward model and then learns a value function online, even though no new reward signals are available once preference data is collected. This makes critic learning redundant, as the process of training a reward model and then deriving a value model is informationally equivalent to directly pretraining a value model. Importantly, this requires no additional supervision, and our value model is trained on exactly the same data used for reward modeling. Building on this insight, we introduce \emph{Decoupled Value Policy Optimization} (DVPO), a framework that pretrains a \emph{Global Value Model} (GVM) offline and freezes it as a universal critic for policy learning. The GVM provides stable, fine-grained credit assignment without critic drift or trajectory sampling. Experiments across MT-Bench, Alpaca-Eval, and Arena-Hard demonstrate that DVPO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art RLHF methods. These results highlight RLHF can be reframed as policy-only optimization guided by a single pretrained value model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying language models often requires navigating accuracy vs. performance trade-offs to meet latency constraints while preserving utility. Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training, thereby improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Mu, Sen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jes\'us Garc\'ia Fern\'andez, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: The pursuit of energy-efficient and adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) has positioned neuromorphic computing as a promising alternative to conventional computing. However, achieving learning on these platforms requires techniques that prioritize local information while enabling effective credit assignment. Here, we propose noise-based reward-modulated learning (NRL), a novel synaptic plasticity rule that mathematically unifies reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization with biologically-inspired local updates. NRL addresses the computational bottleneck of exact gradients by approximating them through stochastic neural activity, transforming the inherent noise of biological and neuromorphic substrates into a functional resource. Drawing inspiration from biological learning, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and eligibility traces to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks, featuring immediate and delayed rewards, shows that NRL achieves performance comparable to baselines optimized using backpropagation, although with slower convergence, while showing significantly superior performance and scalability in multi-layer networks compared to reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), the most prominent similar approach. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in computing substrates with locality constraints. NRL offers a theoretically grounded paradigm well-suited for the event-driven characteristics of next-generation neuromorphic AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) enables models to learn new classes from limited labelled samples, making it promising for IoT applications where manual labelling is costly. However, existing studies focus on accuracy while ignoring deployment viability on resource-constrained hardware. Thus, we present MetaCLBench, a benchmark framework that evaluates Meta-CL methods for both accuracy and deployment-critical metrics (memory footprint, latency, and energy consumption) on real IoT devices with RAM sizes ranging from 512 MB to 4 GB. We evaluate six Meta-CL methods across three architectures (CNN, YAMNet, ViT) and five datasets spanning image and audio modalities. Our evaluation reveals that, depending on the dataset, up to three of six methods cause out-of-memory failures on sub-1 GB devices, significantly narrowing viable deployment options. LifeLearner achieves near-oracle accuracy while consuming 2.54-7.43x less energy than the Oracle method. Notably, larger or more sophisticated architectures such as ViT and YAMNet do not necessarily yield better Meta-CL performance, with results varying across datasets and modalities, challenging conventional assumptions about model complexity. Finally, we provide practical deployment guidelines and will release our framework upon publication to enable fair evaluation across both accuracy and system-level metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) show that large language models enhance their reasoning abilities when trained with verifiable signals. However, due to reward sparsity, effectiveness depends heavily on selecting samples of appropriate difficulty. In this work, we present a formal analysis of online difficulty-aware filtering and establish its theoretical foundations. We show that expected policy improvement is lower-bounded by the variance of task-level success probabilities, implying that selecting tasks of intermediate difficulty maximizes learning efficiency. Building on this, we demonstrate that balanced filtering maximizes this lower bound, leading to superior performance and sample efficiency. Evaluations across multiple math reasoning benchmarks validate that balanced filtering consistently enhances convergence speed and final performance, achieving up to +12% gains in less than half the training steps of standard GRPO. By extending our analysis to various reward distributions, we provide a principled foundation for future RLVR curriculum strategies, confirmed through both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabaat Haroon, Ahmad Faraz Khan, Ahmad Humayun, Waris Gill, Abdul Haddi Amjad, Ali R. Butt, Mohammad Taha Khan, Muhammad Ali Gulzar</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in non-generative software maintenance tasks, such as fault localization (FL). Success in FL depends on a models ability to reason about program semantics beyond surface-level syntactic and lexical features. However, widely used LLM benchmarks primarily evaluate code generation, which differs fundamentally from semantic program reasoning. Meanwhile, traditional FL benchmarks such as Defect4J and BugsInPy are either not scalable or obsolete, as their datasets have become part of LLM training data, leading to biased results. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into the robustness of LLMs fault localizability. Inspired by mutation testing, we develop an end-to-end evaluation framework that addresses key limitations in existing LLM evaluation, including data contamination, scalability, automation, and extensibility. Using real-world programs with specifications, we inject unseen faults and ask LLMs to localize them, filtering out underspecified programs where localization is ambiguous. For each successfully localized program, we apply semantic-preserving mutations (SPMs) and rerun localization to assess robustness and determine whether LLM reasoning relies on syntactic cues rather than semantics. We evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on 750,013 fault localization tasks from over 1,300 Java and Python programs. We find that SPMs cause LLMs to fail on previously localized faults in 78% of cases, and that reasoning is stronger when relevant code appears earlier in context. These results indicate that LLM code reasoning is often tied to features irrelevant to semantics. We also identify code patterns that are challenging for LLMs to reason about. Overall, our findings motivate fundamental advances in how LLMs represent, interpret, and prioritize code semantics to reason more deeply about program logic</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anandatheertha Bapu, Thomas Chen, Chun-Kai Kevin Chien, Patricia Mu\~noz Ewald, Andrew G. Moore</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove a uniform generalization bound that is independent of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments of our theoretical results with MNIST, and obtain agreement with the true test error within a 22 % margin on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gemma E. Moran, Bryon Aragam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) rely on machine learning techniques such as deep learning and generative modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance across wide-ranging domains. These methods' surprising performance is due in part to their ability to learn implicit "representations" of complex, multi-modal data. Unfortunately, deep neural networks are notoriously black boxes that obscure these representations, making them difficult to interpret or analyze. To resolve these difficulties, one approach is to build new interpretable neural network models from the ground up. This is the goal of the emerging field of causal representation learning (CRL) that uses causality as a vector for building flexible, interpretable, and transferable generative AI. CRL can be seen as a synthesis of three intrinsically statistical ideas: (i) latent variable models such as factor analysis; (ii) causal graphical models with latent variables; and (iii) nonparametric statistics and deep learning. This paper introduces CRL from a statistical perspective, focusing on connections to classical models as well as statistical and causal identifiability results. We also highlights key application areas, implementation strategies, and open statistical questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotong Ye, Nicolas Bougie, Toshihiko Yamasaki, Narimasa Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moulik Choraria, Xinbo Wu, Akhil Bhimaraju, Nitesh Sekhar, Yue Wu, Xu Zhang, Prateek Singhal, Lav R. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperscaling of data and parameter count in LLMs is yielding diminishing improvement when weighed against training costs, underlining a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference without sacrificing performance. This is especially so for multimodal language models (MLMs), where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens can limit their practical viability. Parallely, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large MLMs, deepening our understanding of how MLMs process and encode information. Motivated by this, and our observation that MLMs naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper layers of the model, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities, (i) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, (ii) LTU for audio, and (iii) MoLCA for molecular data, and model sizes, starting from 350M to 13B parameters, indicate that our method reduces both training and inference costs, while at least preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Song, Morgan Borjigin-Wang, Irene Madejski, Robert L. Grossman</p>
<p>Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference dataset in cancer through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and imaging data. Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-tse Huang, Kaiser Sun, Wenxuan Wang, Mark Dredze</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, whether they can sustain persistent latent states remains under-explored. The capacity to maintain and manipulate unexpressed, internal representations-analogous to human working memory-is a cornerstone of complex reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the "Latent State Persistence" (LSP) gap through three novel experiments. First, we utilize a Number Guessing Game, demonstrating that across independent queries, LLMs fail to allocate probability mass to a singular hidden choice, violating a fundamental probabilistic principle. Second, we employ a Yes-No Game to show that as the number of questions increases, LLMs suffer from "concept drift," leading to inevitable self-contradictions due to the lack of LSP. Finally, inspired by Mathematical Mentalism, we task models with tracking transformations on hidden variables, revealing a failure in variable binding and state evolution when the initial state is not explicitly present in the context. Collectively, these findings suggest that LLMs function as reactive post-hoc solvers rather than proactive planners with LSP. Our work provides a framework for evaluating the fidelity of internal representations and highlights a fundamental architectural divergence between autoregressive transformers and human-like cognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet Anh Khoa Tran, Emre Neftci, Willem A. M. Wybo</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaichao Jiang, He Wang, Xiaoshuai Hao, Xiulong Yang, Ajian Liu, Qi Chu, Yunfeng Diao, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Joint Energy-based Models (JEMs) are well known for their ability to unify classification and generation within a single framework. Despite their promising generative and discriminative performance, their robustness remains far inferior to adversarial training (AT), which, conversely, achieves strong robustness but sacrifices clean accuracy and lacks generative ability. This inherent trilemma-balancing classification accuracy, robustness, and generative capability-raises a fundamental question: Can a single model achieve all three simultaneously? To answer this, we conduct a systematic energy landscape analysis of clean, adversarial, and generated samples across various JEM and AT variants. We observe that AT reduces the energy gap between clean and adversarial samples, while JEMs narrow the gap between clean and synthetic ones. This observation suggests a key insight: if the energy distributions of all three data types can be aligned, we might bridge their performance disparities. Building on this idea, we propose Energy-based Joint Distribution Adversarial Training (EB-JDAT), a unified generative-discriminative-robust framework that maximizes the joint probability of clean and adversarial distribution. EB-JDAT introduces a novel min-max energy optimization to explicitly aligning energies across clean, adversarial, and generated samples. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that EB-JDAT achieves state-of-the-art robustness while maintaining near-original accuracy and generation quality of JEMs, effectively resolving the triple trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoning Yu, Ye Yu, Peiyan Zhang, Kai Wei, Haojing Luo, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghun Baek, Kazuki Egashira, Shota Onohara, Atsuyuki Miyai, Yuki Imajuku, Hikaru Ikuta, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526 high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the richly narrative domain of manga.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkai Fang, Shunyu Liu, Yang Zhou, Kongcheng Zhang, Tongya Zheng, Kaixuan Chen, Mingli Song, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing works inevitably rely on high-quality instructions and verifiable rewards for effective training, both of which are often difficult to obtain in specialized domains. In this paper, we propose Self-play Reinforcement Learning (SeRL) to bootstrap LLM training with limited initial data. Specifically, SeRL comprises two complementary modules: self-instruction and self-rewarding. The former module generates additional instructions based on the available data at each training step, employing robust online filtering strategies to ensure instruction quality, diversity, and difficulty. The latter module introduces a simple yet effective majority-voting mechanism to estimate response rewards for additional instructions, eliminating the need for external annotations. Finally, SeRL performs conventional RL based on the generated data, facilitating iterative self-play learning. Extensive experiments on various reasoning benchmarks and across different LLM backbones demonstrate that the proposed SeRL yields results superior to its counterparts and achieves performance on par with those obtained by high-quality data with verifiable rewards.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Mingfeng Li, Yunlong Song, Xingzhou Zhang, Linran Lu, Zhifei Zheng, Min Liu, Qi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To prevent the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) for malicious purposes, numerous efforts have been made to develop the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. However, as multiple LLMs become readily accessible through various Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms, attackers can strategically exploit LLMs' heterogeneous safety policies to fulfill malicious information generation tasks in a distributed manner. In this study, we introduce \textit{\textbf{PoisonSwarm}} to how attackers can reliably launder malicious tasks via the speculative use of LLM crowdsourcing. Building upon a scheduler orchestrating crowdsourced LLMs, PoisonSwarm maps the given malicious task to a benign analogue to derive a content template, decomposes it into semantic units for crowdsourced unit-wise rewriting, and reassembles the outputs into malicious content. Experiments show its superiority over existing methods in data quality, diversity, and success rates. Regulation simulations further reveal the difficulty of governing such distributed, orchestrated misuse in MaaS ecosystems, highlighting the need for coordinated, ecosystem-level defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Huang, Dan Luo, Zihe Ye, Weixin Chen, Minghao Guo, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Social recommender systems facilitate social connections by identifying potential friends for users. Each user maintains a local social network centered around themselves, resulting in a naturally distributed social structure. Recent research on distributed modeling for social recommender systems has gained increasing attention, as it naturally aligns with the user-centric structure of user interactions. Current distributed social recommender systems rely on automatically combining predictions from multiple models, often overlooking the user's active role in validating whether suggested connections are appropriate. Moreover, recommendation decisions are validated by individual users rather than derived from a single global ordering of candidates. As a result, standard ranking-based evaluation metrics make it difficult to evaluate whether a user-confirmed recommendation decision is actually correct. To address these limitations, we propose DeSocial, a distributed social recommendation framework with user-validation. DeSocial enables users to select recommendation algorithms to validate their potential connections, and the verification is processed through majority consensus among multiple independent user validators. To evaluate the distributed recommender system with user validator, we formulate this setting as a link prediction and verification task and introduce Acc@K, a consensus-based evaluation metric that measures whether user-approved recommendations are correct. Experiments on 4 real-world social networks shows that DeSocial improves decision correctness and robustness compared to single-point and distributed baselines. These findings highlight the potential of user-validated distributed recommender systems as a practical approach to social recommendation, with broader applicability to distributed and decentralized recommendations.

This work presents a novel equivariant solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process. Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input pieces are non-overlapped.</p>

<p>Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.</p>

We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and demonstrate that incorporating multi-agent debate during the planning stage increases the proof success rate by 20% overall and nearly doubles it for complex theorems, while the reflection mechanism further enhances stability and consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often suffers from long and noisy retrieved contexts. Prior context compression methods rely on predefined importance metrics or supervised compression models, rather than on the model's own inference-time behavior. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression framework that treats context compression as an understanding decoding problem. Sentinel probes native attention behaviors of a frozen LLM with a lightweight readout to decode which parts of the context are actually utilized when answering a query, rather than using attention as a direct relevance score. We empirically observe that decoded relevance signals exhibit sufficient consistency across model scales to support effective compression with compact proxy models. On LongBench, Sentinel with a 0.5B proxy model achieves up to 5x compression while matching the QA performance of 7B-scale baselines, and despite being trained only on English QA data, generalizes effectively to Chinese and out-of-domain settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy with dynamic entropy regulation, progressively teaching the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 23.6% over strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zenghao Guan, Guojun Zhu, Yucan Zhou, Wu Liu, Weiping Wang, Jiebo Luo, Xiaoyan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zoher Kachwala, Danishjeet Singh, Danielle Yang, Filippo Menczer</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional supervised methods for detecting AI-generated images depend on large, curated datasets for training and fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that prefilling responses effectively guides their reasoning -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%. We analyze this improvement in detection by tracking answer confidence during response generation. For some models, prefills counteract early overconfidence -- akin to mitigating the Dunning-Kruger effect -- leading to better detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hagai Hamami, Yosef Solewicz, Daniel Zur, Yonatan Kleerekoper, Joachim A. Behar</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Elder, Anupama Murthi, Jungkoo Kang, Ankita Rajaram Naik, Kiran Kate, Kinjal Basu, Danish Contractor</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools and APIs to execute complex tasks specified in natural language. Evaluating such tool calling capabilities in realistic enterprise settings is challenging: APIs are often proprietary, heterogeneous, and difficult to share, limiting reproducible benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Live API Bench, a comprehensive benchmark constructed by transforming NL2SQL datasets into interactive API environments. Our pipeline converts SQL queries from BIRD SQL into executable API sequences across three formulations SLOT, SEL, and REST covering minimal general purpose operations, domain specific multi step tasks, and function oriented RESTful interactions, respectively. The benchmark spans 11 databases with over 2,500 invocable tools, paired with human authored queries, ground truth API sequences, and verified final answers. Live API Bench enables systematic evaluation of core challenges in tool use, including error handling, sequential reasoning, parameter generation, response parsing, and robustness across diverse domains. We evaluate 10 LLMs and 4 ReACT agents, observing low task completion rates (7 to 47pct), which improve modestly to 50pct under interactive agent settings, highlighting substantial scope for improving LLM tool calling performance. We release all code and data associated with this paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Fan, Haodi Xu, Feng Tao, Md Nasim, Marc Grimson, Yiqi Luo, Carla P. Gomes</p>
<p>Abstract: Soils have potential to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, but the soil carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Scientists have developed process-based models of the soil carbon cycle based on existing knowledge, but they contain numerous unknown parameters and often fit observations poorly. On the other hand, neural networks can learn patterns from data, but do not respect known scientific laws, and are too opaque to reveal novel scientific relationships. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. While the process-based decoder enforces existing scientific knowledge, the encoder leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to reveal interpretable relationships between input features and latent parameters, using novel smoothness penalties to balance expressivity and simplicity. ScIReN also introduces a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters into prior ranges while maintaining interpretability. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. On both tasks, ScIReN outperforms or matches black-box models in predictive accuracy, while greatly improving scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglong Wang, Yang Gan, Yifu Huo, Yongyu Mu, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Chunliang Zhang, Tongran Liu, Jingbo Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In aligning large language models (LLMs), reward models have played an important role, but are standardly trained as discriminative models and rely only on labeled human preference data. In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingcong Li, Xiangyu Chang, Muti Kara, Xiaofeng Liu, Amit Roy-Chowdhury, Samet Oymak</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Dembinsky, Adriano Lucieri, Stanislav Frolov, Hiba Najjar, Ko Watanabe, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection, promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for future extensions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530 PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy. Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B, Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated images, its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional image data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the image generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and condition-aware low-rank adaptation (CALA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while CALA enables efficient adaptation to diverse rate requirements and channel conditions. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the consistency between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44% and enahnces the average transmission quality in terms of PSNR by 6.5 dB over the baselines without knowledge alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Zhao, Zefan Cai, Shuzheng Si, Liang Chen, Jiuxiang Gu, Wen Xiao, Minjia Zhang, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

<p>Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a premise entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to a given hypothesis. The task is often framed as emulating human inferential processes, in which commonsense knowledge plays a major role. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate useful commonsense axioms for Natural Language Inference, and evaluates their impact on performance using the SNLI and ANLI benchmarks with the Llama-3.1-70B and gpt-oss-120b models. We show that a hybrid approach, which selectively provides highly factual axioms based on judged helpfulness, yields consistent accuracy improvements of 1.99% to 6.88% across tested configurations, demonstrating the effectiveness of selective knowledge access for NLI. We also find that this targeted use of commonsense knowledge helps models overcome a bias toward the Neutral class by providing essential real-world context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Namvarpour (Matt), Brandon Brofsky, Jessica Medina, Mamtaj Akter, Afsaneh Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: AI companion chatbots are increasingly popular with teens. While these interactions are entertaining, they also risk overuse that can potentially disrupt offline daily life. We examined how adolescents describe reliance on AI companions, mapping their experiences onto behavioral addiction frameworks and exploring pathways to disengagement, by analyzing 318 Reddit posts made by users who self-disclosed as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI subreddit. We found teens often begin using chatbots for support or creative play, but these activities can deepen into strong attachments marked by conflict, withdrawal, tolerance, relapse, and mood regulation. Reported consequences include sleep loss, academic decline, and strained real-world connections. Disengagement commonly arises when teens recognize harm, re-engage with offline life, or encounter restrictive platform changes. We highlight specific risks of character-based companion chatbots based on teens' perspectives and introduce a design framework (CARE) for guidance for safer systems and setting directions for future teen-centered research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive language models achieve remarkable performance, yet a unified theory explaining their internal mechanisms, how training shapes their representations, and enables complex behaviors, remains elusive. We introduce a new analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a composition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov categories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical language to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are typically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the learned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our framework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of multi-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the information surplus a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the immediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the data's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using categorical entropy. Our central result shows that, under a linear-softmax head with bounded features, minimizing NLL induces spectral alignment: the learned representation space aligns with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator. This work presents a powerful new lens for understanding how information flows through a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxiong Chen, Shashwat Suri, Yuhao Wu, Yixian Cheng, Ganidhu Abeysirigoonawardena, Etienne Vouga, David I. W. Levin, Dinesh K. Pai</p>
<p>Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing, padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework, called SpringTime, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations. Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy, and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Smart contracts are important for digital finance, yet they are hard to patch once deployed. Prior work mostly studies LLMs for vulnerability detection, leaving their automated exploit generation (AEG) capability unclear. This paper closes that gap with \textsc{ReX}, a framework that links LLM-based exploit synthesis to the Foundry stack for end-to-end generation, compilation, execution, and verification. Five recent LLMs are evaluated across eight common vulnerability classes, supported by a curated dataset of 38{+} real incident PoCs and three automation aids: prompt refactoring, a compiler feedback loop, and templated test harnesses. Results indicate strong performance on single-contract PoCs and weak performance on cross-contract attacks; outcomes depend mainly on the model and bug type, with code structure and prompt tuning contributing little. The study also surfaces gaps in current defenses against LLM-driven AEG, pointing to the need for stronger protections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louie Hong Yao, Nicholas Jarvis, Tianyu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs. grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation, which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities, resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu dataset shows that each image maps to around four sense clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgments, offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Wang, Ziqi Huang, Ruoxi Jia, Paul Debevec, Ning Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Li, Yonghu He, Zirong Yu, Kun Gao, Qing Liu, Yali Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is essential for patient management in critical care and perioperative settings, providing continuous assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics with minimal risks. Numerous deep learning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively acquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model performance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and 31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time, unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing baseline for future advancements in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahajpreet Singh, Kokil Jaidka, Subhayan Mukerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Online hate remains a significant societal challenge, especially as multimodal content enables subtle, culturally grounded, and implicit forms of harm. Hateful memes embed hostility through text-image interactions and humor, making them difficult for automated systems to interpret. Although recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on explicit cases, their deployment is limited by high inference costs and persistent failures on nuanced content. This work examines how far small models can be improved through prompt optimization, fine-tuning, and automated data augmentation. We introduce an end-to-end pipeline that varies prompt structure, label granularity, and training modality, showing that structured prompts and scaled supervision significantly strengthen compact VLMs. We also develop a multimodal augmentation framework that generates counterfactually neutral memes via a coordinated LLM-VLM setup, reducing spurious correlations and improving the detection of implicit hate. Ablation studies quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that prompt design, granular labels, and targeted augmentation collectively narrow the gap between small and large models. The results offer a practical path toward more robust and deployable multimodal hate-detection systems without relying on costly large-model inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Niu, Jaemin Cho, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench, a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotated images. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikant Panda, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Shahad Al-Khalifa, Amit Agarwal, Hend Al-Khalifa, Sharefah Al-Ghamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent evaluations of Large language models (LLMs) audit social bias primarily through prompts that explicitly reference demographic attributes, overlooking whether models infer sensitive demographics from neutral questions. Such inference constitutes epistemic overreach and raises concerns for privacy. We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a diagnostic audit framework for evaluating demographic inference under epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate 18 open- and closed-source LLMs across six real-world domains and five demographic attributes. We find that many models infer demographics from neutral questions, defaulting to socially dominant categories and producing stereotype-aligned rationales. These behaviors persist across model families, scales and decoding settings, indicating reliance on learned population priors. We further show that inferred demographics can condition downstream responses and that abstention oriented prompting substantially reduces unintended inference without model fine-tuning. Our results suggest that current bias evaluations are incomplete and motivate evaluation standards that assess not only how models respond to demographic information, but whether they should infer it at all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Wei, Duoxiang Zhao, Zezhou Zhang, Yuqi Ouyang, Hao Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path planning strategies. Most recent navigation models focus on deterministic or time-dependent networks, overlooking correlations and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the reliable shortest path problem in stochastic transportation networks and propose a path planning solution integrating the decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to model long-term dependencies, our solution improves path decision accuracy and stability. Experiments on the Sioux Falls (SFN) and large Anaheim (AN) networks show consistent improvement in on-time arrival probabilities by capturing non-Markovian dependencies in historical routing decisions on real-world topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Balordi, Lorenzo Manini, Fabio Stella, Alessio Merlo</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushan Mitra, Dan Zhang, Hannah Kim, Estevam Hruschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines, in terms of plan preference. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable component for improving agentic planning in open-domain dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Tao, Yinuo Wang, Jinzhao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for motion control trains policies directly from sensor inputs to motor commands, enabling unified controllers for different robots and tasks. However, most existing methods are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context. We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations (e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for resource-constrained robotic and autonomous systems in engineering informatics applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine, with many studies adapting them through continued pre-training or fine-tuning on medical data to enhance domain-specific accuracy and safety. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. Memorization can be beneficial when it enables LLMs to retain valuable medical knowledge during domain adaptation. Yet, it also raises concerns. LLMs may inadvertently reproduce sensitive clinical content (e.g., patient-specific details), and excessive memorization may reduce model generalizability, increasing risks of misdiagnosis and making unwarranted recommendations. These risks are further amplified by the generative nature of LLMs, which can not only surface memorized content but also produce overconfident, misleading outputs that may hinder clinical adoption. In this work, we present a study on memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than that reported in the general domain. Moreover, memorization has distinct characteristics during continued pre-training and fine-tuning, and it is persistent: up to 87% of content memorized during continued pre-training remains after fine-tuning on new medical tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414">Is In-Context Learning Learning?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian de Wynter</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Jingshu Peng, Yanyan Shen, Xujia Li, Quanqing Xu, Chuanhui Yang, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which leverage price series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance. Traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we incorporate a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a listwise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitability evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Wiesner, Matthias Wessling, Stephen Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative - democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by more than 7x, (2) plausible zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) more stable long-term predictions through long-horizon rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.</p>

Models differed substantially in their tendency to resist the shutdown mechanism, and their behavior was sensitive to variations in the prompt including the strength and clarity of the instruction to allow shutdown and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user prompt (surprisingly, models were consistently less likely to obey the instruction when it was placed in the system prompt). Even with an explicit instruction not to interfere with the shutdown mechanism, some models did so up to 97% (95% CI: 96-98%) of the time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobin Sarwar, Shubhashis Roy Dipta</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning (FL) without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per-round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Du, Zitao Li, Ninghui Li, Bolin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Narayanan Moothedath, Umang Agarwal, Umeshraja N, James Richard Gross, Jaya Prakash Champati, Sharayu Moharir</p>
<p>Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference. Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between classification accuracy and the offloading costs within such a hierarchical inference (HI) system. To optimise this system, we propose an online learning framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and learns during the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to mismatched classifiers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Journaling can potentially serve as an effective method for autistic adolescents to improve narrative skills. However, its text-centric nature and high executive functioning demands present barriers to practice. We present Autiverse, an AI-guided multimodal journaling app for tablets that scaffolds daily narratives through conversational prompts and visual supports. Autiverse elicits key details of an adolescent-selected event through a stepwise dialogue with peer-like, customizable AI and composes them into an editable four-panel comic strip. Through a two-week deployment study with 10 autistic adolescent-parent dyads, we examine how Autiverse supports autistic adolescents to organize their daily experience and emotion. Our findings show Autiverse scaffolded adolescents' coherent narratives, while enabling parents to learn additional details of their child's events and emotions. Moreover, the customized AI peer created a comfortable space for sharing, fostering enjoyment and a strong sense of agency. Drawing on these results, we discuss implications for adaptive scaffolding across autism profiles, socio-emotionally appropriate AI peer design, and balancing autonomy with parental involvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxun Wang, Xingjun Zhang, Qianyang Li, Jiawei Cao, Zhendong Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate multivariate time series forecasting hinges on inter-series correlations, which often evolve in complex ways across different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Code is available at https://github.com/shaoxun6033/SDGFNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Axel Marmoret, Reda Bensaid, Jonathan Lys, Vincent Gripon, Fran\c{c}ois Leduc-Primeau</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Lee, Sean Foley, Thanathai Lertpetchpun, Kevin Huang, Yoonjeong Lee, Tiantian Feng, Louis Goldstein, Dani Byrd, Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable, computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI creates and exacerbates privacy risks, yet practitioners lack effective resources to identify and mitigate these risks. We present Privy, a tool that guides practitioners without privacy expertise through structured privacy impact assessments to: (i) identify relevant risks in novel AI product concepts, and (ii) propose appropriate mitigations. Privy was shaped by a formative study with 11 practitioners, which informed two versions -- one LLM-powered, the other template-based. We evaluated these two versions of Privy through a between-subjects, controlled study with 24 separate practitioners, whose assessments were reviewed by 13 independent privacy experts. Results show that Privy helps practitioners produce privacy assessments that experts deemed high quality: practitioners identified relevant risks and proposed appropriate mitigation strategies. These effects were augmented in the LLM-powered version. Practitioners themselves rated Privy as being useful and usable, and their feedback illustrates how it helps overcome long-standing awareness, motivation, and ability barriers in privacy work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Yazdan Parast, Parsa Hosseini, Hesam Asadollahzadeh, Arshia Soltani Moakhar, Basim Azam, Soheil Feizi, Naveed Akhtar</p>
<p>Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Li, Zhebo Wang, Tianliang Lu, Mohan Li, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches, such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Li, Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wengao Ye, Yan Liang, Lianlei Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning, where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text. However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Guo, Haochen Liu, Xiaojun Wu, Chen Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utku Boran Torun, Mehmet Taha Demircan, Mahmut Furkan G\"on, Eray T\"uz\"un</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional bug-tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting, reproduction, classification, and resolution, involving multiple stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This division of responsibilities requires substantial coordination and human effort, widens the communication gap between non-technical users and developers, and significantly slows the process from bug discovery to deployment. Moreover, current solutions are highly asynchronous, often leaving users waiting long periods before receiving any feedback. In this paper, we examine the evolution of bug-tracking practices, from early paper-based methods to today's web-based platforms, and present a forward-looking vision of an AI-powered bug tracking framework. The framework augments existing systems with large language model (LLM) and agent-driven automation, and we report early adaptations of its key components, providing initial empirical grounding for its feasibility. The proposed framework aims to reduce time to resolution and coordination overhead by enabling end users to report bugs in natural language while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, classify bugs, validate reports, suggest no-code fixes, generate patches, and support continuous integration and deployment. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating LLMs into bug tracking and show how intelligent automation can transform software maintenance into a more efficient, collaborative, and user-centric process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhui Yang, Yiming Jin, Pengkun Jiao, Chenhe Dong, Zerui Huang, Shaowei Yao, Xiaojiang Zhou, Dan Ou, Haihong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Bu, Haofeng Zhong, Wenzheng Chen, Yangyan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Zheng, Yaming Yang, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao, Xinyan Huang, Weigang Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The ``pre-train, prompt" paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<p>Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks, such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference, enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final report. To address this, we introduce DeepResearchGuard, a framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain evaluation, and DRSafeBench, a novel stage-wise safety benchmark. Evaluating across GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-flash, DeepSeek-v3, GPT-5, DeepResearchGuard improves defense success rates by 16.53% while reducing over-refusal to 6%. Through extensive experiments, we show that DRSafeBench enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shasha Guo, Liang Pang, Xi Wang, Yanling Wang, Huawei Shen, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Recent attempts construct auxiliary lines via code-driven rendering, a strategy that relies on accurate and executable code generation to produce visual renderings of the auxiliary lines for subsequent reasoning. However, in complex solid geometry settings, such a strong dependence on precise specifications substantially restricts the robustness of this strategy. Alternatively, we turn to a simpler and more stable solution, representing auxiliary-line constructions as structured textual descriptions. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances diagram-text alignment. The core is a cross-modal reward model that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description matches the ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. The reward signal drives a GRPO-based RL stage to yield informative auxiliary-line descriptions for the reasoning. To support the training and evaluation, we develop a scalable data pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of 3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual fields. Based on this framework, we derive GeoVLMath, an LVLM for solving complex solid geometry.</p>

<p>Abstract: Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process: domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same student model under ``standard'' and ``reasoning-augmented'' inputs as a teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness and practical value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Qiao, Xing Liu, Wenke Huang, Jianbin Li, Zhaoxin Fan, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Kate, Yara Rizk, Poulami Ghosh, Ashu Gulati, Tathagata Chakraborti, Zidane Wright, Mayank Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs) to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion. The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON) responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-An Chao, Bi-Cheng Yan, Berlin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hans Hergen Lehmann, Jae Hee Lee, Steven Schockaert, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaocong Ma, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices. However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets, enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes, offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si-Yu Xiao, Xin-Di Zhao, Tian-Hao Mao, Yi-Wei Wang, Yu-Qiao Chen, Hong-Yun Zhang, Jian Wang, Jun-Jie Wang, Shuang Liu, Tu-Pei Chen, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network has achieved significant progress in collar recognition, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into a downhole toolstring for CCL log acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. Comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation are proposed, and their effectiveness is evaluated using baseline neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across diverse configurations, the contribution of each augmentation method is analyzed. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing, and random cropping are fundamental prerequisites for model training, while label smoothing regularization, time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capabilities. Incorporating the proposed augmentation methods into the two baseline models results in maximum F1 score improvements of 0.027 and 0.024 for the TAN and MAN models, respectively. Furthermore, applying these techniques yields F1 score gains of up to 0.045 for the TAN model and 0.057 for the MAN model compared to prior studies. Performance evaluation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the existing gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models under CCL data-limited conditions, and provides a technical foundation for the future automation of downhole operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Cao, Yu Wang, Sitong Liu, Miao Li, Yixin Tao, Tianxing He</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) induces a critical vulnerability: the potential for dishonest manipulation by service providers. This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-\epsilon}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Norris, Kobi Gal, Sahan Bulathwela</p>
<p>Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao He, Courtney Miller, Shyam Agarwal, Christian K\"astner, Bogdan Vasilescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in software development, with practitioners reporting a multifold increase in productivity after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a statistically significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a substantial and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized-method-of-moments estimation reveals that increases in static analysis warnings and code complexity are major factors driving long-term velocity slowdown. Our study identifies quality assurance as a major bottleneck for early Cursor adopters and calls for it to be a first-class citizen in the design of agentic AI coding tools and AI-driven workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onkar Shelar, Travis Desell</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts that elicit toxic content even after safety alignment. We present ToxSearch, a black-box evolutionary framework that tests model safety by evolving prompts in a synchronous steady-state loop. The system employs a diverse set of operators, including lexical substitutions, negation, back-translation, paraphrasing, and two semantic crossover operators, while a moderation oracle provides fitness guidance. Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity. These results suggest that small, controllable perturbations are effective vehicles for systematic red-teaming and that defenses should anticipate cross-model reuse of adversarial prompts rather than focusing only on single-model hardening.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce MERA Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (imageto-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Mu, Guihai Chen, Xun Yang, Erkun Yang, Cheng Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebeka Toth, Tamas Bisztray, Richard Dubniczky</p>
<p>Abstract: Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wang, Changfeng Gao, Yang Xiang, Zhihao Du, Keyu An, Han Zhao, Qian Chen, Xiangang Li, Yingming Gao, Ya Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipeng Zhuang, Shiyu Fan, Florent P. Audonnet, Yingdong Ru, Edmond S. L. Ho, Gerardo Aragon Camarasa, Paul Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Yang, Alejandro Velasco, Thanh Le-Cong, Md Nazmul Haque, Bowen Xu, Denys Poshyvanyk</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.
  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mia Mohammad Imran, Tarannum Shaila Zaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in empirical software engineering (ESE) to automate or assist annotation tasks such as labeling commits, issues, and qualitative artifacts. Yet the reliability and reproducibility of such annotations remain underexplored. Existing studies often lack standardized measures for reliability, calibration, and drift, and frequently omit essential configuration details. We argue that LLM-based annotation should be treated as a measurement process rather than a purely automated activity. In this position paper, we outline the \textbf{Operationalization for LLM-based Annotation Framework (OLAF)}, a conceptual framework that organizes key constructs: \textit{reliability, calibration, drift, consensus, aggregation}, and \textit{transparency}. The paper aims to motivate methodological discussion and future empirical work toward more transparent and reproducible LLM-based annotation in software engineering research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Chen, Xiaopeng Li, Ziniu Li, Wotao Yin, Xi Chen, Tianyi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishu Yin, Xuehai Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: SSD-offloaded training offers a practical and promising approach to making LLM training cost-effective. Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh V. T. Thai, Tue Le, Dung Nguyen Manh, Huy Phan Nhat, Nghi D. Q. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, SWE-EVO comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on SWE-EVO, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian H\"agg, Kathl\'en Kohn, Giovanni Luca Marchetti, Boris Shapiro</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Sprecher Networks (SNs), a family of trainable architectures derived from David Sprecher's 1965 constructive form of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation. Each SN block implements a "sum of shifted univariate functions" using only two shared learnable splines per block, a monotone inner spline $\phi$ and a general outer spline $\Phi$, together with a learnable shift parameter $\eta$ and a mixing vector $\lambda$ shared across all output dimensions. Stacking these blocks yields deep, compositional models; for vector-valued outputs we append an additional non-summed output block.
  We also propose an optional lateral mixing operator enabling intra-block communication between output channels with only $O(d_{\mathrm{out}})$ additional parameters. Owing to the vector (not matrix) mixing weights and spline sharing, SNs scale linearly in width, approximately $O(\sum_{\ell}(d_{\ell-1}+d_{\ell}+G))$ parameters for $G$ spline knots, versus $O(\sum_{\ell} d_{\ell-1}d_{\ell})$ for dense MLPs and $O(G\sum_{\ell} d_{\ell-1}d_{\ell})$ for edge-spline KANs. This linear width-scaling is particularly attractive for extremely wide, shallow models, where low depth can translate into low inference latency. Finally, we describe a sequential forward implementation that avoids materializing the $d_{\mathrm{in}}\times d_{\mathrm{out}}$ shifted-input tensor, reducing peak forward-intermediate memory from quadratic to linear in layer width, relevant for memory-constrained settings such as on-device/edge inference; we demonstrate deployability via fixed-point real-time digit classification on resource-constrained embedded device with only 4 MB RAM. We provide empirical demonstrations on supervised regression, Fashion-MNIST classification (including stable training at 25 hidden layers with residual connections and normalization), and a Poisson PINN, with controlled comparisons to MLP and KAN baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent development of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) has found its application in the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) particularly in molecular data modeling and potential drug discovery. Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) expand on the existing set of GNN models with KAN-based counterparts. KAGNNs have been demonstrably successful in surpassing the accuracy of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)-based GNNs in the task of molecular property prediction. These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules. In this study, we explore the application of KAGNNs towards inorganic nanomaterials. In 2024, a large scale inorganic nanomaterials dataset was published under the title CHILI (Chemically-Informed Large-scale Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset), and various MLP-based GNNs have been tested on this dataset. We adapt and test our own KAGNNs appropriate for eight defined tasks. Our experiments reveal that, KAGNNs frequently surpass the performance of their counterpart GNNs. Most notably, on crystal system and space group classification tasks in CHILI-3K, KAGNNs achieve the new state-of-the-art results of 99.5 percent and 96.6 percent accuracy, respectively, compared to the previous 65.7 and 73.3 percent each.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Wang, Zhicheng Yang, Meng Cao, Mingfei Han, Haokun Lin, Yingying Zhu, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Group-relative reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often wastes the most informative data it already has the failures. When all rollouts are wrong, gradients stall; when one happens to be correct, the update usually ignores why the others are close-but-wrong, and credit can be misassigned to spurious chains. We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, CARE lifts macro-averaged accuracy by 4.6 points over GRPO across six verifiable visual-reasoning benchmarks; with Qwen3-VL-8B it reaches competitive or state-of-the-art results on MathVista and MMMU-Pro under an identical evaluation protocol.</p>

<p>Abstract: Locating files and functions requiring modification in large software repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing LLM-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which often overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool: jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a base pretrained model, without relying on closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as GPT-5 on most metrics. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joyjit Roy, Samaresh Kumar Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SB Danush Vikraman, Hannah Abigail, Prasanna Kesavraj, Gajanan V Honnavar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Momen, Emilie Sitter, Berenike Herrmann, Sina Zarrie{\ss}</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel metaphor comprehension involves complex semantic processes and linguistic creativity, making it an interesting task for studying language models (LMs). This study investigates whether surprisal, a probabilistic measure of predictability in LMs, correlates with annotations of metaphor novelty in different datasets. We analyse the surprisal of metaphoric words in corpus-based and synthetic metaphor datasets using 16 causal LM variants. We propose a cloze-style surprisal method that conditions on full-sentence context. Results show that LM surprisal yields significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (quality-power hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains limited as a metric of linguistic creativity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osasumwen Cedric Ogiesoba-Eguakun, Suman Rath</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Gong, Giovanni Pinna, Yixin Bian, Jie M. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pull request (PR) descriptions generated by AI coding agents are the primary channel for communicating code changes to human reviewers. However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that "descriptions claim unimplemented changes" was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5 times longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours). Our findings suggest that unreliable PR descriptions undermine trust in AI agents, highlighting the need for PR-MCI verification mechanisms and improved PR generation to enable trustworthy human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Narayanan Venkit, Yu Li, Yada Pruksachatkun, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic personas are widely used to condition large language models (LLMs) for social simulation, yet most personas are still constructed from coarse sociodemographic attributes or summaries. We revisit persona creation by introducing SCOPE, a socially grounded framework for persona construction and evaluation, built from a 141-item, two-hour sociopsychological protocol collected from 124 U.S.-based participants. Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bottleneck: demographics explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction and reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values and identity achieve strong alignment with substantially lower bias. These trends generalize to SimBench (441 aligned questions), where SCOPE personas outperform default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas, and SCOPE augmentation improves Nemotron-based personas. Our results indicate that persona quality depends on sociopsychological structure rather than demographic templates or summaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengran Mo, Zhan Su, Yuchen Hui, Jinghan Zhang, Jia Ao Sun, Zheyuan Liu, Chao Zhang, Tetsuya Sakai, Jian-Yun Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved superior performance in a range of downstream tasks, including LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouya Afshin, David Helminiak, Tianling Niu, Julie M. Jorns, Tina Yen, Bing Yu, Dong Hye Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oishee Bintey Hoque, Nibir Chandra Mandal, Kyle Luong, Amanda Wilson, Samarth Swarup, Madhav Marathe, Abhijin Adiga</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (i) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria; (ii) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier; and (iii) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show how specific infrastructure (e.g., barns, lagoons) shapes classification decisions. We release code, infrastructure masks, and descriptors to support transparent, scalable monitoring of livestock infrastructure, enabling risk modeling, change detection, and targeted regulatory action.

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\'anos Kram\'ar, Joshua Engels, Zheng Wang, Bilal Chughtai, Rohin Shah, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architectures that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant distribution shifts, including multi-turn conversations, long context prompts, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while our novel architectures address context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing works increasingly adopt memory-centric mechanisms to process long contexts in a segment manner, and effective memory management is one of the key capabilities that enables large language models to effectively propagate information across the entire sequence. Therefore, leveraging reward models (RMs) to automatically and reliably evaluate memory quality is critical. In this work, we introduce MemoryRewardBench, the first benchmark to systematically study the ability of RMs to evaluate long-term memory management processes. MemoryRewardBench covers both long-context comprehension and long-form generation tasks, featuring 10 distinct settings with different memory management patterns, with context length ranging from 8K to 128K tokens. Evaluations on 13 cutting-edge RMs indicate a diminishing performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, with newer-generation models consistently outperforming their predecessors regardless of parameter count. We further expose the capabilities and fundamental limitations of current RMs in evaluating LLM memory management across diverse settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseung Hwang, Seungeun Lee, Lucas Rosenblatt, Steven Euijong Whang, Julia Stoyanovich</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc explanations are widely used to justify, contest, and review automated decisions in high-stakes domains such as lending, employment, and healthcare. Among these methods, SHAP is often treated as providing a reliable account of which features mattered for an individual prediction and is routinely used to support recourse, oversight, and accountability. In practice, however, SHAP explanations can differ substantially across repeated runs, even when the individual, prediction task, and trained model are held fixed. We conceptualize and name this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: the existence of multiple, internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. Explanation multiplicity poses a normative challenge for responsible AI deployment, as it undermines expectations that explanations can reliably identify the reasons for an adverse outcome. We present a comprehensive methodology for characterizing explanation multiplicity in post-hoc feature attribution methods, disentangling sources arising from model training and selection versus stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. Furthermore, whether explanation multiplicity is surfaced depends on how explanation consistency is measured. Commonly used magnitude-based metrics can suggest stability while masking substantial instability in the identity and ordering of top-ranked features. To contextualize observed instability, we derive and estimate randomized baseline values under plausible null models, providing a principled reference point for interpreting explanation disagreement. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find that explanation multiplicity is widespread and persists even under highly controlled conditions, including high-confidence predictions. Thus explanation practices must be evaluated using metrics and baselines aligned with their intended societal role.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the quality of responses in Question-Answering (QA) tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with retrieving contextually relevant information, leading to incomplete or suboptimal answers. In this paper, we introduce Structured-Semantic RAG (SSRAG), a hybrid architecture that enhances QA quality by integrating query augmentation, agentic routing, and a structured retrieval mechanism combining vector and graph based techniques with context unification. By refining retrieval processes and improving contextual grounding, our approach improves both answer accuracy and informativeness. We conduct extensive evaluations on three popular QA datasets, TruthfulQA, SQuAD and WikiQA, across five Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that our proposed approach consistently improves response quality over standard RAG implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishir Garg, Neel Kolhe, Andy Peng, Rohan Gopalam</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge on sequential tasks. However, the key challenge in such settings is to learn new tasks without catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks. We propose the Fisher-Orthogonal Projected Natural Gradient Descent (FOPNG) optimizer, which enforces Fisher-orthogonal constraints on parameter updates to preserve old task performance while learning new tasks. Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. We provide theoretical analysis deriving the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100.

<p>Abstract: Tokenization underlies every large language model, yet it remains an under-theorized and inconsistently designed component. Common subword approaches such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) offer scalability but often misalign with linguistic structure, amplify bias, and waste capacity across languages and domains. This paper reframes tokenization as a core modeling decision rather than a preprocessing step. We argue for a context-aware framework that integrates tokenizer and model co-design, guided by linguistic, domain, and deployment considerations. Standardized evaluation and transparent reporting are essential to make tokenization choices accountable and comparable. Treating tokenization as a core design problem, not a technical afterthought, can yield language technologies that are fairer, more efficient, and more adaptable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Suppose we need a deep collective analysis of an open scientific problem: there is a complex scientific hypothesis and a large online group of mutually unrelated experts with relevant private information of a diverse and unpredictable nature. This information may be results of experts' individual experiments, original reasoning of some of them, results of AI systems they use, etc. We propose a simple mechanism based on a self-resolving play-money prediction market entangled with a chat. We show that such a system can easily be brought to an equilibrium where participants directly share their private information on the hypothesis through the chat and trade as if the market were resolved in accordance with the truth of the hypothesis. This approach will lead to efficient aggregation of relevant information in a completely interpretable form even if the ground truth cannot be established and experts initially know nothing about each other and cannot perform complex Bayesian calculations. Finally, by rewarding the experts with some real assets proportionally to the play money they end up with, we can get an innovative way to fund large-scale collaborative studies of any type.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Rossolini</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to identify model vulnerabilities; however, their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial example provides a representative estimate of misprediction risk under stochastic perturbations of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To address this question, we introduce a probabilistic analysis that quantifies this risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $\kappa$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial directions. Building on this, we study the limits of this connection by proposing an attack strategy designed to probe vulnerabilities in regimes that are statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark multiple attacks, revealing when adversarial success meaningfully reflects robustness to perturbations and when it does not, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented robustness evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Zhang, Shudong Yang, Jinlan Fu, See-Kiong Ng, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Yuan, Qingyun Sun, Jiacheng Tao, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zanlin Ni, Shenzhi Wang, Yang Yue, Tianyu Yu, Weilin Zhao, Yeguo Hua, Tianyi Chen, Jun Song, Cheng Yu, Bo Zheng, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) break the rigid left-to-right constraint of traditional LLMs, enabling token generation in arbitrary orders. Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation motivates a rethink of RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning can be better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanning Hu, Anchen Li, Qianli Xing, Jinglong Ji, Hao Tuo, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong representation and reasoning capabilities, but their application to structure-based drug design (SBDD) is limited by insufficient understanding of protein structures and unpredictable molecular generation. To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning DAG structures from purely observational data remains a long-standing challenge across scientific domains. An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate whether high-frequency key collisions are a primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory. To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.
  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent "hot-to-cold advantage flip" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.
  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Stratigi, Nikos Bikakis, Kostas Stefanidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Group recommender systems help users make collective choices but often lack transparency, leaving group members uncertain about why items are suggested. Existing explanation methods focus on individuals, offering limited support for groups where multiple preferences interact. In this paper, we propose a framework for group counterfactual explanations, which reveal how removing specific past interactions would change a group recommendation. We formalize this concept, introduce utility and fairness measures tailored to groups, and design heuristic algorithms, such as Pareto-based filtering and grow-and-prune strategies, for efficient explanation discovery. Experiments on MovieLens and Amazon datasets show clear trade-offs: low-cost methods produce larger, less fair explanations, while other approaches yield concise and balanced results at higher cost. Furthermore, the Pareto-filtering heuristic demonstrates significant efficiency improvements in sparse settings.</p>
