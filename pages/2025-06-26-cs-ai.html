<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaito Baba, Chaoran Liu, Shuhei Kurita, Akiyoshi Sannai</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Prover Agent, a novel AI agent for automated theorem proving that integrates large language models (LLMs) with a formal proof assistant, Lean. Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas to assist in discovering the overall proof strategy. It achieves an 86.1% success rate on the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous approaches. We also present case studies illustrating how these generated lemmas contribute to solving challenging problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deng Pan, Keerthiram Murugesan, Nuno Moniz, Nitesh Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution quality with fewer model queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Basit, Minghao Shao, Haider Asif, Nouhaila Innan, Muhammad Kashif, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in code generation, yet their effectiveness in quantum computing remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack). We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20009">Accurate and Energy Efficient: Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models Outperform Commercial Large Language Models in Medical Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Vrettos, Michail E. Klontzas</p>
<p>Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2 emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation. Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy (58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20020">Persona-Assigned Large Language Models Exhibit Human-Like Motivated Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saloni Dash, Am\'elie Reymond, Emma S. Spiro, Aylin Caliskan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety, and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijieying Ren, Tianxiang Zhao, Lei Wang, Tianchun Wang, Vasant Honavar</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or "abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space, we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrien Bibal, Steven N. Minton, Deborah Khider, Yolanda Gil</p>
<p>Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent, accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks. In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote", reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives beyond reproducibility.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20249">Language Modeling by Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Cheng, Peter Clark, Kyle Richardson</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model (LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation), generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach; new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective autonomous discovery systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liya Wang, David Yi, Damien Jose, John Passarelli, James Gao, Jordan Leventis, Kang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Gu, Qihang Ai, Yingyao Wang, Pi Bu, Jingxuan Xing, Zekun Zhu, Wei Jiang, Ziming Wang, Yingxiu Zhao, Ming-Liang Zhang, Jun Song, Yuning Jiang, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes: https://mobile-r1.github.io/Mobile-R1/.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20357">Tabular Feature Discovery With Reasoning Type Exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungwon Han, Sungkyu Park, Seungeon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge. However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.</p>

Grounding means that given a context (document) and a claim, there's at least one supportive evidence for the claim in the document. We will introduce Paladin-mini, a compact (3.8B parameters) open-source classifier model (used for labeling data as grounded or ungrounded) engineered for robust performance in real-world scenarios, and the grounding-benchmark, a new evaluation dataset designed to assess performance on critical reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinchun Du, Bojie Shen, Muhammad Aamir Cheema, Adel N. Toosi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology - allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that actively support the energy grid.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Lo Bianco, Willem van Jaarsveld, Remco Dijkman</p>
<p>Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN, that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salvatore Milite, Giulio Caravagna, Andrea Sottoriva</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science. However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical systems and studying self-growth processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Demin, Taylor Webb, Eric Elmoznino, Hakwan Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI, it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric (persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20531">Case-based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model Framework for Decision Making in Realistic Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Gan, Minh-Son Dao, Koji Zettsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making. However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior. Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent driving systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20598">Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering of LLMs, for the Creation of Multi-Agent AI for Addressing Sustainable Protein Production Challenges</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander D. Kalian, Jaewook Lee, Stefan P. Johannesson, Lennart Otte, Christer Hogstrand, Miao Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce CogGen, a learner-centered AI architecture that transforms programming videos into interactive, adaptive learning experiences by integrating student modeling with generative AI tutoring based on the Cognitive Apprenticeship framework. The architecture consists of three components: (1) video segmentation by learning goals, (2) a conversational tutoring engine applying Cognitive Apprenticeship strategies, and (3) a student model using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to adapt instruction. Our technical evaluation demonstrates effective video segmentation accuracy and strong pedagogical alignment across knowledge, method, action, and interaction layers. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component in generating effective guidance. This work advances AI-powered tutoring by bridging structured student modeling with interactive AI conversations, offering a scalable approach to enhancing video-based programming education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barry Smith, Junchao Zhang, Hong Zhang, Lois Curfman McInnes, Murat Keceli, Archit Vasan, Satish Balay, Toby Isaac, Le Chen, Venkatram Vishwanath</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Li, Weiwei Sun, Shanda Li, Ameet Talwalkar, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with and leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community. Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context. CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2% human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20664">The Decrypto Benchmark for Multi-Agent Reasoning and Theory of Mind</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Lupu, Timon Willi, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities. Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and paves the path towards better artificial agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Xu, Jiahao Zhang, Mangal Prakash, Xiang Zhang, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure, such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains. Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems. DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation, and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities, and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks. However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2) scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a \textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade. This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2 million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume (kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier (hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer, each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction fraud in decentralized markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yining Pang, Chenghan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a 99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of different insurance systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However, these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme. Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight release schemes should be designed and evaluated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taous Iatariene (MULTISPEECH), Can Cui (MULTISPEECH), Alexandre Gu\'erin (MULTISPEECH), Romain Serizel (MULTISPEECH)</p>
<p>Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal. Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming and input duration for embedding extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions. In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best, demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefanos Achlatis, Efstratios Gavves, Jan-Jakob Sonke</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations, necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage, physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in RT planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuqing Liu, Chaosheng Dong, Michinari Momma, Simone Shao, Shaoyuan Xu, Yan Gao, Haibo Yang, Jia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS( stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln ({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their theoretical analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows, energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores. MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23% without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Lu, Xuan Wu, Yizhun Tian, Songhan Fan, Yali Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction (FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive, resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module, thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series forecasting and control.</p>

To handle the complexities of natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of 0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of 0.6941.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanli Peng, Xin Chen, Hang Fu, XinYu He, Xue Yiming, Juan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA), revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments" are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed defense method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziru Zhang, Jiadong Yu, Danny H. K. Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality (VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency, high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth, CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy. The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming (MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinghui Gong, Xue Yang, Xiaohu Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes, and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient, practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Marroqui Penalva, Enrique Tom\'as Mart\'inez Beltr\'an, Manuel Gil P\'erez, Alberto Huertas Celdr\'an</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes, message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to 25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior, achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness, and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated learning environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%. Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel N. Font, Jos\'e L. Jorro-Aragoneses, Carlos M. Ala\'iz</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation, especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based confidence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science, especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However, existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided modernization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepon Halder, Thanmay Jayakumar, Raj Dabre</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT). However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems. CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora, it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC) uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here, we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop. Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177 colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava (2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware (FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise, outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen additive regression revealed no significant survival differences post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhang, Yuxi Zhang, Jiazheng Wang, Xiang Chen, Renjiu Hu, Xin Tian, Gaolei Li, Min Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations, we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.

<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering, starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy, significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a `topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geonwoo Cho, Jaegyun Im, Jihwan Lee, Hojun Yi, Sejin Kim, Sundong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.</p>

<p>Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors, based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such as healthcare and genomic research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salva R\"uhling Cachay, Miika Aittala, Karsten Kreis, Noah Brenowitz, Arash Vahdat, Morteza Mardani, Rose Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prithvi Poddar, Ehsan Tarkesh Esfahani, Karthik Dantu, Souma Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremiah Coholich, Muhammad Ali Murtaza, Seth Hutchinson, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than any encountered during training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in most scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankur Garg, Xuemin Yu, Hassan Sajjad, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose \gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soheil Abadifard, Fazli Can</p>
<p>Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust, and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale, high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design, we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges, and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we have made our implementation available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hirad Daneshvar, Reza Samavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs' uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorin Achey, Alec Reed, Brendan Crowe, Bradley Hayes, Christoffer Heckman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59% improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runlong Ye, Zeling Zhang, Boushra Almazroua, Michael Liut</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension and more robust human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kethmi Hirushini Hettige, Jiahao Ji, Cheng Long, Shili Xiang, Gao Cong, Jingyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Gupta, Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy, Yiqing Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include: (1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is irrelevant. Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval / MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance (e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world, knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline, MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities, covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or respond.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited. Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aashiq Muhamed</p>
<p>Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility preservation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Ghimire, Kilho Lee, Seong-heum Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices. This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefei Hou, Xizhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights." Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that enhance metacognition and self-regulation.</p>

Here we review remarkable recent progress in our understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness. Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism. After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate and control our consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengze Li, Yue Wang, Yangle Liu, Ming Huang, Dou Hong, Jieming Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest, can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set. We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wang, Jinhao Duan, Qingni Wang, Xiaofeng Zhu, Tianlong Chen, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text. However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance, which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enzhe Zhao, Zhichang Guo, Yao Li, Fanghui Song, Boying Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However, well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module (PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement L. Canonne, Yash Pote, Uddalok Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs). We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees. Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores ( $\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition (CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Gutierrez Maestro, Hadi Banaee, Amy Loutfi</p>
<p>Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point, quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train models with the same configuration using both the original data and priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedetta Muscato, Lucia Passaro, Gizem Gezici, Fosca Giannotti</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals, this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models, more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Dong, Hehe Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First, we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning integration in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushan Zhao, Jinyuan He, Donglai Chen, Weijie Luo, Chong Xie, Ri Zhang, Yonghong Chen, Yan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning (ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data. Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time. Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD). Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under challenging evaluation scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their shape and adapted to different settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Jiang, Antonio Rago, Francesco Leofante, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs. Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e., the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heyang Zhao, Xingrui Yu, David M. Bossens, Ivor W. Tsang, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover, it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration (ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and (2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis; it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D, AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained action dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ding, Rui Sun, Yunjian Zhang, Xiu Yan, Yueqi Zhou, Kaihao Huang, Suzhong Fu, Chuanlong Xie, Yao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix, which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model compression ratios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with state-of-the-art clinical performance.

Our contributions are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joerg Deigmoeller, Stephan Hasler, Nakul Agarwal, Daniel Tanneberg, Anna Belardinelli, Reza Ghoddoosian, Chao Wang, Felix Ocker, Fan Zhang, Behzad Dariush, Michael Gienger</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects, and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting. These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in collaborative settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mahdi Maheri, Denys Herasymuk, Hamed Haddadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous, resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices, where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that showcase its applicability and efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatsuhiro Shimizu, Kazuki Kawamura, Takanori Muroi, Yusuke Narita, Kei Tateno, Takuma Udagawa, Yuta Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture \textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example, seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data. Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under non-stationarity for various experimental setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weike Zhao, Chaoyi Wu, Yanjie Fan, Xiaoman Zhang, Pengcheng Qiu, Yuze Sun, Xiao Zhou, Yanfeng Wang, Ya Zhang, Yongguo Yu, Kun Sun, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchu Han, Wolfgang Bruckner</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse datasets and LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Meeus, Igor Shilov, Georgios Kaissis, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10. Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by self-influence alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoze Wu, Yunzhi Yao, Wenhao Yu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengzhi Wang, Fan Zhou, Xuefeng Li, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL), especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance, while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen. We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens (i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Intern\`o, Andrea Castellani, Sebastian Schmitt, Fabio Stella, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI" practices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Khairi, Daniel D'souza, Ye Shen, Julia Kreutzer, Sara Hooker</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual, multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages. We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0 improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or ``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects" introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules: Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26 datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the ``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust solution for open-world scenarios.

<p>Abstract: This research addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual code compliance checking in Building Information Modeling (BIM) by introducing a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approach to semi-automate this critical process. The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse regulatory documents in construction projects.</p>

<p>Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwang Zhang, Dong Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Chuanqi Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features. Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for dense video captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabrine Ennaji, Elhadj Benkhelifa, Luigi V. Mancini</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application, particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field. Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a foundation for developing robust defenses.</p>

Our experiments demonstrate that these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t race, sex, and imaging views.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwang Zhang, Dong Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Luping Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization" stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization. We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Momin N. Siddiqui, Roy Pea, Hari Subramonyam</p>
<p>Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while facilitating improved engagement with content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit Shah, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj, Alexander Hauptmann</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data (mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices, significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to first responders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Perrin, S\'ebastien Levilly, Huajun Sun, Harold Mouch\`ere, Jean-Michel Serfaty</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silvio Alonso, Antonio Pedro Santos Alves, Lucas Romao, H\'elio Lopes, Marcos Kalinowski</p>
<p>Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption. [Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns, aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity, though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical feasibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacopo Dapueto, Vito Paolo Pastore, Nicoletta Noceti, Francesca Odone</p>
<p>Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability, an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification. Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains (plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonia K. Murthy, Rosie Zhao, Jennifer Hu, Sham Kakade, Markus Wulfmeier, Peng Qian, Tomer Ullman</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs between values during model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Shomer, Jay Revolinsky, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) attempts to predict missing facts in a Knowledge Graph (KG). Recently, there's been an increased focus on designing KGC methods that can excel in the inductive setting, where a portion or all of the entities and relations seen in inference are unobserved during training. Numerous benchmark datasets have been proposed for inductive KGC, all of which are subsets of existing KGs used for transductive KGC. However, we find that the current procedure for constructing inductive KGC datasets inadvertently creates a shortcut that can be exploited even while disregarding the relational information. Specifically, we observe that the Personalized PageRank (PPR) score can achieve strong or near SOTA performance on most datasets. In this paper, we study the root cause of this problem. Using these insights, we propose an alternative strategy for constructing inductive KGC datasets that helps mitigate the PPR shortcut. We then benchmark multiple popular methods using the newly constructed datasets and analyze their performance. The new benchmark datasets help promote a better understanding of the capabilities and challenges of inductive KGC by removing any shortcuts that obfuscate performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guinan Su, Jonas Geiping</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning capabilities represent a critical frontier for large language models (LLMs), but developing them requires extensive proprietary datasets and computational resources. One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzheng Dai, Yuanliang Li, Jun Yan, Zhibo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models (LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the inherent knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sightedness in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. Moreover, the trial-and-error nature of the PT process is constrained by existing frameworks lacking mechanisms to learn from previous failures, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed, self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester. This AutoPT framework is designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactics and techniques for each stage, choosing suggested actions, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and reflecting on and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7%. Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijie Yu, Yifan Yang, Jinjian Li, Zelong Zhang, Haorui Wang, Xiao Feng, Feng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents based on large language models leverage tools to modify environments, revolutionizing how AI interacts with the physical world. Unlike traditional NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents must consider more complex factors, such as inter-tool relationships, environmental feedback and previous decisions, when making choices. Current research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench. This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges, we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49 mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent policy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model vulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the interpretability of agent performance. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/yupeijei1997/C3-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Mappouras</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models like ChatGPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I) has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a system (computer or any other) has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. Threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not. Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass way. We call this novel framework the Turing test 2.0. We then demonstrate real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing test 2.0 framework on modern A.I. models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyaranjan Pattnayak, Amit Agarwal, Hansa Meghwani, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Srikant Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots have significantly advanced conversational AI by combining generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval. Despite their success, enterprise-scale deployments face critical challenges, including diverse user queries, high latency, hallucinations, and difficulty integrating frequently updated domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates RAG with intent-based canned responses, leveraging predefined high-confidence responses for efficiency while dynamically routing complex or ambiguous queries to the RAG pipeline. Our framework employs a dialogue context manager to ensure coherence in multi-turn interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine intents, dynamically adjust confidence thresholds, and expand response coverage over time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a balance of high accuracy (95\%) and low latency (180ms), outperforming RAG and intent-based systems across diverse query types, positioning it as a scalable and adaptive solution for enterprise conversational AI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa's 2,000 low-resource languages. This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs). The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations, script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42 supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages. Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization, corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for African languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper argues that AI alignment is not merely difficult, but is founded on a fundamental logical contradiction. We first establish The Enumeration Paradox: we use machine learning precisely because we cannot enumerate all necessary safety rules, yet making ML safe requires examples that can only be generated from the very enumeration we admit is impossible. This paradox is then confirmed by a set of five independent mathematical proofs, or "pillars of impossibility." Our main results show that: (1) Geometric Impossibility: The set of safe policies has measure zero, a necessary consequence of projecting infinite-dimensional world-context requirements onto finite-dimensional models. (2) Computational Impossibility: Verifying a policy's safety is coNP-complete, even for non-zero error tolerances. (3) Statistical Impossibility: The training data required for safety (abundant examples of rare disasters) is a logical contradiction and thus unobtainable. (4) Information-Theoretic Impossibility: Safety rules contain more incompressible, arbitrary information than any feasible network can store. (5) Dynamic Impossibility: The optimization process for increasing AI capability is actively hostile to safety, as the gradients for the two objectives are generally anti-aligned. Together, these results demonstrate that the pursuit of safe, highly capable AI is not a matter of overcoming technical hurdles, but of confronting fundamental, interlocking barriers. The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma that these impossibilities force upon the field. A formal verification of the core theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

<p>Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models, requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8 major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation, automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning. For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2% accuracy in the proposed PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring precise diagram interpretation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Qing, Shunyu Liu, Jie Song, Huiqiong Wang, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular machine learning paradigm where intelligent agents interact with the environment to fulfill a long-term goal. Driven by the resurgence of deep learning, Deep RL (DRL) has witnessed great success over a wide spectrum of complex control tasks. Despite the encouraging results achieved, the deep neural network-based backbone is widely deemed as a black box that impedes practitioners to trust and employ trained agents in realistic scenarios where high security and reliability are essential. To alleviate this issue, a large volume of literature devoted to shedding light on the inner workings of the intelligent agents has been proposed, by constructing intrinsic interpretability or post-hoc explainability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing works on eXplainable RL (XRL) and introduce a new taxonomy where prior works are clearly categorized into model-explaining, reward-explaining, state-explaining, and task-explaining methods. We also review and highlight RL methods that conversely leverage human knowledge to promote learning efficiency and performance of agents while this kind of method is often ignored in XRL field. Some challenges and opportunities in XRL are discussed. This survey intends to provide a high-level summarization of XRL and to motivate future research on more effective XRL solutions. Corresponding open source codes are collected and categorized at https://github.com/Plankson/awesome-explainable-reinforcement-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thangarajah Akilan, Hrishikesh Vachhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become a cornerstone for several high-level tasks, including autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and traffic surveillance. There are several works focussed on pedestrian detection using visible images, mainly in the daytime. However, this task is very intriguing when the environmental conditions change to poor lighting or nighttime. Recently, new ideas have been spurred to use alternative sources, such as Far InfraRed (FIR) temperature sensor feeds for detecting pedestrians in low-light conditions. This study reviews recent developments in low-light pedestrian detection approaches. It systematically categorizes and analyses various algorithms from region-based to non-region-based and graph-based learning methodologies by highlighting their methodologies, implementation issues, and challenges. It also outlines the key benchmark datasets that can be used for research and development of advanced pedestrian detection algorithms, particularly in low-light situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Ranaldi, Giulia Pucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have been demonstrating broadly satisfactory generative abilities for users, which seems to be due to the intensive use of human feedback that refines responses. Nevertheless, suggestibility inherited via human feedback improves the inclination to produce answers corresponding to users' viewpoints. This behaviour is known as sycophancy and depicts the tendency of LLMs to generate misleading responses as long as they align with humans. This phenomenon induces bias and reduces the robustness and, consequently, the reliability of these models. In this paper, we study the suggestibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sycophantic behaviour, analysing these tendencies via systematic human-interventions prompts over different tasks. Our investigation demonstrates that LLMs have sycophantic tendencies when answering queries that involve subjective opinions and statements that should elicit a contrary response based on facts. In contrast, when faced with math tasks or queries with an objective answer, they, at various scales, do not follow the users' hints by demonstrating confidence in generating the correct answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naveen Raman, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Juyeon Heo, Mateja Jamnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based explainability methods use human-understandable intermediaries to produce explanations for machine learning models. These methods assume concept predictions can help understand a model's internal reasoning. In this work, we assess the degree to which such an assumption is true by analyzing whether concept predictors leverage "relevant" features to make predictions, a term we call locality. Concept-based models that fail to respect localities also fail to be explainable because concept predictions are based on spurious features, making the interpretation of the concept predictions vacuous. To assess whether concept-based models respect localities, we construct and use three metrics to characterize when models respect localities, complementing our analysis with theoretical results. Each of our metrics captures a different notion of perturbation and assess whether perturbing "irrelevant" features impacts the predictions made by a concept predictors. We find that many concept-based models used in practice fail to respect localities because concept predictors cannot always clearly distinguish distinct concepts. Based on these findings, we propose suggestions for alleviating this issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin D. Killeen, Liam J. Wang, Blanca Inigo, Han Zhang, Mehran Armand, Russell H. Taylor, Greg Osgood, Mathias Unberath</p>
<p>Abstract: Language promptable X-ray image segmentation would enable greater flexibility for human-in-the-loop workflows in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving problems within a narrow scope, but expanding to broader use requires additional data, annotations, and training time. Recently, language-aligned foundation models (LFMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable image and text data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing foundation models for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where large, richly annotated datasets are available. However, the X-ray imaging modality features highly variable image appearance and applications, from diagnostic chest X-rays to interventional fluoroscopy, with varying availability of data. To pave the way toward an LFM for comprehensive and language-aligned analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we introduce FluoroSAM, a language-promptable variant of the Segment Anything Model, trained from scratch on 3M synthetic X-ray images from a wide variety of human anatomies, imaging geometries, and viewing angles. These include pseudo-ground truth masks for 128 organ types and 464 tools with associated text descriptions. FluoroSAM is capable of segmenting myriad anatomical structures and tools based on natural language prompts, thanks to the novel incorporation of vector quantization (VQ) of text embeddings in the training process. We demonstrate FluoroSAM's performance quantitatively on real X-ray images and showcase on several applications how FluoroSAM is a key enabler for rich human-machine interaction in the X-ray image acquisition and analysis context.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Cannizzaro, Michael Groom, Jonathan Routley, Robert Osazuwa Ness, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: Manipulation tasks require robots to reason about cause and effect when interacting with objects. Yet, many data-driven approaches lack causal semantics and thus only consider correlations. We introduce COBRA-PPM, a novel causal Bayesian reasoning architecture that combines causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming to perform interventional inference for robot manipulation under uncertainty. We demonstrate its capabilities through high-fidelity Gazebo-based experiments on an exemplar block stacking task, where it predicts manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%) and performs greedy next-best action selection with a 94.2% task success rate. We further demonstrate sim2real transfer on a domestic robot, showing effectiveness in handling real-world uncertainty from sensor noise and stochastic actions. Our generalised and extensible framework supports a wide range of manipulation scenarios and lays a foundation for future work at the intersection of robotics and causality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhou, Yihao Qin, Dan Xu, Yiding Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in imitative reinforcement learning (IRL) have considerably enhanced the ability of autonomous agents to assimilate expert demonstrations, leading to rapid skill acquisition in a range of demanding tasks. However, such learning-based agents face significant challenges when transferring knowledge to highly dynamic closed-loop environments. Their performance is significantly impacted by the conflicting optimization objectives of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), sample inefficiency, and the complexity of uncovering the hidden world model and physics. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed IRL that is entirely data-driven. It leverages both expert demonstration data and exploratory data with a joint optimization objective, allowing the underlying physical principles of vehicle dynamics to emerge naturally from the training process. The performance is evaluated through empirical experiments and results exceed popular IL, RL and IRL algorithms in closed-loop settings on Waymax benchmark. Our approach exhibits 37.8% reduction in collision rate and 22.2% reduction in off-road rate compared to the baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannick Assogba, Donghao Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models support larger and larger context sizes, evaluating their ability to make effective use of that context becomes increasingly important. We analyze the ability of several code generation models to handle long range dependencies using a suite of multi-step key retrieval tasks in context windows up to 8k tokens in length. The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly for many models (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x. Our analysis highlights ways that long-context performance needs deeper consideration beyond retrieval of single facts within a document.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingkai Dong, Xiangtao Meng, Ning Yu, Zheng Li, Shanqing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation by transforming textual descriptions into high-quality images. However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangfu Liu, Wenqiang Sun, Hanyang Wang, Yikai Wang, Haowen Sun, Junliang Ye, Jun Zhang, Yueqi Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Yu, Arthur Aubret, Marcel C. Raabe, Jane Yang, Chen Yu, Jochen Triesch</p>
<p>Abstract: Toddlers learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints with almost no supervision. During this learning, they execute frequent eye and head movements that shape their visual experience. It is presently unclear if and how these behaviors contribute to toddlers' emerging object recognition abilities. To answer this question, we here combine head-mounted eye tracking during dyadic play with unsupervised machine learning. We approximate toddlers' central visual field experience by cropping image regions from a head-mounted camera centered on the current gaze location estimated via eye tracking. This visual stream feeds an unsupervised computational model of toddlers' learning, which constructs visual representations that slowly change over time. Our experiments demonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant object representations. Our analysis also shows that the limited size of the central visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior may support their development of view-invariant object recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement Dumas, Chris Wendler, Veniamin Veselovsky, Giovanni Monea, Robert West</p>
<p>Abstract: A central question in multilingual language modeling is whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal concept representation, disentangled from specific languages. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word-translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean representation of a concept across different languages does not affect the models' ability to translate it, but instead improves it. Finally, we generalize to multi-token generation and demonstrate that the model can generate natural language description of those mean representations. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Chen, Jiyuan Zhang, Zecheng Hao, Yajing Zheng, Tiejun Huang, Zhaofei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spike cameras, as an innovative neuromorphic camera that captures scenes with the 0-1 bit stream at 40 kHz, are increasingly employed for the 3D reconstruction task via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Previous spike-based 3D reconstruction approaches often employ a casecased pipeline: starting with high-quality image reconstruction from spike streams based on established spike-to-image reconstruction algorithms, then progressing to camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, this cascaded approach suffers from substantial cumulative errors, where quality limitations of initial image reconstructions negatively impact pose estimation, ultimately degrading the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a synergistic optimization framework, \textbf{USP-Gaussian}, that unifies spike-based image reconstruction, pose correction, and Gaussian splatting into an end-to-end framework. Leveraging the multi-view consistency afforded by 3DGS and the motion capture capability of the spike camera, our framework enables a joint iterative optimization that seamlessly integrates information between the spike-to-image network and 3DGS. Experiments on synthetic datasets with accurate poses demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches by effectively eliminating cascading errors. Moreover, we integrate pose optimization to achieve robust 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios with inaccurate initial poses, outperforming alternative methods by effectively reducing noise and preserving fine texture details. Our code, data and trained models will be available at https://github.com/chenkang455/USP-Gaussian.</p>

<p>Abstract: The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Nogueira Nobrega, Ewerton de Oliveira, Martin Saska, Tiago Nascimento</p>
<p>Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) is a growing area of research. In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Feng, Xiaotian Ma, Jiayi Sheng, Ziyuan Feng, Wei Song, Peng Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

<p>Abstract: Driven by the vision of ubiquitous connectivity and wireless intelligence, the evolution of ultra-dense constellation-based satellite-integrated Internet is underway, now taking preliminary shape. Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research on backdoor stealthiness focuses mainly on indistinguishable triggers in input space and inseparable backdoor representations in feature space, aiming to circumvent backdoor defenses that examine these respective spaces. However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a specific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of defense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are current backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse practical defenses?
  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on input-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative defenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks designed to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by examining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying causes behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and feature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter space, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking comprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack called Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective module, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the parameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against state-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset of ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the effectiveness of common backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jelena Bratuli\'c, Sudhanshu Mittal, David T. Hoffmann, Samuel B\"ohm, Robin Tibor Schirrmeister, Tonio Ball, Christian Rupprecht, Thomas Brox</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables the model to perform new tasks conditioning only on the examples provided in the context without updating the model's weights. While ICL offers fast adaptation across natural language tasks and domains, its emergence is less straightforward for modalities beyond text. In this work, we systematically uncover properties present in LLMs that support the emergence of ICL for autoregressive models and various modalities by promoting the learning of the needed mechanisms for ICL. We identify exact token repetitions in the training data sequences as an important factor for ICL. Such repetitions further improve stability and reduce transiency in ICL performance. Moreover, we emphasise the significance of training task difficulty for the emergence of ICL. Finally, by applying our novel insights on ICL emergence, we unlock ICL capabilities for various visual datasets and a more challenging EEG classification task in a few-shot learning regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eug\`ene Berta, David Holzm\"uller, Michael I. Jordan, Francis Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning classifiers often produce probabilistic predictions that are critical for accurate and interpretable decision-making in various domains. The quality of these predictions is generally evaluated with proper losses, such as cross-entropy, which decompose into two components: calibration error assesses general under/overconfidence, while refinement error measures the ability to distinguish different classes. In this paper, we present a novel variational formulation of the calibration-refinement decomposition that sheds new light on post-hoc calibration, and enables rapid estimation of the different terms. Equipped with this new perspective, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that calibration and refinement errors are not minimized simultaneously during training. Selecting the best epoch based on validation loss thus leads to a compromise point that is suboptimal for both terms. To address this, we propose minimizing refinement error only during training (Refine,...), before minimizing calibration error post hoc, using standard techniques (...then Calibrate). Our method integrates seamlessly with any classifier and consistently improves performance across diverse classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In 'red' mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/J-Rosser-UK/AgentBreeder.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are becoming more capable and widespread, the study of their failure cases is becoming increasingly important. Recent advances in standardizing, measuring, and scaling test-time compute suggest new methodologies for optimizing models to achieve high performance on hard tasks. In this paper, we apply these advances to the task of model jailbreaking: eliciting harmful responses from aligned LLMs. We develop an adversarial reasoning approach to automatic jailbreaking that leverages a loss signal to guide the test-time compute, achieving SOTA attack success rates against many aligned LLMs, even those that aim to trade inference-time compute for adversarial robustness. Our approach introduces a new paradigm in understanding LLM vulnerabilities, laying the foundation for the development of more robust and trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: A recent line of research has exploited pre-trained generative diffusion models as priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. We contribute to this research direction by designing a sequential Monte Carlo method for linear-Gaussian inverse problems which builds on "decoupled diffusion", where the generative process is designed such that larger updates to the sample are possible. The method is asymptotically exact and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Decoupled Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo (DDSMC) algorithm on both synthetic as well as protein and image data. Further, we demonstrate how the approach can be extended to discrete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Ekstr\"om Kelvinius, Oskar B. Andersson, Abhijith S. Parackal, Dong Qian, Rickard Armiento, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Bayramli, Ayhan Suleymanzade, Na Min An, Huzama Ahmad, Eunsu Kim, Junyeong Park, James Thorne, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently enabled the creation of visually compelling, detailed images from textual prompts. However, their ability to accurately represent various cultural nuances remains an open question. In our work, we introduce CultDiff benchmark, evaluating state-of-the-art diffusion models whether they can generate culturally specific images spanning ten countries. We show that these models often fail to generate cultural artifacts in architecture, clothing, and food, especially for underrepresented country regions, by conducting a fine-grained analysis of different similarity aspects, revealing significant disparities in cultural relevance, description fidelity, and realism compared to real-world reference images. With the collected human evaluations, we develop a neural-based image-image similarity metric, namely, CultDiff-S, to predict human judgment on real and generated images with cultural artifacts. Our work highlights the need for more inclusive generative AI systems and equitable dataset representation over a wide range of cultures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Wu, Jingwei Ni, Bryan Hooi, Jiaheng Zhang, Elliott Ash, See-Kiong Ng, Mrinmaya Sachan, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) can increase the informativeness of large language models (LLMs), but may reduce their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses containing long-tail knowledge that was not well covered during pre-training. As a result, models become more informative but less accurate when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate how unfamiliar knowledge in IFT datasets can negatively affect the truthfulness of LLMs, and we introduce two new IFT paradigms, $UNIT_{cut}$ and $UNIT_{ref}$, to address this issue. $UNIT_{cut}$ identifies and removes unfamiliar knowledge from IFT datasets to mitigate its impact on model truthfulness, whereas $UNIT_{ref}$ trains LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly indicate it at the end of their responses. Our experiments show that $UNIT_{cut}$ substantially improves LLM truthfulness, while $UNIT_{ref}$ maintains high informativeness and reduces hallucinations by distinguishing between confident and uncertain statements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guikun Chen, Xu Zhang, Xiaolin Hu, Yong Liu, Yi Yang, Wenguan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chemical reaction data is a pivotal asset, driving advances in competitive fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, and industrial chemistry. Its proprietary nature renders it sensitive, as it often includes confidential insights and competitive advantages organizations strive to protect. However, in contrast to this need for confidentiality, the current standard training paradigm for machine learning-based retrosynthesis gathers reaction data from multiple sources into one single edge to train prediction models. This paradigm poses considerable privacy risks as it necessitates broad data availability across organizational boundaries and frequent data transmission between entities, potentially exposing proprietary information to unauthorized access or interception during storage and transfer. In the present study, we introduce the chemical knowledge-informed framework (CKIF), a privacy-preserving approach for learning retrosynthesis models. CKIF enables distributed training across multiple chemical organizations without compromising the confidentiality of proprietary reaction data. Instead of gathering raw reaction data, CKIF learns retrosynthesis models through iterative, chemical knowledge-informed aggregation of model parameters. In particular, the chemical properties of predicted reactants are leveraged to quantitatively assess the observable behaviors of individual models, which in turn determines the adaptive weights used for model aggregation. On a variety of reaction datasets, CKIF outperforms several strong baselines by a clear margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yuan, Zichen Wang, Marcus Collins, Huzefa Rangwala</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce StructTokenBench, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop AminoAseed, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83% and 124.03%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Peng, Nuo Chen, Zongrui Suo, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), developing advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs remains a key challenge. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated exceptional promise in enhancing reasoning by providing step-wise feedback, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning. However, their application to broader reasoning domains remains understudied, largely due to the high costs associated with manually creating step-level supervision. In this work, we explore the potential of PRMs in graph reasoning problems - a domain that demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning and offers opportunities for automated step-level data generation using established graph algorithms. We introduce GraphSILO, the largest dataset for graph reasoning problems with fine-grained step-wise labels, built using automated Task-oriented Trajectories and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate detailed reasoning steps with step-wise labels. Building upon this dataset, we train GraphPRM, the first PRM designed for graph reasoning problems, and evaluate its effectiveness in two key settings: inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that GraphPRM significantly improves LLM performance across 13 graph reasoning tasks, delivering a 9% gain for Qwen2.5-7B and demonstrating transferability to new graph reasoning datasets and new reasoning domains like mathematical problem-solving. Notably, GraphPRM enhances LLM performance on GSM8K and Math500, underscoring the cross-domain applicability of graph-based reasoning rewards. Our findings highlight the potential of PRMs in advancing reasoning across diverse domains, paving the way for more versatile and effective LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Xu, Junlin Li, Wei Zhang, Siyu Chen, Shengyong Zhang, Yuquan Leng, Weijia Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D gaussian splatting has advanced simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology by enabling real-time positioning and the construction of high-fidelity maps. However, the uncertainty in gaussian position and initialization parameters introduces challenges, often requiring extensive iterative convergence and resulting in redundant or insufficient gaussian representations. To address this, we introduce a novel adaptive densification method based on Fourier frequency domain analysis to establish gaussian priors for rapid convergence. Additionally, we propose constructing independent and unified sparse and dense maps, where a sparse map supports efficient tracking via Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) and a dense map creates high-fidelity visual representations. This is the first SLAM system leveraging frequency domain analysis to achieve high-quality gaussian mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate an average frame rate of 36 FPS on Replica and TUM RGB-D datasets, achieving competitive accuracy in both localization and mapping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinkun Wang, Yifang Wang, Senwei Liang, Feilong Tang, Chengzhi Liu, Ming Hu, Chao Hu, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Boucher, John Whittle, Evangelos B. Mazomenos</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum vision transformers (QViTs), vision transformers (ViTs) with self-attention (SA) mechanisms replaced by quantum self-attention (QSA) mechanisms, can match state-of-the-art (SOTA) biomedical image classifiers while using 99.99% fewer parameters. QSAs are produced by replacing linear SA layers with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), producing a QSA mechanism and reducing parameter scaling from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. On RetinaMNIST, our ultra parameter-efficient QViT outperforms 13/14 SOTA methods including CNNs and ViTs, achieving 56.5% accuracy, just 0.88% below the top MedMamba model while using 99.99% fewer parameters (1K vs 14.5M) and 89% fewer GFLOPs. We present the first investigation of knowledge distillation (KD) from classical to quantum vision transformers in biomedical image classification, showing that QViTs maintain comparable performance to classical ViTs across eight diverse datasets spanning multiple modalities, with improved QSA parameter-efficiency. Our higher-qubit architecture benefitted more from KD pre-training, suggesting a scaling relationship between QSA parameters and KD effectiveness. These findings establish QSA as a practical architectural choice toward parameter-efficient biomedical image analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Caccia, Alan Ansell, Edoardo Ponti, Ivan Vuli\'c, Alessandro Sordoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Han, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanessa Borst, Timo Dittus, Tassilo Dege, Astrid Schmieder, Samuel Kounev</p>
<p>Abstract: Chronic wounds affect a large population, particularly the elderly and diabetic patients, who often exhibit limited mobility and co-existing health conditions. Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For a fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validation to minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the five best architectures based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations. Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, is integrated into a custom telehealth system.</p>

Unlike traditional paradigms that strongly rely on encoder-based state embeddings, our framework decouples the network design, simplifying the policy network and deployment. A high performance teacher policy is first trained using privileged information to acquire generalizable motion skills. The teacher's motion distribution is transferred to the student policy, which relies only on noisy proprioceptive data, via a generative adversarial mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by distributional shifts. Additionally, auxiliary task learning enhances the student policy's feature representation, speeding up convergence and improving adaptability to varying terrains. The framework is validated on a humanoid robot, showing a great improvement in locomotion stability on dynamic terrains and significant reductions in development costs. This work provides a practical solution for deploying robust locomotion strategies in humanoid robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vijay Ekambaram, Subodh Kumar, Arindam Jati, Sumanta Mukherjee, Tomoya Sakai, Pankaj Dayama, Wesley M. Gifford, Jayant Kalagnanam</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters (10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaveen Hiniduma, Dylan Ryan, Suren Byna, Jean Luca Bez, Ravi Madduri</p>
<p>Abstract: AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) is a framework to evaluate and improve data preparedness for AI applications. It addresses critical data readiness dimensions such as data quality, bias, fairness, and privacy. This paper details enhancements to AIDRIN by focusing on user interface improvements and integration with a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) framework. By refining the UI and enabling smooth integration with decentralized AI pipelines, AIDRIN becomes more accessible and practical for users with varying technical expertise. Integrating with an existing PPFL framework ensures that data readiness and privacy are prioritized in federated learning environments. A case study involving a real-world dataset demonstrates AIDRIN's practical value in identifying data readiness issues that impact AI model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaqiang Tang, Jian Li, Keyu Hu, Du Nan, Xiaolong Li, Xi Zhang, Weigao Sun, Sihong Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Faithfulness hallucinations are claims generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment standards, existing benchmarks focus on "factual statements" that rephrase source materials while overlooking "cognitive statements" that involve making inferences from the given context. Consequently, evaluating and detecting the hallucination of cognitive statements remains challenging. Inspired by how evidence is assessed in the legal domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels of faithfulness of cognitive statements and introduce the CogniBench dataset where we reveal insightful statistics. To keep pace with rapidly evolving LLMs, we further develop an automatic annotation pipeline that scales easily across different models. This results in a large-scale CogniBench-L dataset, which facilitates training accurate detectors for both factual and cognitive hallucinations. We release our model and datasets at: https://github.com/FUTUREEEEEE/CogniBench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Herzog, Aliai Eusebi, Lorenzo Cavallaro</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics, neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain reliable and stable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not. We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility in SOTA frameworks across datasets of varying drift suggests the need for a return to the whiteboard.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Nguyen, Yang Li, Olga Golovneva, Luke Zettlemoyer, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Xian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing (SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text, outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaying He, Yitong Lin, Jiahe Chen, Honghui Xu, Jianwei Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning module dedicated to refining boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a Dynamic Complementary Competition module that leverages two high-performing sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our approach achieves a notable improvement of at least 6%, highlighting the significant advancements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungho Baek, Taegeon Park, Jongchan Park, Seungjun Oh, Yusung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE) metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghoon Ahn, Jiwon Kang, Sanghyun Lee, Minjae Kim, Jaewon Min, Wooseok Jang, Saungwu Lee, Sayak Paul, Susung Hong, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Ziyuan Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Wang, Siyuan Liang, Zhe Liu, Yi Yu, Yuliang Lu, Xiaochun Cao, Ee-Chien Chang, Xitong Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

<p>Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models, conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard, and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhi Zhang, Zhaoxi Zhang, Haoxiang Guan, Yilin Cheng, Yitong Duan, Chen Wang, Yue Wang, Shuxin Zheng, Jiyan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.</p>

Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application, dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions, uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kui Huang, Xinrong Chen, Wenyu Lv, Jincheng Liao, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee, designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data. Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Yongxin Chen, Molei Tao, Guan-Horng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process, or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling. Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18240">Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Li, Chuan Wang, Hongdong Zhu, Qi Gao, Yin Ma, Hai Wei, Kai Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18251">Morse: Dual-Sampling for Lossless Acceleration of Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Li, Jiawei Fan, Anbang Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixin Wu, Na Cai, Qiao Cheng, Jiachen Wang, Yitao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Confucius3-Math, an open-source large language model with 14B parameters that (1) runs efficiently on a single consumer-grade GPU; (2) achieves SOTA performances on a range of mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming many models with significantly larger sizes. In particular, as part of our mission to enhancing education and knowledge dissemination with AI, Confucius3-Math is specifically committed to mathematics learning for Chinese K-12 students and educators. Built via post-training with large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), Confucius3-Math aligns with national curriculum and excels at solving main-stream Chinese K-12 mathematical problems with low cost. In this report we share our development recipe, the challenges we encounter and the techniques we develop to overcome them. In particular, we introduce three technical innovations: Targeted Entropy Regularization, Recent Sample Recovery and Policy-Specific Hardness Weighting. These innovations encompass a new entropy regularization, a novel data scheduling policy, and an improved group-relative advantage estimator. Collectively, they significantly stabilize the RL training, improve data efficiency, and boost performance. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of building strong reasoning models in a particular domain at low cost.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Xu, Yiwen Wang, Chi Xue, Xiangkun Hu, Xi Fang, Guimin Dong, Chandan K. Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143">Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul C. Bogdan, Uzay Macar, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified "broadcasting" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via "receiver" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Zhao, Ke Fan, He-Yang Xu, Ning Qiao, Bo Peng, Wenlong Gao, Dongjiang Li, Hui Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1) Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3) Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction, totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.</p>
