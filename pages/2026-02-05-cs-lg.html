<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Zhang, Huanyi Xie, Meng Ding, Shaopeng Fu, Jinyan Liu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Kuhn, Vandana Dwarka, Przemyslaw Karol Grenda, Eero Vainikko</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyuseong Choi, Dwaipayan Saha, Woojeong Kim, Anish Agarwal, Raaz Dwivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Fu, Wenxin Zhang, Chunlei Meng, Youjin Wang, Haoyu Zhao, Jiaxuan Lu, Kun Liu, JiaBao Dou, Simon James Fong</p>
<p>Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03906">GeoIB: Geometry-Aware Information Bottleneck via Statistical-Manifold Compression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqi Wang, Zhiyi Tian, Chenhan Zhang, Shui Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Weissmann, Tilman Aach, Benedikt Wille, Sebastian Kassing, Leif D\"oring</p>
<p>Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03912">Echo State Networks for Time Series Forecasting: Hyperparameter Sweep and Benchmarking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander H\"au{\ss}er</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for univariate time series forecasting using a subset of the M4 Forecasting Competition dataset. Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyu Wang (University of South China), Yaping Wan (University of South China)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles a critical bottleneck in Super-Structure-based divide-and-conquer causal discovery: the high computational cost of constructing accurate Super-Structures--particularly when conditional independence (CI) tests are expensive and domain knowledge is unavailable. We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc Hoang, Ajay Jaiswal, Mohammad Samragh, Minsik Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable sparse expert activation, meaning that only a subset of the model's parameters is used during each inference. However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Alonso, Tomas Figliolia, Beren Millidge</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard sequence mixing layers used in language models struggle to balance efficiency and performance. Self-attention performs well on long context tasks but has expensive quadratic compute and linear memory costs, while linear attention and SSMs use only linear compute and constant memory but struggle with long context processing. In this paper, we develop a sequence mixing layer that aims to find a better compromise between memory-compute costs and long-context processing, which we call online vector-quantized (OVQ) attention. OVQ-attention requires linear compute costs and constant memory, but, unlike linear attention and SSMs, it uses a sparse memory update that allows it to greatly increase the size of its memory state and, consequently, memory capacity. We develop a theoretical basis for OVQ-attention based on Gaussian mixture regression, and we test it on a variety of synthetic long context tasks and on long context language modeling. OVQ-attention shows significant improvements over linear attention baselines and the original VQ-attention, on which OVQ-attention was inspired. It demonstrates competitive, and sometimes identical, performance to strong self-attention baselines up 64k sequence length, despite using a small fraction of the memory of full self-attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Aich, Andreas F\"urst, Florian Sestak, Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez, Niklas Boers, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov, Duygu Erisken, Derya Umut Kulali, Taner Yilmaz, Rana Irem Turhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Affordable housing shortages affect billions, while land scarcity and regulations make site selection slow. We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular learning is still dominated by row-wise predictors that score each row independently, which fits i.i.d. benchmarks but fails on transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on other rows. We show that row-wise prediction rules out natural targets driven by global counts, overlaps, and relational patterns. To make "using structure" precise across architectures, we introduce grables: a modular interface that separates how a table is lifted to a graph (constructor) from how predictions are computed on that graph (node predictor), pinpointing where expressive power comes from. Experiments on synthetic tasks, transaction data, and a RelBench clinical-trials dataset confirm the predicted separations: message passing captures inter-row dependencies that row-local models miss, and hybrid approaches that explicitly extract inter-row structure and feed it to strong tabular learners yield consistent gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Zia, Farid Hazratian</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim, Md Rezaul Karim</p>
<p>Abstract: The predictive machine learning models for child mortality tend to be inaccurate when applied to future populations, since they suffer from look-ahead bias due to the randomization used in cross-validation. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall "Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient," with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Uriot, Elise Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful and popular dimensionality reduction technique. However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots. The code can be found on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aijie Shu, Wenbin Wu, Gbenga Ibikunle, Fengxiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Credit exposure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is often implicit and token-mediated, creating a dense web of inter-protocol dependencies. Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Bousias, Lars Lindemann, George Pappas</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the effect of group symmetrization of pre-trained models on conformal prediction (CP), a post-hoc, distribution-free, finite-sample method of uncertainty quantification that offers formal coverage guarantees under the assumption of data exchangeability. Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels. We then propose an experimental design to test these theoretical claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anish Sathyanarayanan, Aditya Nagarsekar, Aarush Rathore</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is widely assumed to expose a model's reasoning process and improve transparency. We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jusheng Zhang, Ningyuan Liu, Qinhan Lyu, Jing Yang, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks typically treat nonlinearities as fixed primitives (e.g., ReLU), limiting both interpretability and the granularity of control over the induced function class. While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Pad\'e-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Lotfian, Mohammad Jalali, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04019">Understanding and Guiding Layer Placement in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Xu, Yuyang Liang, Shan Dai, Tianyang Hu, Tsz Nam Chan, Chenhao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, the cost of full-parameter fine-tuning has made parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the default strategy for downstream adaptation. Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Gorla, Hugues Van Assel, Jan-Christian Huetter, Heming Yao, Kyunghyun Cho, Aviv Regev, Russell Littman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning approach for high-content perturbation data where samples across modalities are weakly paired through shared perturbation labels but lack direct correspondence. Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a consensus-based Bayesian framework to detect malicious user behavior in enterprise directory access graphs. By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors. Simulations over synthetic access graphs validate our method, demonstrating its sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Gorla, Ratish Puduppully</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular Language Models (TLMs) have been claimed to achieve emergent generalization for tabular prediction. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of Tabula-8B as a representative TLM, utilizing 165 datasets from the UniPredict benchmark. Our investigation reveals three findings. First, binary and categorical classification achieve near-zero median lift over majority-class baselines and strong aggregate performance is driven entirely by quartile classification tasks. Second, top-performing datasets exhibit pervasive contamination, including complete train-test overlap and task-level leakage that evades standard deduplication. Third, instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers 92.2% of standard classification performance and on quartile classification, format familiarity closes 71.3% of the gap with the residual attributable to contaminated datasets. These findings suggest claimed generalization likely reflects evaluation artifacts rather than learned tabular reasoning. We conclude with recommendations for strengthening TLM evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Wang, Qinghang Liu, Haotian Lin, Yiheng Li, Guojian Zhan, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Yixiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning domain adaptive policies that can generalize to unseen transition dynamics, remains a fundamental challenge in learning-based control. Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods. More visualization results are available on the https://outsider86.github.io/DomainAdaptiveDiffusionPolicy/.</p>

Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities. Empirically, we demonstrate improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests, along with robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huahua Lin, Katayoun Farrahi, Xiaohao Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how neural representations respond to geometric transformations is essential for evaluating whether learned features preserve meaningful spatial structure. Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gautam Choudhary, Libin Zhou, Yeasir Rayhan, Walid G. Aref</p>
<p>Abstract: The calculation of shortest-path distances in road networks is a core operation in navigation systems, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.</p>

As new work continues to appear after publication, surveys quickly become outdated, contributing to redundancy and fragmentation in the literature. We reframe survey writing as a long-horizon maintenance problem rather than a one-time generation task, treating surveys as living documents that evolve alongside the research they describe. We propose an agentic Dynamic Survey Framework that supports the continuous updating of existing survey papers by incrementally integrating new work while preserving survey structure and minimizing unnecessary disruption.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'ois\'in Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).</p>

<p>Abstract: Deterministic neural operators perform well on many PDEs but can struggle with the approximation of high-frequency wave phenomena, where strong input-to-output sensitivity makes operator learning challenging, and spectral bias blurs oscillations. We argue for adopting a probabilistic approach for approximating waves in high-frequency regime, and develop our probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator. After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field. We envision that our results position probabilistic operator learning as a principled and effective approach for solving complex PDEs such as Helmholtz in the challenging high-frequency regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dario Fenoglio, Arianna Casanova, Francesco De Santis, Mohan Li, Gabriele Dominici, Johannes Schneider, Martin Gjoreski, Marc Langheinrich, Pietro Barbiero, Giovanni De Felice</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based models (CMs) enhance interpretability in deep learning by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines. Notably, F-CMs enable interpretable inference on concepts not available to a given institution, a key novelty with respect to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Zhai, Sabbir Mollah, Zhenyi Wang, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) is hindered by context rigidity: tokens are retained based on transient high confidence, often ignoring that early predictions lack full context. This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points.</p>

<p>Abstract: Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kosuke Sugiyama, Masato Uchida</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic perspective on generalization in machine learning by framing the learning problem within the context of lossy compression and applying finite blocklength analysis. In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Chu, Jaewoong Choi, Dohyun Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-dual neural optimal transport learns a transport map via a max-min objective, yet training can converge to incorrect or degenerate maps. We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. This provides a principled stopping rule: annealing below $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ can $\textit{worsen}$ optimization conditioning without improving statistical accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit K. Chakraborty, Hao Wang, Pouria Ramazi</p>
<p>Abstract: The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Liu, Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Ru Zhang, Hongchao Qin, Ronghua Li, Guoren Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John X. Morris, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Mark Ibrahim, Saeed Mahloujifar</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that language models can learn to \textit{reason}, often via reinforcement learning. Some work even trains low-rank parameterizations for reasoning, but conventional LoRA cannot scale below the model dimension. We question whether even rank=1 LoRA is necessary for learning to reason and propose TinyLoRA, a method for scaling low-rank adapters to sizes as small as one parameter. Within our new parameterization, we are able to train the 8B parameter size of Qwen2.5 to 91\% accuracy on GSM8K with only 13 trained parameters in bf16 (26 total bytes). We find this trend holds in general: we are able to recover 90\% of performance improvements while training $1000x$ fewer parameters across a suite of more difficult learning-to-reason benchmarks such as AIME, AMC, and MATH500. Notably, we are only able to achieve such strong performance with RL: models trained using SFT require $100-1000x$ larger updates to reach the same performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonah Kim, Minsu Kim, Celine Roget, Dionessa Biton, Louis Vaillancourt, Yves V. Brun, Yoshua Bengio, Alex Hernandez-Garcia</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of generative models for experimental drug discovery campaigns is severely limited by the difficulty of designing molecules de novo that can be synthesized in practice. Previous works have leveraged Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to impose hard synthesizability constraints through the design of state and action spaces based on predefined reaction templates and building blocks. Despite the promising prospects of this approach, it currently lacks flexibility and scalability. As an alternative, we propose S3-GFN, which generates synthesizable SMILES molecules via simple soft regularization of a sequence-based GFlowNet. Our approach leverages rich molecular priors learned from large-scale SMILES corpora to steer molecular generation towards high-reward, synthesizable chemical spaces. The model induces constraints through off-policy replay training with a contrastive learning signal based on separate buffers of synthesizable and unsynthesizable samples. Our experiments show that S3-GFN learns to generate synthesizable molecules ($\geq 95\%$) with higher rewards in diverse tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samaresh Kumar Singh, Joyjit Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrdad Moghimi, Anthony Coache, Hyejin Ku</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains for its ability to optimize risk-sensitive objectives. However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning discretization-invariant function-to-function mappings in scientific computing. However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Li, Chengsong Huang, Langlin Huang, Shaoyang Xu, Haolin Liu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiaxin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains is critical for real-world applications, yet existing spatiotemporal models often suffer from performance degradation under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts. We address these challenges through the lens of structure-aware context selection. We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference is often bounded by memory footprint and memory bandwidth in resource-constrained deployments, making quantization a fundamental technique for efficient serving. While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiling Jin, Fei Wang, Xiaoyun Yuan, Chen Qian, Yuan Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Static sparse training is a promising route to efficient learning by committing to a fixed mask pattern, yet the constrained structure reduces robustness. Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Qiu, Taewon Yang, Zhanhao Liu, Guanyang Wang, Liyue Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have become a powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems in scientific and engineering domains. Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Anand, Alec Helbling, Mark Davenport, Gordon Berman, Sankar Alagapan, Christopher Rozell</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning the intrinsic dimensionality of subjective perceptual spaces such as taste, smell, or aesthetics from ordinal data is a challenging problem. We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, "Is A more similar to B than C?". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Tong, Peng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from sparse point-sensor measurements is a central challenge in learning parametric PDE dynamics. Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved tremendous success with their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet also face safety issues similar to those of basic language models. In particular, while algorithms are designed to guide them to deliberately refuse harmful prompts with safe reasoning, this process often fails to generalize against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks. In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Maleki, Rushendra Sidibomma, Arman Adibi, Reza Samavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, as formal guarantees often require solving non-convex problems. Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to train a graph foundation model that is able to represent any graph as a vector preserving structural and semantic information useful for downstream graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph clustering. To learn the features of graphs from diverse domains while maintaining strong generalization ability to new domains, we propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method, which constructs weighted graphs using the attributes of all nodes in each dataset and then generates consistent node embeddings. To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation. We also provide a theoretical generalization bound to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results of few-shot graph classification and graph clustering show that our model outperforms strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Pan, Yuhao Tang, Wanfu Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In partial multi-label learning (PML), the true labels are unobserved, which makes label disambiguation important but difficult. A key challenge is that ambiguous candidate labels can propagate errors into downstream tasks such as feature engineering. To solve this issue, we jointly model the disambiguation and feature selection tasks as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to turn PML risk minimization into expected-return maximization. Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size. Experiments in multiple metrics and data sets verify the advantages of the framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Albool, Malak Gamal El-Din, Salma Elmalaki, Yasser Shoukry</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual connections are the de facto standard for mitigating vanishing gradients, yet they impose structural constraints and fail to address the inherent inefficiencies of piecewise linear activations. We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenze Lin, Zhen Yang, Xitai Jiang, Pony Ma, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it frequently encounters challenges such as entropy collapse, excessive verbosity, and insufficient exploration for hard problems. Crucially, existing reward schemes fail to distinguish between the need for extensive search during problem-solving and the efficiency required for mastered knowledge. In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes "thickening" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to "thinning", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noga Mudrik, Yuxi Chen, Gal Mishne, Adam S. Charles</p>
<p>Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyankkumar Dhrangdhariya, Soumyadipta Maiti, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: Non Pneumatic tires offer a promising alternative to pneumatic tires. However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs. Overall, the proposed framework enables systematic development of high performance, next generation UPTIS spoke structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzhuo Chen, Anthony Poole, Ionut-Gabriel Farcas, David R. Hatch, Ulisses Braga-Neto</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Convolutional Operator Network for Forward and Inverse Problems (FI-Conv), a framework capable of predicting system evolution and estimating parameters in complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence. FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudipto Ghosh, Sujoy Nath, Sunny Manchanda, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-expert systems, where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate to solve complex tasks, are increasingly adopted for high-performance reasoning and generation. However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures remains challenging: while spherical-harmonic equivariant models are expressive, their Clebsch-Gordan tensor products incur substantial compute and memory costs for higher-order targets. We propose the Cartesian Environment Interaction Tensor Network (CEITNet), an approach that constructs a multi-channel Cartesian local environment tensor for each atom and performs flexible many-body mixing via a learnable channel-space interaction. By performing learning in channel space and using Cartesian tensor bases to assemble equivariant outputs, CEITNet enables efficient construction of high-order tensor. Across benchmark datasets for order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensor prediction, CEITNet surpasses prior high-order prediction methods on key accuracy criteria while offering high computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling strategies have effectively leveraged inference-time compute to enhance the reasoning abilities of Autoregressive Large Language Models. In this work, we demonstrate that Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) are inherently amenable to advanced search strategies, owing to their iterative and non-autoregressive generation process. To leverage this, we propose UnMaskFork (UMF), a framework that formulates the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the generation path. In contrast to standard scaling methods relying on stochastic sampling, UMF explores the search space through deterministic partial unmasking actions performed by multiple MDLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that UMF consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines on complex coding benchmarks, while also exhibiting strong scalability on mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Meng, Liangyu Huo, Yadan Luo, Yaowei Wang, Yingjian Li, Zheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear attention significantly reduces the computational complexity of Transformers from quadratic to linear, yet it consistently lags behind softmax-based attention in performance. We identify the root cause of this degradation as the non-negativity constraint imposed on kernel feature maps: standard projections like ReLU act as "passive truncation" operators, indiscriminately discarding semantic information residing in the negative domain. We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing. MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, demonstrating that strictly linear efficiency can be achieved without compromising representational fidelity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative machine learning (ML) without a central server, making it suitable for settings where training data cannot be centrally hosted. We introduce Mosaic Learning, a DL framework that decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently across the network. Fragmentation reduces redundant communication across correlated parameters and enables more diverse information propagation without increasing communication cost. We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline. In summary, Mosaic Learning improves DL performance without sacrificing its utility or efficiency, and positions itself as a new DL standard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiapeng Liu, Liang Li, Bing Li, Peng Fu, Xiyan Gao, Chengyang Fang, Xiaoshuai Hao, Can Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works focus on synthesizing Chart Understanding (ChartU) training sets to inject advanced chart knowledge into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where the sufficiency of the knowledge is typically verified by quantifying capability gains via the fine-tune-then-evaluate paradigm. However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been great success in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geethen Singh, Jasper A Slingsby, Tamara B Robinson, Glenn Moncrieff</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, "Common Ground", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policy optimization methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants have achieved strong results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\pm$0.2 versus $\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning.</p>

Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing.

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used to support decision-making. To verify their reliability and adaptability, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of tools and methods for tasks such as NN code verification, refactoring, and migration. These tools play a crucial role in guaranteeing both the correctness and maintainability of neural network architectures, helping to prevent implementation errors, simplify model updates, and ensure that complex networks can be reliably extended and reused. Yet, assessing their effectiveness remains challenging due to the lack of publicly diverse datasets of neural networks that would allow systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a dataset of neural networks that can serve as a benchmark for validation. The dataset is designed to cover diverse architectural components and to handle multiple input data types and tasks. In total, 608 samples are generated, each conforming to a set of precise design choices. To further ensure their consistency, we validate the correctness of the generated networks using static analysis and symbolic tracing. We make the dataset publicly available to support the community in advancing research on neural network reliability and adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distributed training of foundation models via $\texttt{DDP}$ is limited by interconnect bandwidth. While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\approx 10 \times$. Finally, we show that $\texttt{LoRDO}$ improves performance even more in very low-memory settings with small rank/batch size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatrice Achilli, Marco Benedetti, Giulio Biroli, Marc M\'ezard</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhou Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjun Zhang, Jimmy Ba</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA. Overall, we show that EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and powerful approach to scaling RL for LLMs. Code: https://github.com/LunjunZhang/ema-pg</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan N\"other, Adish Singla, Goran Radanovic</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but they also introduce significant safety risks when individual agents fail or behave adversarially. In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Towa Sano, Gouhei Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Frisoni, Lorenzo Molfetta, Davide Freddi, Gianluca Moro</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern chess language models are dense transformers trained on millions of games played by thousands of high-rated individuals. However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Liang, Yuhui Wang, Tanqiu Jiang, Ting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models introduce unique challenges for safety alignment due to their sparse routing mechanisms, which can enable degenerate optimization behaviors under standard full-parameter fine-tuning. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Our results suggest that robust MoE safety alignment benefits from targeted expert repair rather than global parameter updates, offering a practical and architecture-preserving alternative to prior approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Guo, Paul Sheridan</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention head pruning has emerged as an effective technique for transformer model compression, an increasingly important goal in the era of Green AI. However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulrahman Alotaibi, Irene Tenison, Miriam Kim, Isaac Lee, Lalana Kagal</p>
<p>Abstract: The Web is naturally heterogeneous with user devices, geographic regions, browsing patterns, and contexts all leading to highly diverse, unique datasets. Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets. This work advances the vision of scalable, privacy-preserving intelligence for real-world heterogeneous and distributed web systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sander de Haan, Yassine Taoudi-Benchekroun, Pau Vilimelis Aceituno, Benjamin F. Grewe</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge for neural networks when tasks are trained sequentially. In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry Yarotsky, Eugene Golikov, Yaroslav Gusev</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes and derive explicit analytic solutions for gradient flow (GF) in large learning problems. Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics. We observe a very good agreement of our theoretical predictions with experiment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pourya Shamsolmoali, Masoumeh Zareapoor</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from a stream of tasks usually pits plasticity against stability: acquiring new knowledge often causes catastrophic forgetting of past information. Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Klees, Tobias Riedlinger, Peter Stehr, Bennet B\"oddecker, Daniel Kondermann, Matthias Rottmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe artificial intelligence for perception tasks remains a major challenge, partly due to the lack of data with high-quality labels. Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikola Milosevic, Leonard Franz, Daniel Haeufle, Georg Martius, Nico Scherf, Pavel Kolev</p>
<p>Abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) provide a principled model for handling constraints, such as safety and other auxiliary objectives, in reinforcement learning. The common approach of using additive-cost constraints and dual variables often hinders off-policy scalability. We propose a Control as Inference formulation based on stochastic decision horizons, where constraint violations attenuate reward contributions and shorten the effective planning horizon via state-action-dependent continuation. This yields survival-weighted objectives that remain replay-compatible for off-policy actor-critic learning. We propose two violation semantics, absorbing and virtual termination, that share the same survival-weighted return but result in distinct optimization structures that lead to SAC/MPO-style policy improvement. Experiments demonstrate improved sample efficiency and favorable return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. Moreover, MPO with virtual termination (VT-MPO) scales effectively to our high-dimensional musculoskeletal Hyfydy setup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maya Janvier, Julien Salomon, Etienne Meunier</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid models and Neural Differential Equations (NDE) are getting increasingly important for the modeling of physical systems, however they often encounter stability and accuracy issues during long-term integration. Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Hu, Yue Ma, Yifan Wu, Yunhe Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.</p>

<p>Abstract: GRPO-style reinforcement learning (RL)-based LLM fine-tuning algorithms have recently gained popularity. Relying on heuristic trust-region approximations, however, they can lead to brittle optimization behavior, as global importance-ratio clipping and group-wise normalization fail to regulate samples whose importance ratios fall outside the clipping range. We propose Query-Adaptive Trust-Region policy Optimization (QUATRO), which directly enforces trust-region constraints through a principled optimization. This yields a clear and interpretable objective that enables explicit control over policy updates and stable, entropy-controlled optimization, with a stabilizer terms arising intrinsically from the exact trust-region formulation. Empirically verified on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, QUATRO shows stable training under increased policy staleness and aggressive learning rates, maintaining well-controlled entropy throughout training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein inverse folding, the task of predicting amino acid sequences for desired structures, is pivotal for de novo protein design. However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a "single-pass" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions. Extensive experiments on CATH 4.2, TS50, and TS500 benchmarks demonstrate that our geometric framework is highly competitive, while RIGA-Fold* significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both sequence recovery and structural consistency.</p>

To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipan Maity</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04663">Rethinking the Design Space of Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Models: On the Importance of Likelihood Estimation Beyond Loss Design</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Yuchen Zhu, Wei Guo, Petr Molodyk, Bo Yuan, Jinbin Bai, Yi Xin, Molei Tao, Yongxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianbiao Qi, Marco Chen, Jiaquan Ye, Yelin He, Rong Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panagiotis Theodoropoulos, Juno Nam, Evangelos Theodorou, Jaemoo Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Transportation on graphs is a fundamental challenge across many domains, where decisions must respect topological and operational constraints. Despite the need for actionable policies, existing graph-transport methods lack this expressivity. They rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to generalize across sparse topologies, and scale poorly with graph size and time horizon. To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ondrej Tybl, Lukas Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zhou, Zhirui Wang, Qi Hong, Yunyang Shi, Ziyuan Gu, Zhiyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting in real-world applications requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahima Lakra, Ronan Fablet, Lucas Drumetz, Etienne Pauthenet, Elodie Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04709">Towards Understanding and Avoiding Limitations of Convolutions on Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Stradiotti, Laurens Devos, Anna Monreale, Jesse Davis, Andrea Pugnana</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-horizon time-series forecasting involves simultaneously making predictions for a consecutive sequence of subsequent time steps. This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Miller, Florent Draye, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neville Mathew, Yidan Shen, Renjie Hu, Maham Rahimi, George Zouridakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Cuffless blood pressure screening based on easily acquired photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a practical pathway toward scalable cardiovascular health assessment. Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards. Our results show that existing PPG-based BP estimation models lack clinical practicality under standardized conditions, while incorporating demographic information markedly improves their accuracy and physiological validity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Wu, Rui Jiao, Qi Li, Mingze Li, Songyou Li, Shifeng Jin, Wenbing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengru Wang, Zhenqian Xu, Junfeng Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kejiang Qian, Amos Storkey, Fengxiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.</p>

To address this, we study the query-key (QK) space -- the bilinear joint embedding space between queries and keys. We present a contrastive covariance method to decompose the QK space into low-rank, human-interpretable components. It is when features in keys and queries align in these low-rank subspaces that high attention scores are produced. We first study our method both analytically and empirically in a simplified setting. We then apply our method to large language models to identify human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic features and binding features. Finally, we demonstrate how attention scores can be attributed to our identified features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Ye, Zixuan Qi, Shixuan Li, Wei Qi, Yanpeng Cai, Chaoxia Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Chen, Jie Peng, Moajjem Hossain Chowdhury, Tianlong Chen, Yunmei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and timely seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is critical for clinical intervention, yet manual review of long-term recordings is labor-intensive. Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Deng, He Li, Tianhong Li, Yilun Du, Kaiming He</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Li, Matthew M. Engelhard</p>
<p>Abstract: In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emil Albrychiewicz, Andr\'es Franco Valiente, Li-Ching Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mumin Zhang, Haochen Zhang, Xin Zhi Khoo, Yilin Zhang, Nuo Chen, Ting Zhang, Junjie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: With more wind farms clustered for integration, the short-term wind speed prediction of such wind farm clusters is critical for normal operation of power systems. This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kieran A. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: We make the information transmitted by attention an explicit, measurable quantity in vision transformers. By inserting variational information bottlenecks on all attention-mediated writes to the residual stream -- without other architectural changes -- we train models with an explicit information cost and obtain a controllable spectrum from independent patch processing to fully expressive global attention. On ImageNet-100, we characterize how classification behavior and information routing evolve across this spectrum, and provide initial insights into how global visual representations emerge from local patch processing by analyzing the first attention heads that transmit information. By biasing learning toward solutions with constrained internal communication, our approach yields models that are more tractable for mechanistic analysis and more amenable to control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congjing Zhang, Ryan Feng Lin, Ruoxuan Bao, Shuai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Vu Thanh, Nicolas Gillis</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wolfgang Maass, Sabine Janzen, Prajvi Saxena, Sach Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Bates, Chris Hicks, Vasilios Mavroudis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joydeep Chandra, Satyam Kumar Navneet, Aleksandr Algazinov, Yong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Nazari, T. Konstantin Rusch</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04861">From Evaluation to Design: Using Potential Energy Surface Smoothness Metrics to Guide Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Architectures</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Liu, Eric Qu, Tobias Kreiman, Samuel M. Blau, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannick Denker, Alexander Gepperth</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) requires agents to learn from a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired policies. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have transformed many applications but remain expensive to train. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Qi, Xiangxin Zhou, Zichen Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanru Qu, Cheng-Yen Hsieh, Zaixiang Zheng, Ge Liu, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Li, Disha Biswas, Peng Zhou, Wesley H. Brigner, Anna Capuano, Joseph S. Friedman, Qing Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: While software implementations of neural networks have driven significant advances in computation, the von Neumann architecture imposes fundamental limitations on speed and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyu Zhao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, Tie-Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The "AI Scientist" paradigm is transforming scientific research by automating key stages of the research process, from idea generation to scholarly writing. This shift is expected to accelerate discovery and expand the scope of scientific inquiry. However, a key question remains unclear: can AI scientists identify meaningful research questions? While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied successfully to task-specific ideation, their potential to conduct strategic, long-term assessments of past breakthroughs and future questions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore a human-AI hybrid solution that integrates the scalable data processing capabilities of AI with the value judgment of human experts. Our methodology is structured in three phases. The first phase, AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, leverages AI's advantage in processing vast amounts of literature to generate a hybrid information base. The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines. Our analysis reveals that while AI agents demonstrate high alignment with human experts in recognizing established breakthroughs, they exhibit greater divergence in forecasting prospective questions, suggesting that human judgment remains crucial for evaluating subjective, forward-looking challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inverse problems are often ill-posed and require optimization schemes with strong stability and convergence guarantees. While learning-based approaches such as deep unrolling and meta-learning achieve strong empirical performance, they typically lack explicit control over descent and curvature, limiting robustness. We propose a learned Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework for inverse problems within a bilevel optimization setting. Instead of learning a full optimizer, we learn a structured curvature majorant that governs each MM step while preserving classical MM descent guarantees. The majorant is parameterized by a lightweight recurrent neural network and explicitly constrained to satisfy valid MM conditions. For cosine-similarity losses, we derive explicit curvature bounds yielding diagonal majorants. When analytic bounds are unavailable, we rely on efficient Hessian-vector product-based spectral estimation to automatically upper-bound local curvature without forming the Hessian explicitly. Experiments on EEG source imaging demonstrate improved accuracy, stability, and cross-dataset generalization over deep-unrolled and meta-learning baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset, a comprehensive dataset to serve both as a benchmark for radar pulse deinterleaving research and as an enabler of new research methods. The dataset addresses the critical problem of separating interleaved radar pulses from multiple unknown emitters for electronic warfare applications and signal intelligence. Our dataset contains a total of 6000 pulse trains over two receiver configurations, totalling to almost 3 billion pulses, featuring realistic scenarios with up to 110 emitters and significant parameter space overlap. To encourage dataset adoption and establish standardised evaluation procedures, we have launched an accompanying Turing Deinterleaving Challenge, for which models need to associate pulses in interleaved pulse trains to the correct emitter by clustering and maximising metrics such as the V-measure. The Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset is one of the first publicly available, comprehensively simulated pulse train datasets aimed to facilitate sophisticated model development in the electronic warfare community</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuntaro Suzuki, Shuitsu Koyama, Shinnosuke Hirano, Shunya Nagashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) plays a crucial role in continuous cardiovascular health monitoring as a non-invasive and cost-effective modality. However, PPG signals are susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, making accurate estimation of vital signs such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) challenging. Existing estimation methods are often restricted to a single-task or environment, limiting their generalizability across diverse PPG decoding scenarios. Moreover, recent general-purpose approaches typically rely on predictions over multi-second intervals, discarding the morphological characteristics of vital signs. To address these challenges, we propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework that extends deep state space models, enabling fine-grained conditioning on PPG for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms. We evaluate PENGUIN using six real-world PPG datasets across three distinct vital sign reconstruction tasks (electrocardiogram reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring). Our method consistently outperformed both task-specific and general-purpose baselines, demonstrating PENGUIN as a general framework for robust vital sign reconstruction from PPG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Bayeh, Samira Sadaoui, Malek Mouhoub</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxx Richard Rahman, Mostafa Hammouda, Wolfgang Maass</p>
<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshansh Mishra, Rakesh Morisetty</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin G. Frasch, Marlene J. E. Mayer, Clara Becker, Peter Zimmermann, Camilla Zelgert, Marta C. Antonelli, Silvia M. Lobmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Prenatal psychological stress affects 15-25% of pregnancies and increases risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current screening relies on subjective questionnaires (PSS-10), limiting continuous monitoring. We developed deep learning models for stress detection from electrocardiography (ECG) using the FELICITy 1 cohort (151 pregnant women, 32-38 weeks gestation). A ResNet-34 encoder was pretrained via SimCLR contrastive learning on 40,692 ECG segments per subject. Multi-layer feature extraction enabled binary classification and continuous PSS prediction across maternal (mECG), fetal (fECG), and abdominal ECG (aECG). External validation used the FELICITy 2 RCT (28 subjects, different ECG device, yoga intervention vs. control). On FELICITy 1 (5-fold CV): mECG 98.6% accuracy (R2=0.88, MAE=1.90), fECG 99.8% (R2=0.95, MAE=1.19), aECG 95.5% (R2=0.75, MAE=2.80). External validation on FELICITy 2: mECG 77.3% accuracy (R2=0.62, MAE=3.54, AUC=0.826), aECG 63.6% (R2=0.29, AUC=0.705). Signal quality-based channel selection outperformed all-channel averaging (+12% R2 improvement). Mixed-effects models detected a significant intervention response (p=0.041). Self-supervised deep learning on pregnancy ECG enables accurate, objective stress assessment, with multi-layer feature extraction substantially outperforming single embedding approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised learning, but maximum likelihood estimation via EM suffers from degeneracy as components collapse. We introduce transcendental regularization, a penalized likelihood framework with analytic barrier functions that prevent degeneracy while maintaining asymptotic efficiency. The resulting Transcendental Algorithm for Mixtures of Distributions (TAMD) offers strong theoretical guarantees: identifiability, consistency, and robustness. Empirically, TAMD successfully stabilizes estimation and prevents collapse, yet achieves only modest improvements in classification accuracy-highlighting fundamental limits of mixture models for unsupervised learning in high dimensions. Our work provides both a novel theoretical framework and an honest assessment of practical limitations, implemented in an open-source R package.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxing Zhou, Yanghao Zhou, Yaoting Wang, Zongyan Han, Jiaqi Ma, Henghui Ding, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuwei Tan, Ziyu Hu, Xueru Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Poisson-distributed latent variable models are widely used in computational neuroscience, but differentiating through discrete stochastic samples remains challenging. Two approaches address this: Exponential Arrival Time (EAT) simulation and Gumbel-SoftMax (GSM) relaxation. We provide the first systematic comparison of these methods, along with practical guidance for practitioners. Our main technical contribution is a modification to the EAT method that theoretically guarantees an unbiased first moment (exactly matching the firing rate), and reduces second-moment bias. We evaluate these methods on their distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and performance on two tasks: (1) variational autoencoders with Poisson latents, and (2) partially observable generalized linear models, where latent neural connectivity must be inferred from observed spike trains. Across all metrics, our modified EAT method exhibits better overall performance (often comparable to exact gradients), and substantially higher robustness to hyperparameter choices. Together, our results clarify the trade-offs between these methods and offer concrete recommendations for practitioners working with Poisson latent variable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilles Bareilles, Wassim Bouaziz, Julien Fageot, El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Aggregation rules are the cornerstone of distributed (or federated) learning in the presence of adversaries, under the so-called Byzantine threat model. They are also interesting mathematical objects from the point of view of robust mean estimation. The Krum aggregation rule has been extensively studied, and endowed with formal robustness and convergence guarantees. Yet, MultiKrum, a natural extension of Krum, is often preferred in practice for its superior empirical performance, even though no theoretical guarantees were available until now. In this work, we provide the first proof that MultiKrum is a robust aggregation rule, and bound its robustness coefficient. To do so, we introduce $\kappa^\star$, the optimal *robustness coefficient* of an aggregation rule, which quantifies the accuracy of mean estimation in the presence of adversaries in a tighter manner compared with previously adopted notions of robustness. We then construct an upper and a lower bound on MultiKrum's robustness coefficient. As a by-product, we also improve on the best-known bounds on Krum's robustness coefficient. We show that MultiKrum's bounds are never worse than Krum's, and better in realistic regimes. We illustrate this analysis by an experimental investigation on the quality of the lower bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiying Zhang, Shuhao Zhang, Pierre Vandergheynst, Patrick Barth</p>
<p>Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), primary targets for over one-third of approved therapeutics, rely on intricate conformational transitions to transduce signals. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) is essential for elucidating this transduction process, particularly within ligand-bound complexes, conventional all-atom MD simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce GPCRLMD, a deep generative framework for efficient all-atom GPCR-ligand simulation.GPCRLMD employs a Harmonic-Prior Variational Autoencoder (HP-VAE) to first map the complex into a regularized isometric latent space, preserving geometric topology via physics-informed constraints. Within this latent space, a Residual Latent Flow samples evolution trajectories, which are subsequently decoded back to atomic coordinates. By capturing temporal dynamics via relative displacements anchored to the initial structure, this residual mechanism effectively decouples static topology from dynamic fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that GPCRLMD achieves state-of-the-art performance in GPCR-ligand dynamics simulation, faithfully reproducing thermodynamic observables and critical ligand-receptor interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuming Luo, Tao Zeng, Feng Li, Heming Liu, Rui Mao, Chang Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyang Shi, Michael Dorothy, Jie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the policy synthesis problem in contextual partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs), where the environment is governed by an unknown latent context that induces distinct POMDP dynamics. Our goal is to design a policy that simultaneously maximizes cumulative return and actively reduces uncertainty about the underlying context. We introduce an information-directed objective that augments reward maximization with mutual information between the latent context and the agent's observations. We develop the C-IDS algorithm to synthesize policies that maximize the information-directed objective. We show that the objective can be interpreted as a Lagrangian relaxation of the linear information ratio and prove that the temperature parameter is an upper bound on the information ratio. Based on this characterization, we establish a sublinear Bayesian regret bound over K episodes. We evaluate our approach on a continuous Light-Dark environment and show that it consistently outperforms standard POMDP solvers that treat the unknown context as a latent state variable, achieving faster context identification and higher returns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bibhabasu Mandal, Sagnik Nandy</p>
<p>Abstract: In sensitive applications involving relational datasets, protecting information about individual links from adversarial queries is of paramount importance. In many such settings, the available data are summarized solely through the degrees of the nodes in the network. We adopt the $\beta$ model, which is the prototypical statistical model adopted for this form of aggregated relational information, and study the problem of minimax-optimal parameter estimation under both local and central differential privacy constraints. We establish finite sample minimax lower bounds that characterize the precise dependence of the estimation risk on the network size and the privacy parameters, and we propose simple estimators that achieve these bounds up to constants and logarithmic factors under both local and central differential privacy frameworks. Our results provide the first comprehensive finite sample characterization of privacy utility trade offs for parameter estimation in $\beta$ models, addressing the classical graph case and extending the analysis to higher order hypergraph models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic data and a real world communication network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emrah Akyol</p>
<p>Abstract: We study strategic Gaussian semantic compression under rate and compute constraints, where an encoder and decoder optimize distinct quadratic objectives. A latent Gaussian state generates a task dependent semantic variable, and the decoder best responds via MMSE estimation, reducing the encoder's problem to posterior covariance design under an information rate constraint. We characterize the strategic rate distortion function in direct, remote, and full information regimes, derive semantic waterfilling and rate constrained Gaussian persuasion solutions, and establish Gaussian optimality under misaligned objectives. We further show that architectural compute limits act as implicit rate constraints, yielding exponential improvements in semantic accuracy with model depth and inference time compute, while multimodal observation eliminates the geometric mean penalty inherent to remote encoding. These results provide information theoretic foundations for data and energy efficient AI and offer a principled interpretation of modern multimodal language models as posterior design mechanisms under resource constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Basarkar (DK), Benyamin Tabarsi (DK), Tiffany Barnes (DK),  Dongkuan (DK),  Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanjun Lang, Xiong Wang, Fei Lu, Mauro Maggioni</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework for the joint inference of network topology, multi-type interaction kernels, and latent type assignments in heterogeneous interacting particle systems from multi-trajectory data. This learning task is a challenging non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem, which we address through a novel three-stage approach. First, we leverage shared structure across agent interactions to recover a low-rank embedding of the system parameters via matrix sensing. Second, we identify discrete interaction types by clustering within the learned embedding. Third, we recover the network weight matrix and kernel coefficients through matrix factorization and a post-processing refinement. We provide theoretical guarantees with estimation error bounds under a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) assumption and establish conditions for the exact recovery of interaction types based on cluster separability. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, including heterogeneous predator-prey systems, demonstrate that our method yields an accurate reconstruction of the underlying dynamics and is robust to noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anastasis Kratsios, Giulia Livieri, A. Martina Neuman</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the statistical behaviour of reasoning probes in a stylized model of looped reasoning, given by Boolean circuits whose computational graph is a perfect $\nu$-ary tree ($\nu\ge 2$) and whose output is appended to the input and fed back iteratively for subsequent computation rounds. A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $\nu$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\mathtt{m}$ admissible $\nu$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.
  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(2/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$, for $\delta\in (0,1)$. Our analysis combines snowflake metric embedding techniques with tools from statistical optimal transport. A key insight is that this optimal rate is achievable independently of graph size, owing to the existence of a low-distortion one-dimensional snowflake embedding of the induced graph metric. As a consequence, our results provide a sharp characterization of how structural properties of the computational graph govern the statistical efficiency of reasoning under partial access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kapilan Balagopalan, Yinan Li, Yao Zhao, Tuan Nguyen, Anton Daitche, Houssam Nassif, Kwang-Sung Jun</p>
<p>Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zidi Xiong, Shan Chen, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are increasingly deployed, auditing their chain-of-thought (CoT) traces for safety becomes critical. Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a "free gift" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Yazdnian, Yasaman Ghasempour</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication and sensing. Yet, today's learning-based wireless techniques do not generalize well: most models are task-specific, environment-dependent, and limited to narrow sensing modalities, requiring costly retraining when deployed in new scenarios. This work introduces a task-agnostic, multi-modal foundational model for physical-layer wireless systems that learns transferable, physics-aware representations across heterogeneous modalities, enabling robust generalization across tasks and environments. Our framework employs a physics-guided self-supervised pretraining strategy incorporating a dedicated physical token to capture cross-modal physical correspondences governed by electromagnetic propagation. The learned representations enable efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks, including massive multi-antenna optimization, wireless channel estimation, and device localization, using limited labeled data. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate superior generalization, robustness to deployment shifts, and reduced data requirements compared to task-specific baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leila Amgoud, Martin Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.
  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Kothapalli, Rishabh Ranjan, Valter Hudovernik, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Johannes Hoffart, Carlos Guestrin, Jure Leskovec</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational Foundation Models (RFMs) facilitate data-driven decision-making by learning from complex multi-table databases. However, the diverse relational databases needed to train such models are rarely public due to privacy constraints. While there are methods to generate synthetic tabular data of arbitrary size, incorporating schema structure and primary--foreign key connectivity for multi-table generation remains challenging. Here we introduce PluRel, a framework to synthesize multi-tabular relational databases from scratch. In a step-by-step fashion, PluRel models (1) schemas with directed graphs, (2) inter-table primary-foreign key connectivity with bipartite graphs, and, (3) feature distributions in tables via conditional causal mechanisms. The design space across these stages supports the synthesis of a wide range of diverse databases, while being computationally lightweight. Using PluRel, we observe for the first time that (1) RFM pretraining loss exhibits power-law scaling with the number of synthetic databases and total pretraining tokens, (2) scaling the number of synthetic databases improves generalization to real databases, and (3) synthetic pretraining yields strong base models for continued pretraining on real databases. Overall, our framework and results position synthetic data scaling as a promising paradigm for RFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jane Schlesinger, Simon Hjaltason, Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models have recently emerged to predict whether hypothetical solid-state materials can be synthesized. These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongming Xie, Joseph Giorgio, Jingshen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying and making statistical inferences on differential treatment effects (commonly known as subgroup analysis in clinical research) is central to precision health. Subgroup analysis allows practitioners to pinpoint populations for whom a treatment is especially beneficial or protective, thereby advancing targeted interventions. Tree based recursive partitioning methods are widely used for subgroup analysis due to their interpretability. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter significant limitations, including suboptimal partitions induced by greedy heuristics and overfitting from locally estimated splits, especially under limited sample sizes. To address these limitations, we propose a fused optimal causal tree method that leverages mixed integer optimization (MIO) to facilitate precise subgroup identification. Our approach ensures globally optimal partitions and introduces a parameter fusion constraint to facilitate information sharing across related subgroups. This design substantially improves subgroup discovery accuracy and enhances statistical efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees by rigorously establishing out of sample risk bounds and comparing them with those of classical tree based methods. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms popular baselines in simulations. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility through a case study on the Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS-HD) dataset, where our approach yields clinically meaningful insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Lin, Sirou Zhu, Yilei Chen, Mingyu Chen, Hejian Sang, Ioannis Paschalidis, Zhipeng Wang, Aldo Pacchiano, Xuezhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingwen Zhang, Wenjia Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern systems, such as digital platforms and service systems, increasingly rely on contextual bandits for online decision-making; however, their deployment can inadvertently create unfair exposure among arms, undermining long-term platform sustainability and supplier trust. This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-\delta)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal "price of fairness". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

<p>Abstract: Data incompleteness severely impedes the reliability of multimodal systems. Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \textbf{\underline{O}}mni-\textbf{\underline{M}}odality \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\% missing rates.</p>

This game-theoretic perspective reveals that existing robust optimization methods such as minimizing worst-group loss or regret correspond to classical bargaining solutions and embody different fairness principles. We propose relative improvement, the ratio of actual risk reduction to potential reduction from a baseline predictor, which recovers the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. Unlike absolute-scale methods that may not be comparable when groups have different potential predictability, relative improvement provides axiomatic justification including scale invariance and individual monotonicity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Zhao, Ryan Marcus</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-level database operators often admit multiple physical implementations ("kernels") that are semantically equivalent but have vastly different performance characteristics depending on the input data distribution. Existing database systems typically rely on static heuristics or worst-case optimal defaults to select these kernels, often missing significant performance opportunities. In this work, we propose CAKE (Counterfactual Adaptive Kernel Execution), a system that learns to select the optimal kernel for each data "morsel" using a microsecond-scale contextual multi-armed bandit. CAKE circumvents the high latency of traditional reinforcement learning by exploiting the cheapness of counterfactuals -- selectively running multiple kernels to obtain full feedback -- and compiling policies into low-latency regret trees. Experimentally, we show that CAKE can reduce end-to-end workload latency by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art static heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angel Martinez-Sanchez, Parthib Roy, Ross Greer</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhexin Zhang, Yida Lu, Junfeng Fang, Junxiao Yang, Shiyao Cui, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Li, Rui Zhang, Siyuan Huang, Xian Zhong, Hongbo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonbeom Choi, Daechul Ahn, Youhan Lee, Taewook Kang, Seongwon Cho, Jonghyun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enyu Zhou, Zhiheng Xi, Long Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Shihan Dou, Zhikai Lei, Guoteng Wang, Rui Zheng, Hang Yan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqi Liu, Xiaoshen Han, Jiawei Gao, Yue Zhao, Haonan Chen, Yilun Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained models have become indispensable for efficiently building models across a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. The advantages of pre-trained models have been highlighted by empirical studies on scaling laws, which demonstrate that larger pre-trained models can significantly reduce the sample complexity of downstream learning. However, existing theoretical investigations of pre-trained models lack the capability to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a theoretical investigation by introducing a novel framework, caulking, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as adapter-based fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and partial fine-tuning. Our analysis establishes that improved pre-trained models provably decrease the sample complexity of downstream tasks, thereby offering theoretical justification for the empirically observed scaling laws relating pre-trained model size to downstream performance, a relationship not covered by existing results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suzeyu Chen, Leheng Li, Ying-Cong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaze Wang, Qinghao Zhao, Zizheng Chen, Zhejun Sun, Deyun Zhang, Yuxi Zhou, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional diagnosis of aortic valve disease relies on echocardiography, but its cost and required expertise limit its use in large-scale early screening. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiwen Jiang, Takuo Matsubara, Minh-Ngoc Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: The Importance-Weighted Evidence Lower Bound (IW-ELBO) has emerged as an effective objective for variational inference (VI), tightening the standard ELBO and mitigating the mode-seeking behaviour.
  However, optimizing the IW-ELBO in Euclidean space is often inefficient, as its gradient estimators suffer from a vanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper formulates the optimisation of the IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space, a manifold of Gaussian distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. We derive the Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO and project it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space to yield a tractable algorithm for Gaussian VI.
  A pivotal contribution of our analysis concerns the stability of the gradient estimator. While the SNR of the standard Euclidean gradient estimator is known to vanish as the number of importance samples $K$ increases, we prove that the SNR of the Wasserstein gradient scales favourably as $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, ensuring optimisation efficiency even for large $K$. We further extend this geometric analysis to the Variational R\'enyi Importance-Weighted Autoencoder bound, establishing analogous stability guarantees. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior approximation performance compared to other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Ning, Jun Fang, Naiqiang Tan, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Cheng, Xingyu Zhu, Haoyu Zhao, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Zheng, Xinyu Li, Qian Liu, Xiachong Feng, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branislav Pecher, Michal Spiegel, Robert Belanec, Jan Cegin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chien-Chun Wang, Hung-Shin Lee, Hsin-Min Wang, Berlin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech enhancement (SE) have exhibited remarkable capabilities under matched noise and channel conditions. However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ferdinand Genans (SU, LPSM), Olivier Wintenberger (SU, LPSM)</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving large scale Optimal Transport (OT) in machine learning typically relies on sampling measures to obtain a tractable discrete problem. While the discrete solver's accuracy is controllable, the rate of convergence of the discretization error is governed by the intrinsic dimension of our data. Therefore, the true bottleneck is the knowledge and control of the sampling error. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing novel estimators for both sampling error and intrinsic dimension. The key finding is a simple, tuning-free estimator of $\text{OT}_c(\rho, \hat\rho)$ that utilizes the semi-dual OT functional and, remarkably, requires no OT solver. Furthermore, we derive a fast intrinsic dimension estimator from the multi-scale decay of our sampling error estimator. This framework unlocks significant computational and statistical advantages in practice, enabling us to (i) quantify the convergence rate of the discretization error, (ii) calibrate the entropic regularization of Sinkhorn divergences to the data's intrinsic geometry, and (iii) introduce a novel, intrinsic-dimension-based Richardson extrapolation estimator that strongly debiases Wasserstein distance estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our geometry-aware pipeline effectively mitigates the discretization error bottleneck while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, instructional practices in Operations Research (OR), Management Science (MS), and Analytics have increasingly shifted toward digital environments, where large and diverse groups of learners make it difficult to provide practice that adapts to individual needs. This paper introduces a method that generates personalized sequences of exercises by selecting, at each step, the exercise most likely to advance a learner's understanding of a targeted skill. The method uses information about the learner and their past performance to guide these choices, and learning progress is measured as the change in estimated skill level before and after each exercise. Using data from an online mathematics tutoring platform, we find that the approach recommends exercises associated with greater skill improvement and adapts effectively to differences across learners. From an instructional perspective, the framework enables personalized practice at scale, highlights exercises with consistently strong learning value, and helps instructors identify learners who may benefit from additional support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li, Ning Wang, Tongxin Bai, Changwang Mei, Peisong Wang, Shuang Qiu, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

<p>Abstract: Prediction sets provide a means of quantifying the uncertainty in predictive tasks. Using held out calibration data, conformal prediction and risk control can produce prediction sets that exhibit statistically valid error control in a computationally efficient manner. However, in the standard formulations, the error is only controlled on average over many possible calibration datasets of fixed size. In this paper, we extend the control to remain valid with high probability over a cumulatively growing calibration dataset at any time point. We derive such guarantees using quantile-based arguments and illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to settings involving distribution shift.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Annalisa Barbara, Riccardo Poiani, Martino Bernasconi, Andrea Celli</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a setting in which two players play a (possibly approximate) Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game, while a learner observes only their actions and has no knowledge of the equilibrium or the underlying game. A natural question is whether the learner can rationalize the observed behavior by inferring the players' payoff functions. Rather than producing a single payoff estimate, inverse game theory aims to identify the entire set of payoffs consistent with observed behavior, enabling downstream use in, e.g., counterfactual analysis and mechanism design across applications like auctions, pricing, and security games. We focus on the problem of estimating the set of feasible payoffs with high probability and up to precision $\epsilon$ on the Hausdorff metric. We provide the first minimax-optimal rates for both exact and approximate equilibrium play, in zero-sum as well as general-sum games. Our results provide learning-theoretic foundations for set-valued payoff inference in multi-agent environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Rodemann, Unai Fischer-Abaigar, James Bailie, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puyue Wang, Jiawei Hu, Yan Gao, Junyan Wang, Yu Zhang, Gillian Dobbie, Tao Gu, Wafa Johal, Ting Dang, Hong Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ansu Mathew, Ahmer A. B. Baloch, Alamin Yakasai, Hemant Mittal, Vivian Alberts, Jayakumar V. Karunamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction of crystal system from X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra is a critical task in materials science, particularly for perovskite materials which are known for their diverse applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven framework that leverages advanced models, including Time Series Forest (TSF), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a simple feedforward neural network (NN), to classify crystal systems, point groups, and space groups from XRD data of perovskite materials. To address class imbalance and enhance model robustness, we integrated feature augmentation strategies such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), class weighting, jittering, and spectrum shifting, along with efficient data preprocessing pipelines. The TSF model with SMOTE augmentation achieved strong performance for crystal system prediction, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, an F1 score of 0.92, and an accuracy of 97.76%. For point and space group prediction, balanced accuracies above 95% were obtained. The model demonstrated high performance for symmetry-distinct classes, including cubic crystal systems, point groups 3m and m-3m, and space groups Pnma and Pnnn. This work highlights the potential of ML for XRD-based structural characterization and accelerated discovery of perovskite materials</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyi Chen, Anpeng Wu, Bo Li, Lu Deng, Yong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A/B testing on platforms often faces challenges from network interference, where a unit's outcome depends not only on its own treatment but also on the treatments of its network neighbors. To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework. This insight motivates a semi-supervised lens, wherein interior nodes are treated as labeled data subject to selection bias. Extensive and challenging simulation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of our augmented MII estimator across various settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjin Xiang, Zhihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the rank-one spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime, where the noise entries are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, unit variance, and finite fourth moment.This setting extends the classical Gaussian framework to a substantially broader class of noise distributions.Focusing on asymmetric tensors of order $d$ ($\ge 3$), we analyze the maximum likelihood estimator of the best rank-one approximation.Under a mild assumption isolating informative critical points of the associated optimization landscape, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of a suitably defined block-wise tensor contraction converges almost surely to a deterministic limit that coincides with the Gaussian case.As a consequence, the asymptotic singular value and the alignments between the estimated and true spike directions admit explicit characterizations identical to those obtained under Gaussian noise. These results establish a universality principle for spiked tensor models, demonstrating that their high-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits are robust to non-Gaussian noise.
  Our analysis relies on resolvent methods from random matrix theory, cumulant expansions valid under finite moment assumptions, and variance bounds based on Efron-Stein-type arguments. A key challenge in the proof is how to handle the statistical dependence between the signal term and the noise term.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing mechanistic models of neural circuits is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, yet verifying such models is limited by the lack of ground truth. To rigorously test model discovery, we establish an in silico testbed using neuromechanical simulations of a larval zebrafish as a transparent ground truth. We find that LLM-based tree search autonomously discovers predictive models that significantly outperform established forecasting baselines. Conditioning on sensory drive is necessary but not sufficient for faithful system identification, as models exploit statistical shortcuts. Structural priors prove essential for enabling robust out-of-distribution generalization and recovery of interpretable mechanistic models. Our insights provide guidance for modeling real-world neural recordings and offer a broader template for AI-driven scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Holgado-S\'anchez, Holger Billhardt, Alberto Fern\'andez, Sascha Ossowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Agreement Technologies refer to open computer systems in which autonomous software agents interact with one another, typically on behalf of humans, in order to come to mutually acceptable agreements. With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation. In this article, we propose a novel method to automatically \emph{learn} value systems from observations and human demonstrations. In particular, we propose a formal model of the \emph{value system learning} problem, its instantiation to sequential decision-making domains based on multi-objective Markov decision processes, as well as tailored preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to infer value grounding functions and value systems. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by two simulated use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.</p>

<p>Abstract: TabPFN is a transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on supervised tabular tasks by amortizing Bayesian prediction into a single forward pass. However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Wang, Dennis Frauen, Emil Javurek, Konstantin Hess, Yuchen Ma, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) estimates causal effects in panel data with a single-treated unit by constructing a counterfactual outcome as a weighted combination of untreated control units that matches the pre-treatment trajectory. In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates. Across extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, TSC consistently improves estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art SCM baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the paradigm of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) gains prominence, its benefits to society are accompanied by significant ethical concerns, one of which is the protection of individual privacy. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of privacy within HCAI, proposing a human-centered privacy (HCP) framework, providing integrated solution from technology, ethics, and human factors perspectives. The chapter begins by mapping privacy risks across each stage of AI development lifecycle, from data collection to deployment and reuse, highlighting the impact of privacy risks on the entire system. The chapter then introduces privacy-preserving techniques such as federated learning and dif erential privacy. Subsequent chapters integrate the crucial user perspective by examining mental models, alongside the evolving regulatory and ethical landscapes as well as privacy governance. Next, advice on design guidelines is provided based on the human-centered privacy framework. After that, we introduce practical case studies across diverse fields. Finally, the chapter discusses persistent open challenges and future research directions, concluding that a multidisciplinary approach, merging technical, design, policy, and ethical expertise, is essential to successfully embed privacy into the core of HCAI, thereby ensuring these technologies advance in a manner that respects and ensures human autonomy, trust and dignity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Rodrigez, Alejandro Lancho, Amir Weiss</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasingly crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum forces communication signals to coexist, creating heterogeneous interferers whose structure often departs from Gaussian models. Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Fogel, Omer Hofman, Eilon Cohen, Roman Vainshtein</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-weight language models are increasingly used in production settings, raising new security challenges. One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Root-cause analysis in controlled time dependent systems poses a major challenge in applications. Especially energy systems are difficult to handle as they exhibit instantaneous as well as delayed effects and if equipped with storage, do have a memory. In this paper we adapt the causal root-cause analysis method of Budhathoki et al.

Particularly, we discuss two truncation approaches to handle the infinite dependency graphs present in time-dependent systems. While one leaves the causal mechanisms intact, the other approximates the mechanisms at the start nodes. The effectiveness of the different approaches is benchmarked using a challenging data generation process inspired by a problem in factory energy management: the avoidance of peaks in the power consumption. We show that given enough lags our extension is able to localize the root-causes in the feature and time domain. Further the effect of mechanism approximation is discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gordan Prastalo, Kevin Maik Jablonka</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular representations are inherently task-dependent, yet most pre-trained molecular encoders are not. Task conditioning promises representations that reorganize based on task descriptions, but existing approaches rely on expensive labeled data. We show that weak supervision on programmatically derived molecular motifs is sufficient. Our Adaptive Chemical Embedding Model (ACE-Mol) learns from hundreds of motifs paired with natural language descriptors that are cheap to compute, trivial to scale. Conventional encoders slowly search the embedding space for task-relevant structure, whereas ACE-Mol immediately aligns its representations with the task. ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks with interpretable, chemically meaningful representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Tavakolian, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Ahmed Alkhateeb, Markku Juntti</p>
<p>Abstract: Beamforming in millimeter-wave (mmWave) high-mobility environments typically incurs substantial training overhead. While prior studies suggest that sub-6 GHz channels can be exploited to predict optimal mmWave beams, existing methods depend on large deep learning (DL) models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for sub-6 GHz channel-mmWave beam mapping based on the knowledge distillation (KD) technique. We develop two compact student DL architectures based on individual and relational distillation strategies, which retain only a few hidden layers yet closely mimic the performance of large teacher DL models. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed student models achieve the teacher's beam prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency while reducing trainable parameters and computational complexity by 99%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Tardy, Gr\'egoire Lefebvre, Apostolos Kountouris, Ha\"ifa Fares, Amor Nafkha</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a cross-attention Transformer for joint decoding of uplink OFDM signals received by multiple coordinated access points. A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameh Khattab, Jean-Philippe Corbeil, Osman Alperen Kora\c{s}, Amin Dada, Julian Friedrich, Fran\c{c}ois Beaulieu, Paul Vozila, Jens Kleesiek</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thatchanon Anancharoenkij, Donlapark Ponnoprat</p>
<p>Abstract: A complete understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects involves characterizing the full conditional distribution of potential outcomes. To this end, we propose the Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME), a framework that embeds conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Under this framework, we develop a two-stage meta-estimator for CCME that accommodates any RKHS-valued regression in each stage. Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network. We provide finite-sample convergence rates for all estimators, establishing that they possess the double robustness property. Our experiments demonstrate that our estimators accurately recover distributional features including multimodal structure of conditional counterfactual distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blake Bordelon, Francesco Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $\eta_T^\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $\eta_T^\star(t) \simeq T^{-\xi} (1-t/T)^{\delta}$ where $\xi$ and $\delta$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $\beta(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $\eta_T(t) \sim T^{-\xi}$ (2) optimal power laws $\eta_T(t) \sim T^{-\xi} t^{-\chi}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these. Our theory suggests that learning rate transfer across training horizon depends on the structure of the model and task. We explore these ideas in simple experimental pretraining setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Yuan, Tailin Jin, Weize Chen, Zeyuan Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aqsa Sultana, Rayan Afsar, Ahmed Rahu, Surendra P. Singh, Brian Shula, Brandon Combs, Derrick Forchetti, Vijayan K. Asari</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzia Hossain, Samanta Ghosh, Shahida Begum, B. M. Shahria Alam, Mohammad Tahmid Noor, Md Parvez Mia, Nishat Tasnim Niloy</p>
<p>Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Barnfield, Subhabrata Sen, Pragya Sur</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip A. LeMaitre, Marius Krumm, Hans J. Briegel</p>
<p>Abstract: With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like generalization, interpretability, and inter-operability with human users. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the high-level strategies underlying rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a *rule generation* step guided by language models, and an *update* step where agents learn new policies guided by rules, even when a rule is insufficient to describe an entire complex policy. Across five diverse tasks, including a two-player signaling game, maze navigation, image reconstruction, and robot grasp planning, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination.

<p>Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals that are simultaneously valid across a class of estimates is central to tasks such as multiple mean estimation, generalization guarantees, and adaptive experimental design. We frame this as an ``error estimation problem," where the goal is to determine a high-probability upper bound on the maximum error for a class of estimates. We propose an entirely data-driven approach that derives such bounds for both finite and infinite class settings, naturally adapting to a potentially unknown correlation structure of random errors. Notably, our method does not require class complexity as an input, overcoming a major limitation of existing approaches. We present our simple yet general solution and demonstrate applications to simultaneous confidence intervals, excess-risk control and optimizing exploration in contextual bandit algorithms.</p>

Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field or potential around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves relative error of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g.~physics simulations. We compare with existing models and develop two-dimensional examples, including cases where sources overlap or have more complex geometries, to demonstrate its application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Target-group detection is the task of detecting which group(s) a piece of content is ``directed at or about''. Applications include targeted marketing, content recommendation, and group-specific content assessment. Key challenges include: 1) that a single post may target multiple groups; and 2) ensuring consistent detection accuracy across groups for fairness. In this work, we investigate fairness implications of target-group detection in the context of toxicity detection, where the perceived harm of a social media post often depends on which group(s) it targets. Because toxicity is highly contextual, language that appears benign in general can be harmful when targeting specific demographic groups. We show our {\em fairness-aware multi-group target detection} approach both reduces bias across groups and shows strong predictive performance, surpassing existing fairness-aware baselines. To enable reproducibility and spur future work, we share our code online.</p>

<p>Abstract: In interactive task learning (ITL), AI agents learn new capabilities from limited human instruction provided during task execution. STAND is a new method of data-efficient rule precondition induction specifically designed for these human-in-the-loop training scenarios. A key feature of STAND is its self-awareness of its own learning -- it can provide accurate metrics of training progress back to users. STAND beats popular methods like XGBoost, decision trees, random forests, and version spaces at small-data precondition induction tasks, and is highly accurate at estimating when its performance improves on holdout examples. In our evaluations, we find that STAND shows more monotonic improvement than other models with low rates of error recurrence. These features of STAND support a more consistent training experience, enabling human instructors to estimate when they are finished training and providing active-learning support by identifying trouble spots where more training is required.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pure exploration in bandits formalises multiple real-world problems, such as tuning hyper-parameters or conducting user studies to test a set of items, where different safety, resource, and fairness constraints on the decision space naturally appear. We study these problems as pure exploration in multi-armed bandits with unknown linear constraints, where the aim is to identify an $r$-optimal and feasible policy as fast as possible with a given level of confidence. First, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the sample complexity lower bound for pure exploration under constraints. Second, we leverage properties of convex optimisation in the Lagrangian lower bound to propose two computationally efficient extensions of Track-and-Stop and Gamified Explorer, namely LATS and LAGEX. Then, we propose a constraint-adaptive stopping rule, and while tracking the lower bound, use optimistic estimate of the feasible set at each step. We show that LAGEX achieves asymptotically optimal sample complexity upper bound, while LATS shows asymptotic optimality up to novel constraint-dependent constants. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with different reward distributions and constraints that validate efficient performance of LATS and LAGEX.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinye Chen, Erin Carson, Cheng Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to avoid obvious drifting during forecasting tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive forecasting capability compared to recent SOTA time series forecasting results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibakar Roy Sarkar, Vijay Kag, Birupaksha Pal, Somdatta Goswami</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering hidden physical laws and identifying governing system parameters from sparse observations are central challenges in computational science and engineering. Existing data-driven methods, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and sparse regression, are limited by their need for extensive retraining, sensitivity to noise, or inability to generalize across families of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we introduce two complementary frameworks based on deep operator networks (DeepONet) to address these limitations. The first, termed the Deep Hidden Physics Operator (DHPO), extends hidden-physics modeling into the operator-learning paradigm, enabling the discovery of unknown PDE terms across diverse equation families by identifying the mapping of unknown physical operators. The second is a parameter identification framework that combines pretrained DeepONet with physics-informed inverse modeling to infer system parameters directly from sparse sensor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches on benchmark problems, including the Reaction-Diffusion system, Burgers' equation, the 2D Heat equation, and 2D Helmholtz equation. Across all cases, the proposed methods achieve high accuracy, with relative solution errors on the order of O(10^-2) and parameter estimation errors on the order of O(10^-3), even under limited and noisy observations. By uniting operator learning with physics-informed modeling, this work offers a unified and data-efficient framework for physics discovery and parameter identification, paving the way for robust inverse modeling in complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julius Berner, Lorenz Richter, Marcin Sendera, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Nikolay Malkin</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of training neural stochastic differential equations, or diffusion models, to sample from a Boltzmann distribution without access to target samples. Existing methods for training such models enforce time-reversal of the generative and noising processes, using either differentiable simulation or off-policy reinforcement learning (RL). We prove equivalences between families of objectives in the limit of infinitesimal discretization steps, linking entropic RL methods (GFlowNets) with continuous-time objects (partial differential equations and path space measures). We further show that an appropriate choice of coarse time discretization during training allows greatly improved sample efficiency and the use of time-local objectives, achieving competitive performance on standard sampling benchmarks with reduced computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Kumar, Jaechul Roh, Ali Naseh, Marzena Karpinska, Mohit Iyyer, Amir Houmansadr, Eugene Bagdasarian</p>
<p>Abstract: Most flagship language models generate explicit reasoning chains, enabling inference-time scaling. However, producing these reasoning chains increases token usage (i.e., reasoning tokens), which in turn increases latency and costs. Our OverThink attack increases overhead for applications that rely on reasoning language models (RLMs) and external context by forcing them to spend substantially more reasoning tokens while still producing contextually correct answers. An adversary mounts an attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into public content that is consumed by RLM at inference time. Because our decoys (e.g., Markov decision processes, Sudokus, etc.) are benign, they evade safety filters. We evaluate OverThink on both closed-source and open-source reasoning models across the FreshQA, SQuAD, and MuSR datasets. We also explore the attack in multi-modal settings by creating images that cause excessive reasoning. We show that the resulting slowdown transfers across models. Finally, we explore both LLM-based and systems-level defenses, and discuss the societal, financial, and energy implications of the OverThink attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyan Chen, Yile Li, Da Long, Zhitong Xu, Wei Xing, Jacob Hochhalter, Shandian Zhe</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural operators have shown great potential in surrogate modeling. However, training a well-performing neural operator typically requires a substantial amount of data, which can pose a major challenge in complex applications. In such scenarios, detailed physical knowledge can be unavailable or difficult to obtain, and collecting extensive data is often prohibitively expensive. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pseudo Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PPI-NO) framework. PPI-NO constructs a surrogate physics system for the target system using partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from simple, rudimentary physics principles, such as basic differential operators. This surrogate system is coupled with a neural operator model, using an alternating update and learning process to iteratively enhance the model's predictive power. While the physics derived via PPI-NO may not mirror the ground-truth underlying physical laws -- hence the term ``pseudo physics'' -- this approach significantly improves the accuracy of standard operator learning models in data-scarce scenarios, which is evidenced by extensive evaluations across five benchmark tasks and a fatigue modeling application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxun Ma, Toru Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Route choice models are one of the most important foundations for transportation research. Traditionally, theory-based models have been utilized for their great interpretability, such as logit models and Recursive logit models. More recently, machine learning approaches have gained attentions for their better prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose novel hybrid models that integrate the Recursive logit model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability. To the authors' knowldedge, GNNs have not been utilized for route choice modeling, despite their proven effectiveness in capturing road network features and their widespread use in other transportation research areas. We mathematically show that our use of GNN is not only beneficial for enhancing the prediction performance, but also relaxing the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives property without relying on strong assumptions. This is due to the fact that a specific type of GNN can efficiently capture multiple cross-effect patterns on networks from data. By applying the proposed models to one-day travel trajectory data in Tokyo, we confirmed their higher prediction accuracy compared to the existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian-Rong Zhang, Yue-Jiao Gong, Yuan-Ting Zhong, Ting Huang, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingchan Bao, Tong Wei, Yuanyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit multi-agent asynchronous online optimization with delays, where only one of the agents becomes active for making the decision at each round, and the corresponding feedback is received by all the agents after unknown delays. Although previous studies have established an $O(\sqrt{dT})$ regret bound for this problem, they assume that the maximum delay $d$ is knowable or the arrival order of feedback satisfies a special property, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we surprisingly find that when the loss functions are strongly convex, these assumptions can be eliminated, and the existing regret bound can be significantly improved to $O(d\log T)$ meanwhile. Specifically, to exploit the strong convexity of functions, we first propose a delayed variant of the classical follow-the-leader algorithm, namely FTDL, which is very simple but requires the full information of functions as feedback. Moreover, to handle the more general case with only the gradient feedback, we develop an approximate variant of FTDL by combining it with surrogate loss functions. Experimental results show that the approximate FTDL outperforms the existing algorithm in the strongly convex case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ren-Wei Liang, Chin-Ting Hsu, Chan-Hung Yu, Saransh Agrawal, Shih-Cheng Huang, Chieh-Yen Lin, Shang-Tse Chen, Kuan-Hao Huang, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless is a critical challenge, as overly strict constraints can lead to excessive refusals, while permissive models risk generating harmful content. Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), attempt to balance these trade-offs but suffer from performance conflicts, limited controllability, and poor extendability. To address these issues, we propose Preference Vector, a novel framework inspired by task arithmetic. Instead of optimizing multiple preferences within a single objective, we train separate models on individual preferences, extract behavior shifts as preference vectors, and dynamically merge them at test time. This modular approach enables fine-grained, user-controllable preference adjustments and facilitates seamless integration of new preferences without retraining. Experiments show that our proposed Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, allows smooth control over preference trade-offs, and supports scalable multi-preference alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In\^es Cardoso Oliveira, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Luis A. Leiva</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful type of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image synthesis tasks and have shown potential in other domains, such as natural language processing and temporal data modeling. Despite their stable training dynamics and ability to produce diverse high-quality samples, DMs are notorious for requiring significant computational resources, both in the training and inference stages. Previous work has focused mostly on increasing the efficiency of model inference. This paper introduces, for the first time, the paradigm of sparse-to-sparse training to DMs, with the aim of improving both training and inference efficiency. We focus on unconditional generation and train sparse DMs from scratch (Latent Diffusion and ChiroDiff) on six datasets using three different methods (Static-DM, RigL-DM, and MagRan-DM) to study the effect of sparsity in model performance. Our experiments show that sparse DMs are able to match and often outperform their Dense counterparts, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs. We also identify safe and effective values to perform sparse-to-sparse training of DMs.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13697">RL in Name Only? Analyzing the Structural Assumptions in RL post-training for LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Rani Samineni, Durgesh Kalwar, Karthik Valmeekam, Kaya Stechly, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing claims around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as an MDP, and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP, that characterizes the problem as a contextual bandit, where RL updates naturally collapse into a form of on-policy variant of outcome-driven supervised learning. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that, due to these simplifying assumptions, GRPO objective reduces to filtered Iterative SFT, an on-policy variant of supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown, across a diverse set of model families show that Filtered Iterative SFT, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We also show that these structural assumptions indirectly incentivize RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL incentivizing thinking because it generates longer thinking traces."</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18088">Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Giuseppe Di Francesco, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Franco Maria Nardini, Raffaele Perego, Nicola Tonellotto, Fabrizio Silvestri</p>
<p>Abstract: Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to stop inference once prediction confidence is high, reducing latency and energy on easy inputs while retaining full-depth accuracy on harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder ones to capture intricate relationships. Yet, their potential in deep GNNs, where over-smoothing, over-squashing or more generally vanishing gradients prevent these model to properly learn, remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric GNNs (SAS-GNN), whose symmetry-based inductive biases yield stable intermediate representations that support safe early exits. Building on this backbone, we propose Early-Exit GNNs (EEGNNs), which attach confidence-aware exit neural heads which are trainable end-to-end based on the task objective, enabling on-the-fly termination at node or graph level. Experiments show that EEGNNs learn task-driven exit strategies, while achieving competitive results on heterophilic graphs and long-range tasks. Even when not outperforming the strongest baselines, EEGNNs consistently deliver favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs thanks to their adaptive and parameter-efficient design. We plan to release the code to reproduce our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farshad Noravesh, Reza Haffari, Layki Soon, Arghya Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Attention Networks (GATs) have emerged as powerful models for learning expressive representations from such data by adaptively weighting neighboring nodes through attention mechanisms. However, most existing approaches primarily rely on node attributes and direct neighborhood connections, often overlooking rich structural patterns that capture higher-order topological information crucial for many real-world datasets. In this work, we present the Graph Structure Attention Network (GSAT), a novel extension of GAT that jointly integrates attribute-based and structure-based representations for more effective graph learning. GSAT incorporates structural features derived from anonymous random walks (ARWs) and graph kernels to encode local topological information, enabling attention mechanisms to adapt based on the underlying graph structure. This design enhances the model's ability to discern meaningful relational dependencies within complex data. Comprehensive experiments on standard graph classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that GSAT achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art graph learning methods, highlighting the value of incorporating structural context for representation learning on graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Annabelle Sujun Tang, Christopher Priebe, Rohan Mahapatra, Lianhui Qin, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating a structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Chun Liao, Chieh-Lin Tsai, Yuan-Hao Chang, Cam\'elia Slimani, Jalil Boukhobza, Tei-Wei Kuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capability in learning from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM) offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation. Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that implementing the tree mapping scheme alone reduces CAM capacity requirement by $1.46\times$ to $21.30 \times$, while the full RETENTION framework achieves $4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ reduction with less than 3\% accuracy loss. These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in minimizing CAM resource demand, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based model acceleration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than PH and spectral information on graphs alone. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnaud Fickinger, Abderrahim Bendahi, Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement-learning (RL) agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR), which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely unexplored. In this work, we cast ODR as a maximum-likelihood estimation over a parametric simulator family and provide statistical guarantees: under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, the estimator is weakly consistent (it converges in probability to the true dynamics as data grows), and it becomes strongly consistent (i.e., it converges almost surely to the true dynamics) when an additional uniform Lipschitz continuity assumption holds. We examine the practicality of these assumptions and outline relaxations that justify ODR's applicability across a broader range of settings. Taken together, our results place ODR on a principled footing and clarify when offline data can soundly guide the choice of a randomization distribution for downstream offline RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehul Bafna, Siddhant anand Jadhav, David Sweet</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black-box problems where function evaluation is expensive and, therefore, observations are few. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where function evaluation is cheaper and observations are more plentiful. In this regime, scaling to many observations $N$ is impeded by Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates: GP hyperparameter fitting scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ (reduced to roughly $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in modern implementations), and it is repeated at every BO iteration. Many methods improve scaling at acquisition time, but hyperparameter fitting still scales poorly, making it the bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a lightweight alternative to GPs that estimates function values and uncertainty (epistemic and aleatoric) from $K$-nearest-neighbor observations. ENN scales as $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for both fitting and acquisition. Our BO method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson-sampling acquisition with $\mathrm{UCB} = \mu(x) + \sigma(x)$. For the special case of noise-free problems, we can omit fitting altogether by replacing $\mathrm{UCB}$ with a non-dominated sort over $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$. We show empirically that TuRBO-ENN reduces proposal time (i.e., fitting time + acquisition time) by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TuRBO at up to 50,000 observations.</p>

We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to the elastic net, hierarchical lasso, and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Meng, Yadan Luo, Liangyu Huo, Yingjian Li, Yaowei Wang, Xin Li, Zheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear attention mitigates the quadratic complexity of softmax attention but suffers from a critical loss of expressiveness. We identify two primary causes: (1) The normalization operation cancels the query norm, which breaks the correlation between a query's norm and the spikiness (entropy) of the attention distribution as in softmax attention. (2) Standard techniques for enforcing non-negativity cause destructive information loss by nullifying valid inner-product interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce NaLaFormer, a novel linear attention mechanism built upon a norm$\times$direction (ND) decomposition of the query and key vectors. We leverage each component to solve a distinct problem: The query norm is injected into our kernel to create a query-norm-aware map that restores the attention distribution's spikiness. The direction vectors are processed by a geometric, cosine-based similarity metric that guarantees non-negativity while preserving the rich, fine-grained information of the inner product. We validate NaLaFormer through a comprehensive multi-modal evaluation, where it sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks for linear attention. Our model achieves up to a 7.5% accuracy gain on ImageNet-1K and a 4.7% mIoU improvement on ADE20K over comparable baselines. It demonstrates profound efficiency, reducing peak memory by a transformative 92.3% in token-intensive super-resolution tasks (70K+ tokens). NaLaFormer's versatility is further confirmed as it surpasses strong baselines like Mamba on common-sense reasoning and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Kumar Panda, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples; however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate. Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI), man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Wang, Xingyu Xu, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bogdan Kulynych, Juan Felipe Gomez, Georgios Kaissis, Jamie Hayes, Borja Balle, Flavio P. Calmon, Jean Louis Raisaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berkant Turan, Suhrab Asadulla, David Steinmann, Kristian Kersting, Wolfgang Stammer, Sebastian Pokutta</p>
<p>Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, expressive concept encodings effectively allow to translate such data into interpretable concepts but are often utilised in the context of low-capacity linear predictors. In this work, we push towards real-world verifiability by combining the strengths of both approaches. We introduce Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified framework combining PVGs for formal verifiability with concept encodings to handle complex, high-dimensional inputs in an interpretable way. NCV achieves this by utilizing recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these encodings, which a verifier, implemented as a nonlinear predictor, uses exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms classic concept-based models and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex datasets and helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV as a promising step toward concept-level, verifiable AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Zhou, Shujian Zhang, Brice Magdalou, John Lambert, Ehsan Amid, Richard Nock, Andrew Hard</p>
<p>Abstract: Normative theories allow one to elicit key parts of a ML algorithm from first principles, which is crucial at a time of championed scrutiny for ML work. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) cleverly bypasses reward modeling by making an explicit link with a specific normative model of human choice. Our paper elevates this connection to the full generality of DPO's normative framework. Getting there requires reworking human choice theory's textbook path for a better RLHF/ML fit. It elevates the connection to a remarkably broad viewpoint on preference optimization, considering the current panorama of DPO follow-ups. It also unveils unexpected riches for ML, chief among which the support for non-convex losses, the fact that any compliant ML analytical choice can be embedded with any human choice model, and a normative framework's umbrella wide enough to safeguard DPO's extensions (margins, length correction, ...). A toy experiment ``far away'' from the DPO crowd is given.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple ``futures'' may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation. We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying MCL to language modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. We illustrate the proposed approach using mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with experiments on visual and audio captioning, as well as machine translation, that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs. The accompanying code and a general-purpose package for applying LoRA-MCL to a wide range of language models are made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Ximing Lu, Mingjie Liu, Yi Dong, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing LLMs' capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows, thereby improving precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the limits of RLVR. We examine how RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves \texttt{pass@1}, \textit{the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets}, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, it results in greater uncertainty at each generation step and declining answer-level entropy. This indicates that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, we reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash requires future innovations that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for solver operators for various functional problems, yet their stability, generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present a systematic effective field theory analysis of FNOs in an infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high frequency modes that are otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this frequency transfer. For wide networks, we derive explicit criticality conditions on the weight initialization ensemble that ensure small input perturbations maintain a uniform scale across depth, and we confirm experimentally that the theoretically predicted ratio of kernel perturbations matches the measurements. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for hyperparameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning in FNOs. Finally, we translate the criticality theory into a practical criterion-matched initialization (calibration) procedure; on a standard PDEBench Burgers benchmark, the calibrated FNO exhibits markedly more stable optimization, faster convergence, and improved test error relative to a vanilla FNO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pallabee Das, Stefan Heindorf</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce universal neural likelihood inference (UNLI): enabling a single model to provide data-grounded, conditional likelihood predictions for arbitrary targets given any collection of observed features, across diverse domains and tasks. To achieve UNLI over heterogeneous tabular data, we develop the Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant Reasoning Engine (ASPIRE) model. Our design addresses critical gaps in existing approaches to merge semantic-understanding capabilities and generalised numerical feature reasoning within a zero-shot capable framework. Trained on over 1,400 real diverse datasets spanning various domains, ASPIRE achieves 15\% higher F1 scores and 85\% lower RMSE than existing tabular foundation models in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Lastly, this work introduces open-world active feature acquisition, where we leverage the UNLI capabilities of ASPIRE to adeptly determine next feature-values to observe to improve inference time prediction accuracies.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654">Input-Time Scaling: Adding Noise and Irrelevance into Less-Is-More Drastically Improves Reasoning Performance and Efficiency</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapheal Huang (Yuming), Weilong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, traditionally requiring high-quality large-scale data and extensive training. Recent works reveal a very appealing Less-Is-More phenomenon where very small, carefully curated high-quality datasets match resource-intensive approaches. In this work, we further systematically relax their quality constraints by adding controlled noise via persona context relevance and comparing datasets of different qualities. Counterintuitively, we find that mixing relevant and irrelevant contexts consistently across training and inference stages yields optimal results -- a phenomenon we term training-testing co-design. Dataset quality comparisons show that high-quality data benefits weaker models on easy questions, while low-quality data achieves higher scores on hard questions with capable models. Across our experiments, reasoning performance is linked to reasoning efficiency. We, for the first time, found adding noisy and irrelevant contexts into queries can improve reasoning efficiency without any prices and targeted designs. Building on these insights, we propose Input-Time Scaling: applying small, low-quality data to capable models with training-testing co-design. This maintains Less-Is-More while further removing labor-intensive quality curation and improving reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, making the approach more applicable and affordable. Our method achieves 76.7% pass@1 on AIME24/25 using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and 90.0%/80.0% with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B -- state-of-the-art among Qwen2.5-32B variants. We are open-sourcing our datasets, pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Han, Linara Adilova, Henning Petzka, Jens Kleesiek, Michael Kamp</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural collapse, i.e., the emergence of highly symmetric, class-wise clustered representations, is frequently observed in deep networks and is often assumed to reflect or enable generalization. In parallel, flatness of the loss landscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet, the causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites for generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle these questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization precedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from training dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative flatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently predicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing generalize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions exhibit delayed generalization, resembling grokking, even in architectures and datasets where it does not typically occur. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural collapse leads to relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining their empirical co-occurrence. Our results support the view that relative flatness is a potentially necessary and more fundamental property for generalization, and demonstrate how grokking can serve as a powerful probe for isolating its geometric underpinnings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Wu, Jianxin Jin, Wanghui Qiu, Peng Chen, Yang Shu, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Cross-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corresponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on 5 well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench, ProbTS, TFB, and EPF, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p>

Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Moeini, Minjae Kwon, Alper Kamil Bozkurt, Yuichi Motai, Rohan Chandra, Lu Feng, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where an agent, after pretraining, can adapt to out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates, instead relying on an expanding context of interaction history. While ICRL has shown impressive generalization, safety during this adaptation process remains unexplored, limiting its applicability in real-world deployments where test-time behavior is expected to be safe. In this work, we propose SCARED: Safe Contextual Adaptive Reinforcement via Exact-penalty Dual, the first method that promotes safe adaptation of ICRL under the constrained Markov decision process framework. During the parameter-update-free adaptation process, our agent not only maximizes the reward but also keeps the accumulated cost within a user-specified safety budget. We also demonstrate that the agent actively reacts to the safety budget; with a higher safety budget, the agent behaves more aggressively, and with a lower safety budget the agent behaves more conservatively. Across challenging benchmarks, SCARED consistently enables safe and robust in-context adaptation, outperforming existing ICRL and safe meta-RL baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is the problem of generalizing from several distributions (or domains), for which labeled training data are available, to a new test domain for which no labeled data is available. For the prevailing benchmark datasets in DG, there exists a single classifier that performs well across all domains.
  In this work, we study a fundamentally different regime where the domains satisfy a \emph{posterior drift} assumption, in which the optimal classifier might vary substantially with domain. We establish a decision-theoretic framework for DG under posterior drift, and investigate the practical implications of this framework through experiments on language and vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Caprio, Siu Lun Chau, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem, and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David L\"udke, Marten Lienen, Marcel Kollovieh, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling. Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07473">metabeta -- A fast neural model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Kipnis, Marcel Binz, Eric Schulz</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression. Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually required time, enabling new use cases for Bayesian mixed-effects modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Tong, Chunlin Gong, Yimeng Gu, Haichao Shi, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Xiao-Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online fake news profoundly distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social platforms. While existing detectors achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets, they remain notably vulnerable to malicious comments designed specifically to induce misclassification. This evolving threat landscape necessitates detection systems that simultaneously prioritize predictive accuracy and structural robustness. However, current detectors often fail to generalize across diverse and novel comment attack patterns. To bridge this gap, we propose AdComment, an adaptive adversarial training framework for robustness enhancement against diverse malicious comments. Based on cognitive psychology, we categorize adversarial comments into Fact Distortion, Logical Confusion, and Emotional Manipulation, and leverage LLMs to synthesize diverse, category-specific perturbations. Central to our framework is an InfoDirichlet Resampling (IDR) mechanism that dynamically adjusts malicious comment proportions during training, thereby steering optimization toward the model's most susceptible regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, improving the F1 scores by 17.9%, 14.5% and 9.0%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arip Asadulaev, Semyon Semenov, Abduragim Shtanchaev, Eric Moulines, Fakhri Karray, Martin Takac</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models typically induce \emph{V-shaped} flows: each sample travels independently along a nearly straight trajectory from the prior to the data. Although effective, this independent movement overlooks the hierarchical structures that exist in real-world data. To address this, we introduce \emph{Y-shaped generative flows}, a framework in which samples travel together along shared pathways before branching off to target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is theoretically justified, yet remains practical, requiring only minimal modifications to standard velocity-driven models. We implement this through a scalable, neural network-based training objective. Experiments on synthetic, image, and biological datasets demonstrate that our method recovers hierarchy-aware structures, improves distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reaches targets in fewer steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyuan Cheng, Wenxuan Yuan, Yiming Yang, Yuanzhao Zhang, Sibo Cheng, Yi He, Zhuo Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anupam Nayak, Tong Yang, Osman Yagan, Gauri Joshi, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization). Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study both two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games: for matrix games, we propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the traditional $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret without the $\beta^{-1}$ dependence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Otte, J\"org K. H. Franke, Arb\"er Zela, F\'abio Ferreira, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of $\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of SR models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11388">Robust inverse material design with physical guarantees using the Voigt-Reuss Net</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanath Keshav, Felix Fritzen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the L\"owner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.</p>

This paper proposes KAN/H, a variant of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that uses a Haar-like hierarchical basis system with nonzero first-order derivatives, instead of B-splines. We also propose a learning-rate scheduling method and a method for handling unbounded real-valued inputs, leveraging properties of linear approximation with Haar-like hierarchical bases. By applying the resulting algorithm to function-approximation problems and MNIST, we confirm that our approach requires minimal problem-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations extracted from tabular foundation models (TabPFN, TabICL and TabSTAR) alongside classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer and a sphere model) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple feature engineering methods achieve comparable or superior performance while requiring significantly less computational resources than tabular foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahrul Ilmi Nasution, Floor Eijkelboom, Mark Elliot, Richard Allmendinger, Christian A. Naesseth</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an important tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06655">GSAE: Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders for Robust LLM Safety Steering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jehyeok Yeon, Federico Cinus, Yifan Wu, Luca Luceri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face critical safety challenges, as they can be manipulated to generate harmful content through adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks. Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embodied assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of positional embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential generation to simultaneously think, listen, and write outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning: it allows models to generate accurate thinking-augmented answers while reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to ${\le}$ 5s and the overall real-time delays by up to $12{\times}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Duan, Jie Lu, En Yu, Junyu Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables coordinated behavior under partial observability by modeling agents as nodes and communication links as edges. While recent methods excel at learning sparse coordination graphs-determining who communicates with whom-they do not address what information should be transmitted under hard bandwidth constraints. We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination. Ablations reveal U-shaped sensitivity to bandwidth, with BVME excelling at extreme ratios while adding minimal overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce sliced ReLU attention, a new attention mechanism that departs structurally from both softmax and its approximation alternatives. Instead of applying a nonlinearity to pairwise dot products, we operate on one-dimensional projections of key--query differences and leverage sorting to obtain quasi-linear complexity. This construction yields a differentiable, non-symmetric kernel that can be computed in O(n log(n)) through a sorting procedure, making it suitable for very long contexts. Beyond computational benefits, the model retains strong theoretical expressive power: we establish two in-context expressivity results, previously known for softmax attention, showing that sliced ReLU attention preserves the ability to perform nontrivial sequence-to-sequence disentangling tasks and satisfies a contextual universal approximation property. Finally, we illustrate the potential practical interest of this kernel in small to medium-scale experiments.</p>

Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling.

<p>Abstract: Unifying the vast heterogeneity of brain signals into a single foundation model is a longstanding challenge in neuroscience. Yet, even as large-scale pretraining becomes feasible, the field lacks principled guidance on how to scale electrophysiological foundation models under realistic data and compute constraints. We present the first systematic scaling law analysis spanning both EEG and iEEG, and uncover a distinct data-constrained characteristic. Unlike language modeling, performance in electrophysiology is dominated first by data scale, followed by training duration (epochs), with model parameter count playing a subordinate role under fixed compute budgets. This challenges the prevailing "bigger is better" heuristic derived from large language models. Building on these insights, we introduce DIVER-1, a family of models trained on the largest and most diverse corpus to date: 59.3k hours (54k EEG and 5.3k iEEG) across 1.6 million channel-hours from more than 17.7k subjects, scaling up to 1.82 billion parameters. By prioritizing data diversity and training horizons over mere parameter expansion, DIVER-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across established benchmarks. Our work provides both a powerful generalist model and actionable guidelines for efficient development of future neuro-AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: PINNs enhance scientific computing by incorporating physical laws into neural network structures, leading to significant advancements in scientific computing. However, PINNs struggle with multi-scale and high-frequency problems due to pathological gradient flow and spectral bias, which severely limit their predictive power. By combining an enhanced network architecture with a dynamically adaptive weighting mechanism featuring upper-bound constraints, we propose the Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN). The proposed method effectively mitigates gradient-related failure modes and overcomes bottlenecks in function representation. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. Numerical results on the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations demonstrate that DBAW-PIKAN achieves superior accuracy and generalization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Manual annotation of spike-wave discharges (SWDs), the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, is labor-intensive for long-term electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring studies. While machine learning approaches show promise for automated detection, they often struggle with cross-subject generalization due to high inter-individual variability in seizure morphology and signal characteristics. In this study we compare the performance of 15 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs and find that a 1D U-Net performs the best. We then improve its performance by employing residual connections and data augmentation strategies combining amplitude scaling, Gaussian noise injection, and signal inversion during training to enhance cross-subject generalization. We also compare our method, named AugUNet1D, to a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks" and show that AugUNet1D performs better on our dataset. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for other users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Liu, Binxuan Huang, Zixuan Zhang, Xin Liu, Bing Yin, Tuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have achieved significant efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens in parallel. However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose BackPlay, a Plug-in framework that enables DLMs to perform autonomous self-correction. BackPlay freezes the parameters of a finetuned DLM to preserve its peak performance while training a specialized correction head added on top of the model. This head is trained specifically on the errors generated by the frozen and well-optimized model, enabling it to capture the model's intrinsic error distribution. To further enhance the head's effectiveness, we introduce Look-back Correction, a training mechanism that empowers the head to leverage current contextual information to supervise and rectify mistakes made in earlier generation steps. During inference, our framework enables the model to jointly generate and revise tokens, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces quality degradation in large-step generation, allowing DLMs to achieve both high speed and strong output fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present EvasionBench, a comprehensive benchmark for detecting evasive responses in corporate earnings call question-and-answer sessions. Drawing from 22.7 million Q&A pairs extracted from S&P Capital IQ transcripts, we construct a rigorously filtered dataset and introduce a three-level evasion taxonomy: direct, intermediate, and fully evasive. Our annotation pipeline employs a Multi-Model Consensus (MMC) framework, combining dual frontier LLM annotation with a three-judge majority voting mechanism for ambiguous cases, achieving a Cohen's Kappa of 0.835 on human inter-annotator agreement. We release: (1) a balanced 84K training set, (2) a 1K gold-standard evaluation set with expert human labels, and (3) [Eva-4B], a 4-billion parameter classifier fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B that achieves 84.9% Macro-F1, outperforming Claude 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3 Flash. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-model consensus labeling over single-model annotation. EvasionBench fills a critical gap in financial NLP by providing the first large-scale benchmark specifically targeting managerial communication evasion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiattikun Chobtham</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting long-term rainfall is challenging. Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for machine learning. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel North East monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Price, Prabhu Vellaisamy, John Shen, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongkun Cui, Nana Zhang, Kun Zhu, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well-being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases, and (2) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42% improvement in AUC, 9.74% in F1 and 39.14% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Young, Srinivasan Keshav</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass density estimation from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LIDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are widely used, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We show that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning architecture that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and exploits geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing estimates to be more uncertain in complex landscapes and less in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from tropical Amazonian forests to boreal, temperate, and alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ni, Weijia Zhang, Fei Wang, Zezhi Shao, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective numerical-visual modality integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tien Dang, The-Hai Nguyen, Dinh Mai Phuong, Nguyen Minh Phuong, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Le-Minh Nguyen, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puyu Wang, Junyu Zhou, Philipp Liznerski, Marius Kloft</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(n\epsilon)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichen Zhao, Zhiming Xue, Yalun Qi, Xianling Zeng, Zihan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saul Santos, Nuno Gon\c{c}alves, Daniel C. McNamee, Marcos Treviso, Andr\'e F. T Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\alpha$-entmax attention with $\alpha = 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \to \infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probing studies what information is encoded in a frozen LLM's layer representations by training a lightweight predictor on top of them. Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Yang, Zhilong Zheng, Shengbo Eben Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of environmental exploration is a critical problem in reinforcement learning (RL). While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have transformed language, vision, and time series data analysis, yet progress on dynamic predictions for physical systems remains limited. Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\underline{LA}rge-\underline{S}cale \underline{S}mall \underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqiang Kang, Yizhe Zhang, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Yi-An Ma, Lianhui Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods improve LLM reasoning by optimizing discrete Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation; however, exploration in token space often suffers from diversity collapse as policy entropy decreases due to mode elicitation behavior in discrete RL. To mitigate this issue, we propose Latent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi-RL), a framework that conducts exploration directly in a continuous latent space, where latent variables encode semantic-level reasoning trajectories. By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting cybersecurity tasks, yet existing approaches struggle with automatic vulnerability discovery and exploitation due to limited interaction, weak execution grounding, and a lack of experience reuse. We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Xin, Tian Lvu, David Keyes, Hatem Ltaief, Marco Canini</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohan Jiang, Dayuan Fu, Junhao Shi, Ji Zeng, Weiye Si, Keyu Li, Xuefeng Li, Yang Xiao, Wenjie Li, Dequan Wang, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scagnetto Arjuna</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics at large scale, directly addressing a critical gap in the literature: the scarcity of large-scale evaluations with operational metrics and protocols that enable meaningful standardization and comparison across studies. We show that identity information is already present in tabular representations (fiducial features): even a simple MLP-based embedding network yields non-trivial performance, establishing a strong baseline before waveform modeling. We then adopt embedding-based deep learning models (ArcFace), first on features and then on ECG waveforms, showing a clear performance jump when moving from tabular inputs to waveforms, and a further gain with larger training sets and consistent normalization across train/val/test. On a large-scale test set, verification achieves high TAR at strict FAR thresholds (TAR=0.908 @ FAR=1e-3; TAR=0.820 @ FAR=1e-4) with EER=2.53\% (all-vs-all); closed-set identification yields Rank@1=0.812 and Rank@10=0.910. In open-set, a two-stage pipeline (top-$K$ shortlist on embeddings + re-ranking) reaches DIR@FAR up to 0.976 at FAR=1e-3 and 1e-4. Overall, the results show that ECG carries a measurable individual signature and that large-scale testing is essential to obtain realistic, comparable metrics. The study provides an operationally grounded benchmark that helps standardize evaluation across protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Petersen, Camilla Mazzoleni, Riccardo Maggioni</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance across many domains, yet struggle with tasks requiring multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data. We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and cannot solve graph connectivity in constant depth, implying $\Omega(k)$ layers are necessary for $k$-hop reasoning regardless of model size or training data. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal architectural modification that provides structural inductive bias for relational reasoning. RASA adds: (1) sparse adjacency masking that restricts attention to graph-connected positions, reducing the attention pattern search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ for graphs with $m$ edges; and (2) learnable edge-type biases that encode relation-specific attention preferences. While RASA does not circumvent asymptotic depth requirements, the exponential reduction in attention pattern space provides stronger inductive bias for learning graph-structured functions. Empirically, on the MetaQA knowledge graph QA benchmark, RASA achieves 97.7% accuracy on 3-hop questions, outperforming EmbedKGQA (94.8%) by 2.9 percentage points. Notably, RASA's advantage grows with reasoning depth, validating that structural inductive bias is most beneficial for complex multi-hop queries. Our results demonstrate that minimal architectural modifications, grounded in complexity-theoretic analysis, can substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Yao, Yi-Kai Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Yueqing Sun, Zishan Xu, Yu Yang, Tianhao Hu, Qi Gu, Hui Su, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning. However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs). However, clinical RL is fundamentally bottlenecked by reward engineering: the challenge of defining signals that safely and effectively guide policy learning in complex, sparse offline environments. Existing approaches often rely on manual heuristics that fail to generalize across diverse pathologies. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline reward design and verification. We formulate the reward function using potential functions consisted of three core components: survival, confidence, and competence. We further introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select the optimal reward structure prior to deployment. By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, our framework automates the design of reward functions for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of the resulting policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Hui Song, Shuoling Liu, Liyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Lin, Aman Desai, Frank Barrows, Francesco Caravelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tharindu Cyril Weerasooriya, Sujan Dutta, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Marcos Zampieri, Christopher M. Homan, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh</p>
<p>Abstract: Offensive speech detection is a key component of content moderation. However, what is offensive can be highly subjective. This paper investigates how machine and human moderators disagree on what is offensive when it comes to real-world social web political discourse. We show that (1) there is extensive disagreement among the moderators (humans and machines); and (2) human and large-language-model classifiers are unable to predict how other human raters will respond, based on their political leanings. For (1), we conduct a noise audit at an unprecedented scale that combines both machine and human responses. For (2), we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset of vicarious offense. Our noise audit reveals that moderation outcomes vary wildly across different machine moderators. Our experiments with human moderators suggest that political leanings combined with sensitive issues affect both first-person and vicarious offense.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhroshekhar Ghosh, Aaron Y. R. Low, Yong Sheng Soh, Zhuohang Feng, Brendan K. Y. Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The dictionary learning problem can be viewed as a data-driven process to learn a suitable transformation so that data is sparsely represented directly from example data. In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</p>

In parallel, researchers have investigated higher order permutation equivariant networks. In this paper we tie these two threads together by providing a general framework for higher order permutation equivariant message passing in subgraph neural networks. In this paper we introduce a new type of mathematical object called $P$-tensors, which provide a simple way to define the most general form of permutation equivariant message passing in both the above two categories of networks. We show that the P-Tensors paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark molecular datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods for finetuning generative models for concept-driven personalization generally achieve strong results for subject-driven or style-driven generation. Recently, low-rank adaptations (LoRA) have been proposed as a parameter-efficient way of achieving concept-driven personalization. While recent work explores the combination of separate LoRAs to achieve joint generation of learned styles and subjects, existing techniques do not reliably address the problem; they often compromise either subject fidelity or style fidelity. We propose ZipLoRA, a method to cheaply and effectively merge independently trained style and subject LoRAs in order to achieve generation of any user-provided subject in any user-provided style. Experiments on a wide range of subject and style combinations show that ZipLoRA can generate compelling results with meaningful improvements over baselines in subject and style fidelity while preserving the ability to recontextualize.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix learning show that Riemannian metrics are fundamental to effective SPD neural networks. Motivated by this, we revisit the geometry of the Cholesky factors and uncover a simple product structure that enables convenient metric design. Building on this insight, we propose two fast and stable SPD metrics, Power--Cholesky Metric (PCM) and Bures--Wasserstein--Cholesky Metric (BWCM), derived via Cholesky decomposition. Compared with existing SPD metrics, the proposed metrics provide closed-form operators, computational efficiency, and improved numerical stability. We further apply our metrics to construct Riemannian Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifiers and residual blocks for SPD neural networks. Experiments on SPD deep learning, numerical stability analyses, and tensor interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our metrics.

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a partially observed matrix under the low rank assumption in the presence of fully observed side information that depends linearly on the true underlying matrix. This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ({\color{black}$k \leq 10$}), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average {\color{black}$2.3\%$} lower objective value and {\color{black}$41\%$} lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the best performing benchmark method on synthetic data. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute. On large scale real world data, our algorithm produces solutions that achieve $67\%$ lower out of sample error than benchmark methods in $97\%$ less execution time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Addison, Elizabeth Kendon, Suman Ravuri, Laurence Aitchison, Peter AG Watson</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution climate simulations are valuable for understanding climate change impacts. This has motivated use of regional convection-permitting climate models (CPMs), but these are very computationally expensive. We present a convection-permitting model generative emulator (CPMGEM), to skilfully emulate precipitation simulations by a 2.2km-resolution regional CPM at much lower cost. This utilises a generative machine learning approach, a diffusion model. It takes inputs at the 60km resolution of the driving global climate model and downscales these to 8.8km, with daily-mean time resolution, capturing the effect of convective processes represented in the CPM at these scales. The emulator is trained on simulations over England and Wales from the United Kingdom Climate Projections Local product, covering years between 1980 and 2080 following a high emissions scenario. The output precipitation has a similar spatial structure and intensity distribution as in the CPM simulations. The emulator is stochastic, which improves the realism of samples. We include some evidence about the emulator's skill for extreme events with return times up to ~100 years. We demonstrate successful transfer from a "perfect model" training setting to application using GCM variable inputs. It captures the main features of the simulated 21st century climate change, but exhibits some error in the magnitude. We also show that the method can be useful in situations with limited amounts of high-resolution data. Potential applications include producing high-resolution precipitation predictions for large-ensemble climate simulations and producing output based on different GCMs and climate change scenarios to better sample uncertainty.</p>

We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing asymptotically efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mamadou K. Keita, Adwoa Bremang, Huy Le, Dennis Owusu, Christopher Homan, Marcos Zampieri</p>
<p>Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to improve text quality and readability. Previous work on the task focused primarily on high-resource languages, while low-resource languages lack robust tools. To address this shortcoming, we present a study on GEC for Zarma, a language spoken by over five million people in West Africa. We compare three approaches: rule-based methods, machine translation (MT) models, and large language models (LLMs). We evaluated GEC models using a dataset of more than 250,000 examples, including synthetic and human-annotated data. Our results showed that the MT-based approach using M2M100 outperforms others, with a detection rate of 95.82% and a suggestion accuracy of 78.90% in automatic evaluations (AE) and an average score of 3.0 out of 5.0 in manual evaluation (ME) from native speakers for grammar and logical corrections. The rule-based method was effective for spelling errors but failed on complex context-level errors. LLMs -- Gemma 2b and MT5-small -- showed moderate performance. Our work supports use of MT models to enhance GEC in low-resource settings, and we validated these results with Bambara, another West African language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeping Wang, Shihao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve forward PDEs by minimizing residual losses from the governing equations with initial and boundary conditions, but they often struggle with discontinuities such as shocks. In contrast, finite volume methods (FVM) handle discontinuities by enforcing integral conservation, which admits weak solutions. Motivated by this, we propose a Coupled Integral PINN (CI-PINN) that augments a standard PINN with an auxiliary network for integral potentials and coupled integral constraints. This improves robustness near shocks while avoiding meshing and the numerical flux integration/reconstruction used in classical schemes. We validate CI-PINN on forward benchmarks including Burgers, Buckley--Leverett, the Euler system, and the Shallow-Water equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed ElGazzar, Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic framework for developing computational models of biological neural systems. In this framework, physiological recordings are viewed as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying continuous-time stochastic dynamical system which implements computations through its state evolution. To model this dynamical system, we employ a system of coupled stochastic differential equations with differentiable drift and diffusion functions and use variational inference to infer its states and parameters. This formulation enables seamless integration of existing mathematical models in the literature, neural networks, or a hybrid of both to learn and compare different models. We demonstrate this in our framework by developing a generative model that combines coupled oscillators with neural networks to capture latent population dynamics from single-cell recordings. Evaluation across three neuroscience datasets spanning different species, brain regions, and behavioral tasks show that these hybrid models achieve competitive performance in predicting stimulus-evoked neural and behavioral responses compared to sophisticated black-box approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer parameters, providing uncertainty estimates, and offering a natural language for interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Song, Xiangfei Yang, Shangke Lyu, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in real-time multi-sensor perception tasks due to their event-driven and parameter-efficient characteristics. A key challenge is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal hidden states (membrane potentials), which complicates the trade-off between accuracy and latency. SNNs tend to achieve better performance with longer timesteps, inevitably resulting in higher computational overhead and latency compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). Moreover, many recent advances in SNNs rely on architecture-specific optimizations, which, while effective with fewer timesteps, often limit generalizability and scalability across modalities and models. To address these limitations, we propose Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a unified hidden state update mechanism for SNNs. Inspired by the spatial propagation of membrane potentials in biological neurons, AMP2 enables dynamic transmission of membrane potentials among spatially adjacent neurons, facilitating spatiotemporal integration and cooperative dynamics of hidden states, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy while reducing reliance on extended temporal updates. This simple yet effective strategy significantly enhances SNN performance across various architectures, including MLPs and CNNs for point cloud and event-based data. Furthermore, ablation studies integrating AMP2 into Transformer-based SNNs for classification tasks demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose and efficient solution for spiking neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Shuhaib Mehri, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Beyond the concern of how LLMs persuade others, their own susceptibility to persuasion poses a critical alignment challenge, raising questions about robustness, safety, and adherence to ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasiveness and susceptibility to persuasion in multi-agent interactions. Our framework offers a scalable alternative to the costly and time-intensive human annotation process typically used to study persuasion in LLMs. PMIYC automatically conducts multi-turn conversations between Persuader and Persuadee agents, measuring both the effectiveness of and susceptibility to persuasion. Our comprehensive evaluation spans a diverse set of LLMs and persuasion settings (e.g., subjective and misinformation scenarios). We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and demonstrate alignment with human assessments from prior studies. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omri Isac, Idan Refaeli, Haoze Wu, Clark Barrett, Guy Katz</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Deep Neural Network (DNN) verifiers are typically designed to prioritize scalability over reliability. Reliability can be reinforced through the generation of proofs that are checkable by trusted, external proof checkers. To date, only a handful of verifiers support proof production; and these rely on verifier-specific formats, and balance between scalability, proof detail, and the trustworthiness of their proof checker. In this tool paper, we introduce PICID, a DNN verifier that produces proofs in the standard Alethe format for SMT solving, checkable by multiple existing checkers. PICID implements a parallel CDCL(T) architecture that integrates a state-of-the-art, proof-producing SAT solver with the Marabou DNN verifier. Furthermore, PICID leverages UNSAT proofs to derive conflict clauses. Our evaluation shows that PICID generates valid proofs in the vast majority of cases and significantly outperforms existing tools that produce comparable proofs.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of large-scale single-cell omic datasets, omic foundation models (FMs) have emerged as powerful tools for advancing research in life sciences and precision medicine. However, most existing omic FMs rely primarily on numerical transcriptomic data by sorting genes as sequences, while lacking explicit integration of biomedical prior knowledge and signaling interactions that are critical for scientific discovery. Here, we introduce the Text-Omic Signaling Graph (TOSG), a novel data structure that unifies human-interpretable biomedical textual knowledge, quantitative omic data, and signaling network information. Using this framework, we construct OmniCellTOSG, a large-scale resource comprising approximately half million meta-cell TOSGs derived from around 80 million single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles across organs and diseases. We further develop CellTOSG-FM, a multimodal graph language FM, to jointly analyze textual, omic and signaling network context. Across diverse downstream tasks, CellTOSG-FM outperforms existing omic FMs, and provides interpretable insights into disease-associated targets and signaling pathways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naima Tasnim, Atefeh Gilani, Lalitha Sankar, Oliver Kosut</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a differentially private (DP) algorithm called Reveal-or-Obscure (ROO) to generate a single representative sample from a dataset of n i.i.d. observations from an unknown distribution. Unlike methods that add explicit noise to the estimated empirical distribution, ROO achieves $\epsilon$-differential privacy by choosing whether to "reveal" or "obscure" the empirical distribution with a fixed probability $q$. While our proposed mechanism is structurally identical to an algorithm proposed by Cheu and Nayak, we prove a strictly better bound on the sampling complexity than that established in their theorem. Building on this framework, we propose a novel generalized sampler called Data-Specific ROO (DS-ROO), where the obscuring probability $q$ is a function of the empirical distribution. We show that when the dataset contains enough samples from every element of the alphabet, DS-ROO can achieve $\epsilon$-DP while obscuring much less. In addition, we provide tight upper bounds on the utility of DS-ROO in terms of total variation distance. Our results show that under the same privacy budget, DS-ROO can achieve better utility than state-of-the-art private samplers and vanilla ROO, with total variation distance decaying exponentially in dataset size $n$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Vaishnav, Praveen Kumar Donta, Sindri Magn\'usson</p>
<p>Abstract: IoT networks often face conflicting routing goals such as maximizing packet delivery, minimizing delay, and conserving limited battery energy. These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols, under dynamic and distributed settings. Sensitivity analysis across varying preference window lengths confirms that the proposed DPQ framework consistently achieves higher composite reward than all baseline methods, demonstrating robustness to changes in operating conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Etienne Gauthier, Francis Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Yang, Yikang Shen, Kaiyue Wen, Shawn Tan, Mayank Mishra, Liliang Ren, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH improves upon RoPE and other recent baselines. Finally, we show that we can convert pretrained RoPE transformers into PaTH with continued pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nayoung Kim, Seongsu Kim, Sungsoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunqin Zhu, Henry Shaowu Yuchi, Yao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning expressive kernels while retaining tractable inference remains a central challenge in scaling Gaussian processes (GPs) to large and complex datasets. We propose a scalable GP regressor based on deep basis kernels (DBKs). Our DBK is constructed from a small set of neural-network-parameterized basis functions with an explicit low-rank structure. This formulation immediately enables linear-complexity inference with respect to the number of samples, possibly without inducing points. DBKs provide a unifying perspective that recovers sparse deep kernel learning and Gaussian Bayesian last-layer methods as special cases. We further identify that naively maximizing the marginal likelihood can lead to oversimplified uncertainty and rank-deficient solutions. To address this, we introduce a mini-batch stochastic objective that directly targets the predictive distribution with decoupled regularization. Empirically, DBKs show advantages in predictive accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and computational efficiency across a range of large-scale regression benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) has brought sustainable challenges in data center management due to the high carbon emissions and short cooling response time associated with high-power density racks. While machine learning (ML) offers promise for intelligent management, its adoption is hindered by safety and reliability concerns. To address this, we propose a multiphysics-informed machine learning (MPIML) framework that integrates physical priors into data-driven models for enhanced accuracy and safety. We introduce an integrated system architecture comprising three core engines: DCLib for versatile facility modeling, DCTwin for high-fidelity multiphysics simulation, and DCBrain for decision-making optimization. This system enables critical predictive and prescriptive applications, such as carbon-aware IT provisioning, safety-aware intelligent cooling control and battery health forecasting. An illustrative example on an industry-grade data center cooling control demonstrates that our MPIML approach reduces annual carbon emissions up to 200 kilotons compared with conventional methods while ensuring operational constraints are met. We conclude by outlining key challenges and future directions for developing autonomous and sustainable data centers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates minimax and Bayes optimal strategies for fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a sampling phase followed by a recommendation phase, and we design an adaptive experiment within this framework to efficiently identify the best arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our proposed strategy, the sampling phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, in which we allocate samples uniformly across arms to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and to estimate outcome variances. Before entering the second stage, we solve a Gaussian minimax game, which yields a sampling ratio and a decision rule. In the second stage, samples are allocated according to this sampling ratio. After the sampling phase, the procedure enters the recommendation phase, where we select an arm using the decision rule. We prove that this single strategy is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, and we establish upper bounds that coincide exactly with our lower bounds, including the constant terms.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of generated videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. Through this geometric supervision, the model learns a shared 3D scene representation, enabling it to generate spatio-temporally aligned future video sequences from novel viewpoints given a single RGB-D image per view, and without relying on camera poses as input. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, yielding robot manipulation policies that generalize well to novel camera viewpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julius Herb, Felix Fritzen</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example, there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fran\c{c}ois Bachoc, Nicol\`o Cesa-Bianchi, Tommaso Cesari, Roberto Colomboni</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a stochastic budget-allocation problem over $K$ tasks. At each round $t$, the learner chooses an allocation $X_t \in \Delta_K$. Task $k$ succeeds with probability $F_k(X_{t,k})$, where $F_1,\dots,F_K$ are nondecreasing budget-to-success curves, and upon success yields a random reward with unknown mean $\mu_k$. The learner observes which tasks succeed, and observes a task's reward only upon success (censored semi-bandit feedback). This model captures, for instance, splitting payments across crowdsourcing workers or distributing bids across simultaneous auctions, and subsumes stochastic multi-armed bandits and semi-bandits.
  We design an optimism-based algorithm that operates under censored semi-bandit feedback. Our main result shows that in diminishing-returns regimes, the regret of this algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the horizon $T$ without any ad hoc tuning. For general nondecreasing curves, we prove that the same algorithm (with the same tuning) achieves a worst-case regret upper bound of $\tilde O(K\sqrt{T})$. Finally, we establish a matching worst-case regret lower bound of $\Omega(K\sqrt{T})$ that holds even for full-feedback algorithms, highlighting the intrinsic hardness of our problem outside diminishing returns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Michel, Debabrota Basu, Emilie Kaufmann</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, achieving a factor-of-2 privacy improvement and thus potentially benefiting other continual monitoring procedures. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $\varepsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dara Bahri, John Wieting</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonidas Bakopoulos, Georgios Chalkiadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhun Park, Insung Kong, Yongdai Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical guarantees of BART, and achieves comparable prediction performance. Specifically, we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART is comparable to BART in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and theoretical consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungsoo Park, Ethan Mendes, Gabriel Stanovsky, Alan Ritter</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in large language models is increasingly constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: benchmarks must be built and models run before iteration can begin. We investigate whether evaluation outcomes can be forecast before any experiments are conducted. Specifically, we study text-only performance prediction, where models estimate performance from task descriptions and experimental configurations alone, without access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. We scrape task and configuration descriptions from arXiv, yielding 2,290 instances covering 1,519 papers, and construct a test split using papers published after the evaluated models' knowledge cutoff. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: reasoning models achieve a non-trivial forecasting skill reaching mean absolute error as low as 9.9 at high-confidence thresholds. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aymen Bouguerra, Daniel Montoya, Alexandra Gomez-Villa, Chokri Mraidha, Fabio Arnez</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have revolutionized zero-shot classification and safety-critical tasks, including Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient real-world deployment. While quantization is a standard solution for efficiency, its broader impact on reliability metrics beyond simple Top-1 accuracy remains critically under-explored. In this study, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of VLM quantization across a comprehensive experimental suite of over 700k evaluation runs with varying configurations. We find that, contrary to the assumption that quantization's noise degrades performance, it can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness to noise, though not to covariate shift or spurious correlations. We leverage these counterintuitive findings to characterize the mechanics of quantization beyond simple regularization: we show that quantization dampens high-rank spectral components, compelling the model to rely more heavily on robust, low-rank features. Ultimately, this spectral filtering effect drives the observed improvements in generalization and noise tolerance, establishing a pathway to deploy faster, more reliable VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wang, Yan Sun, Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Vincent Tu, Chih-Lun Lee, Jiachen Yang, Ang Li, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their performance on long-horizon, complex problems remains unreliable. Single-rollout execution is brittle, with small errors compounding over time and leading to high variance in outcomes. While prior work has attempted to scale within a single rollout, such approaches have yielded limited gains. Scaling over multiple rollouts offers a more promising alternative but doing so effectively is challenging due to the difficulty of evaluating and selecting among long-horizon agent behaviors. We introduce Behavior Judge (BJudge), which addresses this challenge by representing agent executions as behavior narratives and comparing candidate behaviors at this level, substantially improving robustness and success rates. Using multiple rollouts, BJudge establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) in OSWorld at 72.6%, significantly outperforming prior methods and surpassing human-level performance at 72.36%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the strong effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and BJudge provides a practical framework to achieve this.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijun Zhu, Ning Yang, Baoliang Tian, Jiayu Wei, Weihao Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Pin Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Xi, Minghao Shao, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Muhammad Shafique, Ramesh Karri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and focus on coarse function- or file-level detections that offer limited guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization for targeted patches. We introduce T2L, an executable framework for project-level, line-level vulnerability localization that progressively narrows scope from repository modules to exact vulnerable lines via AST-based chunking and evidence-guided refinement. We provide a baseline agent with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses runtime evidence such as crash points and stack traces to translate failure symptoms into actionable diagnoses. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce T2L-ARVO, an expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families in real-world projects. On T2L-ARVO, our baseline achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization rate. Together, T2L framework advance LLM-based vulnerability detection toward deployable, precision diagnostics in open-source software workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Li, Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security.Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations.In this work, we propose C$^3$LLM, a novel, principled statistical Certification framework for Catastrophic risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions with statistical guarantees.We model multi-turn conversations as probability distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions--random node, graph path, and adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models, with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE) practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering 2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products. The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abdul Hannan, Ronghao Ni, Chi Zhang, Limin Jia, Ravi Mangal, Corina S. Pasareanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code generation. Despite these advances, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective mechanism for improving model performance by providing a small number of labeled examples within the prompt. Prior work has shown, however, that the effectiveness of ICL depends critically on how these few-shot examples are selected. In this paper, we study two intuitive criteria for selecting few-shot examples for ICL in the context of code vulnerability detection. The first criterion leverages model behavior by prioritizing samples on which the LLM consistently makes mistakes, motivated by the intuition that such samples can expose and correct systematic model weaknesses. The second criterion selects examples based on semantic similarity to the query program, using k-nearest-neighbor retrieval to identify relevant contexts.
  We conduct extensive evaluations using open-source LLMs and datasets spanning multiple programming languages. Our results show that for Python and JavaScript, careful selection of few-shot examples can lead to measurable performance improvements in vulnerability detection. In contrast, for C and C++ programs, few-shot example selection has limited impact, suggesting that more powerful but also more expensive approaches, such as re-training or fine-tuning, may be required to substantially improve model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable inference-time improvements through parallel thinking. However, existing methods rely on redundant sampling of reasoning trajectories, failing to effectively explore the reasoning space to uncover high-quality solutions. To address these limitations, we propose Decoding Tree Sketching (DTS), a plug-and-play decoding framework for structural multi-trajectory exploration and reasoning selection. For reasoning exploration, DTS sketches a backbone tree of the reasoning space by selectively branching at decision tokens. For reasoning selection, guided by length-accuracy anti-correlation, DTS designs an early termination to prioritize short and reliable trajectories during decoding. Experimental results across four LRMs and datasets demonstrate that DTS significantly enhances accuracy by 14% and reduces repetitive generation by 8% on average. Notably, DTS enables smaller models to outperform larger models with 10$\times$ the size, highlighting its potential to strengthen reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Feifel, Benedikt Franke, Frank Bonarens, Frank K\"oster, Arne Raulf, Friedhelm Schwenker</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.</p>

This work investigates Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs) and their multilevel extensions as a promising alternative. These methods leverage domain decomposition, partitioning the computational domain into overlapping sub-domains, each governed by a local neural network. We assess their accuracy and computational efficiency in solving the Helmholtz equation for the homogeneous case, demonstrating their potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Andrae, Erik Larsson, So Takao, Tomas Landelius, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical high-dimensional DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations that are violated for complex dynamics or observation operators. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior that first incorporates forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step, before assimilating observations via guidance-based conditional sampling. This allows us to leverage any forecasting model as part of the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel D. Richman, Jessica Karaguesian, Carl-Mikael Suomivuori, Ron O. Dror</p>
<p>Abstract: The function of biomolecules such as proteins depends on their ability to interconvert between a wide range of structures or "conformations." Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Liu, Mokai Pan, Zhongyi Wang, Kaizhen Zhu, Haotao Lu, Haipeng Zhang, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning with diffusion models has advanced robotic control by capturing the multi-modal action distributions. However, existing methods typically treat observations only as high-level conditions to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, the sampling is forced to begin from random noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We propose BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that directly integrates observations into the stochastic dynamics via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich and informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key difficulty is that diffusion bridge normally connects distributions of matched dimensionality, while robotic observations are heterogeneous and not naturally aligned with actions. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner to unify the visual and state inputs and align the observations with action representations, making diffusion bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and 5 real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingping Yin, Xiyun Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a unified framework that employs variational inference (VI) with (conditional) normalizing flows (NFs) to train both between-model and within-model proposals for reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, enabling efficient trans-dimensional Bayesian inference. In contrast to the transport reversible jump (TRJ) of Davies et al. (2023), which optimizes forward KL divergence using pilot samples from the complex target distribution, our approach minimizes the reverse KL divergence, requiring only samples from a simple base distribution and largely reducing computational cost. Especially, we develop a novel trans-dimensional VI method with conditional NFs to fit the conditional transport proposal of Davies et al. (2023). We use RealNVP flows to learn the model-specific transport maps used for constructing proposals so that the calculation is parallelizable. Our framework also provides accurate estimates of marginal likelihoods, which may facilitate efficient model comparison and help design rejection-free proposals. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate that the TRJ method trained under our framework achieves faster mixing compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwin Fong, Lancelot F. James, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Chang, Chenguang Duan, Yuling Jiao, Yi Xu, Jerry Zhijian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference-time alignment for diffusion models aims to adapt a pre-trained reference diffusion model toward a target distribution without retraining the reference score network, thereby preserving the generative capacity of the reference model while enforcing desired properties at the inference time. A central mechanism for achieving such alignment is guidance, which modifies the sampling dynamics through an additional drift term. In this work, we introduce variationally stable Doob's matching, a novel framework for provable guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-regularized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the estimated guidance. Moreover, we analyze the resulting controllable diffusion processes and prove non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the generated distributions in the 2-Wasserstein distance. Finally, we show that variationally stable guidance estimators are adaptive to unknown low dimensionality, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality under low-dimensional subspace assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wu, Tayab Uddin Wara, Daniel Hernandez, Sidong Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM), a framework that unifies semantic representations (e.g., human descriptions, diagnostic labels) and observation-driven machine representations (e.g., pixel intensities, sensor readings) into a single latent structure. Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 78.76% on CIFAR-10. Critically, the homeomorphism criterion determines when different semantic-observation pairs share compatible latent structure, enabling principled unification into universal representations and providing a mathematical foundation for decomposing general foundation models into domain-specific components.</p>

<p>Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.</p>

<p>Abstract: 6G facilitates deployment of Federated Learning (FL) in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN), yet FL confronts challenges such as resource constrained and unbalanced data distribution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Split Federated Learning (HSFL) framework and derives its upper bound of loss function. To minimize the weighted sum of training loss and latency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that integrates device association, model split layer selection, and resource allocation. We decompose the original problem into several subproblems, where an iterative optimization algorithm for device association and resource allocation based on brute-force split point search is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively balance training efficiency and model accuracy for FL in SAGIN.</p>

<p>Abstract: The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is a kernel-based nonparametric statistic for two-sample testing, whose inferential accuracy depends critically on variance characterization. Existing work provides various finite-sample estimators of the MMD variance, often differing under the null and alternative hypotheses and across balanced or imbalanced sampling schemes. In this paper, we study the variance of the MMD statistic through its U-statistic representation and Hoeffding decomposition, and establish a unified finite-sample characterization covering different hypotheses and sample configurations. Building on this analysis, we propose an exact acceleration method for the univariate case under the Laplacian kernel, which reduces the overall computational complexity from $\mathcal O(n^2)$ to $\mathcal O(n \log n)$.</p>

This separation improves coherence and controllability over end-to-end approaches. We validate the dataset through audio-text alignment (CLAP), linguistic quality metrics (BERTScore, MAUVE), and TCAV analysis confirming that concept probes recover musically meaningful patterns.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Roy, Alessandro Rinaldo, Purnamrita Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Rectified flow (RF) has gained considerable popularity largely due to its generation efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which RF automatically adapts to the intrinsic low dimensionality of the support of the target distribution to accelerate sampling. We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Deng, Zhen Fang, Sharon Li, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Xiaoqing Tan, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Jing Xu, Ping Yu, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Olga Golovneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.</p>

Experiments show the EM algorithm is faster and numerically stable compared to other root finding algorithms for the MLE for the bivariate Normal distribution, and we expect this to hold across distributions satisfying these conditions. We show how the EM algorithm leads to reproducibility for algorithms using MLE / CVE, and demonstrate how the EM algorithm leads to finding the MLE when the CV weights are known.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dani Roytburg, Matthew Bozoukov, Matthew Nguyen, Mackenzie Puig-Hall, Narmeen Oozeer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) favor their own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehao Xu, Lok Ming Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: Many genus-0 surface mapping tasks such as landmark alignment, feature matching, and image-driven registration, can be reduced (via an initial spherical conformal map) to optimizing a spherical self-homeomorphism with controlled distortion. However, existing works lack efficient mechanisms to control the geometric distortion of the resulting mapping. To resolve this issue, we formulate this as a Beltrami-space optimization problem, where the angle distortion is encoded explicitly by the Beltrami differential and bijectivity can be enforced through the constraint $\|\mu\|_{\infty}<1$. To make this practical on the sphere, we introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, together with cross-chart consistency conditions that yield a globally bijective spherical deformation (up to conformal automorphisms). Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network, we develop BOOST, a differentiable optimization framework that updates two Beltrami fields to minimize task-driven losses while regularizing distortion and enforcing consistency along the seam. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate improved task performance meanwhile maintaining controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior. We also apply the method to cortical surface registration by aligning sulcal landmarks and matching cortical sulcal depth, achieving comparative or better registration performance without sacrificing geometric validity.</p>

Missing data is traditionally viewed as a limitation because it reduces the information available to analysts and can degrade model performance. In this work, we take an alternative perspective and study missing data from a privacy preservation standpoint. Intuitively, when features are missing, less information is revealed about individuals, suggesting that missingness could inherently enhance privacy. We formalize this intuition by analyzing missing data as a privacy amplification mechanism within the framework of differential privacy. We show, for the first time, that incomplete data can yield privacy amplification for differentially private algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen Xu, Chenyan Wu, Hengyu Sun, Haiwen Hong, Mengru Wang, Yunzhi Yao, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue, Shumin Deng, Zhixuan Chu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan, Debottam Dutta, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Imagine Alice has a specific image $x^\ast$ in her mind, say, the view of the street in which she grew up during her childhood. To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiliang Song, Hongjun An, Jiangong Xiao, Haofei Zhao, Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayank Goel, Aritra Das, Paras Chopra</p>
<p>Abstract: We build a custom transformer model to study how neural networks make moral decisions on trolley-style dilemmas. The model processes structured scenarios using embeddings that encode who is affected, how many people, and which outcome they belong to. Our 2-layer architecture achieves 77% accuracy on Moral Machine data while remaining small enough for detailed analysis. We use different interpretability techniques to uncover how moral reasoning distributes across the network, demonstrating that biases localize to distinct computational stages among other findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Malard, Gael Le Lan, Daniel Wong, David Lou Alon, Yi-Chiao Wu, Sanjeel Parekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.</p>
