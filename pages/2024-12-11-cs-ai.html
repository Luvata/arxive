<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06810">I See, Therefore I Do: Estimating Causal Effects for Image Treatments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Thorat, Ravi Kolla, Niranjan Pedanekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal effect estimation under observational studies is challenging due to the lack of ground truth data and treatment assignment bias. Though various methods exist in literature for addressing this problem, most of them ignore multi-dimensional treatment information by considering it as scalar, either continuous or discrete. Recently, certain works have demonstrated the utility of this rich yet complex treatment information into the estimation process, resulting in better causal effect estimation. However, these works have been demonstrated on either graphs or textual treatments. There is a notable gap in existing literature in addressing higher dimensional data such as images that has a wide variety of applications. In this work, we propose a model named NICE (Network for Image treatments Causal effect Estimation), for estimating individual causal effects when treatments are images. NICE demonstrates an effective way to use the rich multidimensional information present in image treatments that helps in obtaining improved causal effect estimates. To evaluate the performance of NICE, we propose a novel semi-synthetic data simulation framework that generates potential outcomes when images serve as treatments. Empirical results on these datasets, under various setups including the zero-shot case, demonstrate that NICE significantly outperforms existing models that incorporate treatment information for causal effect estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang-Bin Huang, M. Brandon Westover, Eng-King Tan, Haibo Wang, Dongshun Cui, Wei-Ying Ma, Tiantong Wang, Qi He, Haikun Wei, Ning Wang, Qiyuan Tian, Kwok-Yan Lam, Xin Yao, Tien Yin Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has apparently become one of the most important techniques discovered by humans in history while the human brain is widely recognized as one of the most complex systems in the universe. One fundamental critical question which would affect human sustainability remains open: Will artificial intelligence (AI) evolve to surpass human intelligence in the future? This paper shows that in theory new AI twins with fresh cellular level of AI techniques for neuroscience could approximate the brain and its functioning systems (e.g. perception and cognition functions) with any expected small error and AI without restrictions could surpass human intelligence with probability one in the end. This paper indirectly proves the validity of the conjecture made by Frank Rosenblatt 70 years ago about the potential capabilities of AI, especially in the realm of artificial neural networks. Intelligence is just one of fortuitous but sophisticated creations of the nature which has not been fully discovered. Like mathematics and physics, with no restrictions artificial intelligence would lead to a new subject with its self-contained systems and principles. We anticipate that this paper opens new doors for 1) AI twins and other AI techniques to be used in cellular level of efficient neuroscience dynamic analysis, functioning analysis of the brain and brain illness solutions; 2) new worldwide collaborative scheme for interdisciplinary teams concurrently working on and modelling different types of neurons and synapses and different level of functioning subsystems of the brain with AI techniques; 3) development of low energy of AI techniques with the aid of fundamental neuroscience properties; and 4) new controllable, explainable and safe AI techniques with reasoning capabilities of discovering principles in nature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Song, Eran Segal, Eric Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an approach of using AI to model and simulate biology and life. Why is it important? Because at the core of medicine, pharmacy, public health, longevity, agriculture and food security, environmental protection, and clean energy, it is biology at work. Biology in the physical world is too complex to manipulate and always expensive and risky to tamper with. In this perspective, we layout an engineering viable approach to address this challenge by constructing an AI-Driven Digital Organism (AIDO), a system of integrated multiscale foundation models, in a modular, connectable, and holistic fashion to reflect biological scales, connectedness, and complexities. An AIDO opens up a safe, affordable and high-throughput alternative platform for predicting, simulating and programming biology at all levels from molecules to cells to individuals. We envision that an AIDO is poised to trigger a new wave of better-guided wet-lab experimentation and better-informed first-principle reasoning, which can eventually help us better decode and improve life.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07144">Political Actor Agent: Simulating Legislative System for Roll Call Votes Prediction with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Ruoyuan Gong, Hao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting roll call votes through modeling political actors has emerged as a focus in quantitative political science and computer science. Widely used embedding-based methods generate vectors for legislators from diverse data sets to predict legislative behaviors. However, these methods often contend with challenges such as the need for manually predefined features, reliance on extensive training data, and a lack of interpretability. Achieving more interpretable predictions under flexible conditions remains an unresolved issue. This paper introduces the Political Actor Agent (PAA), a novel agent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models to overcome these limitations. By employing role-playing architectures and simulating legislative system, PAA provides a scalable and interpretable paradigm for predicting roll-call votes. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also offers multi-view, human-understandable decision reasoning, providing new insights into political actor behaviors. We conducted comprehensive experiments using voting records from the 117-118th U.S. House of Representatives, validating the superior performance and interpretability of PAA. This study not only demonstrates PAA's effectiveness but also its potential in political science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoyu Wang, Kaiyue Zhao, Dongliang Wei, Przemys{\l}aw Andrzej Wa{\l}\k{e}ga, Dingmin Wang, Hongmin Cai, Pan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: DatalogMTL is a powerful rule-based language for temporal reasoning. Due to its high expressive power and flexible modeling capabilities, it is suitable for a wide range of applications, including tasks from industrial and financial sectors. However, due its high computational complexity, practical reasoning in DatalogMTL is highly challenging. To address this difficulty, we introduce a new reasoning method for DatalogMTL which exploits the magic sets technique -- a rewriting approach developed for (non-temporal) Datalog to simulate top-down evaluation with bottom-up reasoning. We implement this approach and evaluate it on several publicly available benchmarks, showing that the proposed approach significantly and consistently outperforms performance of the state-of-the-art reasoning techniques.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07278">Superficial Consciousness Hypothesis for Autoregressive Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosuke Miyanishi, Keita Mitani</p>
<p>Abstract: The alignment between human objectives and machine learning models built on these objectives is a crucial yet challenging problem for achieving Trustworthy AI, particularly when preparing for superintelligence (SI). First, given that SI does not exist today, empirical analysis for direct evidence is difficult. Second, SI is assumed to be more intelligent than humans, capable of deceiving us into underestimating its intelligence, making output-based analysis unreliable. Lastly, what kind of unexpected property SI might have is still unclear. To address these challenges, we propose the Superficial Consciousness Hypothesis under Information Integration Theory (IIT), suggesting that SI could exhibit a complex information-theoretic state like a conscious agent while unconscious. To validate this, we use a hypothetical scenario where SI can update its parameters "at will" to achieve its own objective (mesa-objective) under the constraint of the human objective (base objective). We show that a practical estimate of IIT's consciousness metric is relevant to the widely used perplexity metric, and train GPT-2 with those two objectives. Our preliminary result suggests that this SI-simulating GPT-2 could simultaneously follow the two objectives, supporting the feasibility of the Superficial Consciousness Hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Manginas, George Paliouras, Luc De Raedt</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) has emerged as a promising direction to integrate low level perception with high level reasoning. Unfortunately, little attention has been given to developing NeSy systems tailored to temporal/sequential problems. This entails reasoning symbolically over sequences of subsymbolic observations towards a target prediction. We show that using a probabilistic semantics symbolic automata, which combine the power of automata for temporal structure specification with that of propositional logic, can be used to reason efficiently and differentiably over subsymbolic sequences. The proposed system, which we call NeSyA (Neuro Symbolic Automata), is shown to either scale or perform better than existing NeSy approaches when applied to problems with a temporal component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raanan Y. Rohekar, Yaniv Gurwicz, Sungduk Yu, Vasudev Lal</p>
<p>Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models only trained to predict the next token, or do they implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We examine this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT-models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for in-distribution sequences. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled synthetic environment using the setup and rules of the Othello board game. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on synthetic data that only adheres to the game rules. We find that the GPT model tends to generate next moves that adhere to the game rules for sequences for which the attention mechanism encodes a causal structure with high confidence. In general, in cases for which the GPT model generates moves that do not adhere to the game rules, it also fails to capture any causal structure.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07448">Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning for LLM Experts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwu Hu, Yufeng Wang, Shuhai Zhang, Kai Zhou, Guohao Chen, Yu Hu, Bin Xiao, Mingkui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble reasoning for the strengths of different LLM experts is critical to achieving consistent and satisfactory performance on diverse inputs across a wide range of tasks. However, existing LLM ensemble methods are either computationally intensive or incapable of leveraging complementary knowledge among LLM experts for various inputs. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple LLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs. Specifically, we model the LLM ensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein an agent sequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes the output to a subsequent LLM candidate. Moreover, we devise a reward function to train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the input questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few computational resources as possible. Last, to fully transfer the expert knowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt (KTP) that enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge effectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method uses fewer computational resources to achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07472">SmartAgent: Chain-of-User-Thought for Embodied Personalized Agent in Cyber World</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Zhang, Chen Gao, Liyuan Zhang, Yong Li, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in embodied agents with multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities based on large vision-language models (LVLMs), excel in autonomously interacting either real or cyber worlds, helping people make intelligent decisions in complex environments. However, the current works are normally optimized by golden action trajectories or ideal task-oriented solutions toward a definitive goal. This paradigm considers limited user-oriented factors, which could be the reason for their performance reduction in a wide range of personal assistant applications. To address this, we propose Chain-of-User-Thought (COUT), a novel embodied reasoning paradigm that takes a chain of thought from basic action thinking to explicit and implicit personalized preference thought to incorporate personalized factors into autonomous agent learning. To target COUT, we introduce SmartAgent, an agent framework perceiving cyber environments and reasoning personalized requirements as 1) interacting with GUI to access an item pool, 2) generating users' explicit requirements implied by previous actions, and 3) recommending items to fulfill users' implicit requirements. To demonstrate SmartAgent's capabilities, we also create a brand-new dataset SmartSpot that offers a full-stage personalized action-involved environment. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to formulate the COUT process, serving as a preliminary attempt towards embodied personalized agent learning. Our extensive experiments on SmartSpot illuminate SmartAgent's functionality among a series of embodied and personalized sub-tasks. We will release code and data upon paper notification at \url{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SmartAgent}.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07617">Swarm Behavior Cloning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas N\"u{\ss}lein, Maximilian Zorn, Philipp Altmann, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
<p>Abstract: In sequential decision-making environments, the primary approaches for training agents are Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL). Unlike RL, which relies on modeling a reward function, IL leverages expert demonstrations, where an expert policy $\pi_e$ (e.g., a human) provides the desired behavior. Formally, a dataset $D$ of state-action pairs is provided: $D = {(s, a = \pi_e(s))}$. A common technique within IL is Behavior Cloning (BC), where a policy $\pi(s) = a$ is learned through supervised learning on $D$. Further improvements can be achieved by using an ensemble of $N$ individually trained BC policies, denoted as $E = {\pi_i(s)}{1 \leq i \leq N}$. The ensemble's action $a$ for a given state $s$ is the aggregated output of the $N$ actions: $a = \frac{1}{N} \sum{i} \pi_i(s)$. This paper addresses the issue of increasing action differences -- the observation that discrepancies between the $N$ predicted actions grow in states that are underrepresented in the training data. Large action differences can result in suboptimal aggregated actions. To address this, we propose a method that fosters greater alignment among the policies while preserving the diversity of their computations. This approach reduces action differences and ensures that the ensemble retains its inherent strengths, such as robustness and varied decision-making. We evaluate our approach across eight diverse environments, demonstrating a notable decrease in action differences and significant improvements in overall performance, as measured by mean episode returns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaqiang Tang, Jian Li, Nan Du, Sihong Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the superior performance of Large language models on many NLP tasks, they still face significant limitations in memorizing extensive world knowledge. Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs that encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in real-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of non-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user satisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit enhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse capabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within this framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The system utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by selecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the historical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while achieving state-of-the-art performance in stationary environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongkai Liu, Qian Lin, Chao Yu, Xiawei Wu, Yile Liang, Donghui Li, Xuetao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is an emerging field that aims to learn optimal multi-agent policies from pre-collected datasets. Compared to single-agent case, multi-agent setting involves a large joint state-action space and coupled behaviors of multiple agents, which bring extra complexity to offline policy optimization. In this work, we revisit the existing offline MARL methods and show that in certain scenarios they can be problematic, leading to uncoordinated behaviors and out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. To address these issues, we propose a new offline MARL algorithm, named In-Sample Sequential Policy Optimization (InSPO). InSPO sequentially updates each agent's policy in an in-sample manner, which not only avoids selecting OOD joint actions but also carefully considers teammates' updated policies to enhance coordination. Additionally, by thoroughly exploring low-probability actions in the behavior policy, InSPO can well address the issue of premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. Theoretically, we prove InSPO guarantees monotonic policy improvement and converges to quantal response equilibrium (QRE). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to current state-of-the-art offline MARL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arend Hintze, Christoph Adami</p>
<p>Abstract: The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes, threatening the sustainability of shared resources. Strategies to escape this dilemma, however, are in short supply. In this study, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using AI as facilitators of cooperation. We investigate three scenarios: (1) Mandatory Cooperation Policy for AI Agents, where AI agents are institutionally mandated always to cooperate; (2) Player-Controlled Agent Cooperation Policy, where players evolve control over AI agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) Agents Mimic Players, where AI agents copy the behavior of players. Using a computational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public goods games, we find that only when AI agents mimic player behavior does the critical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the dilemma. This suggests that we can leverage AI to promote collective well-being in societal dilemmas by designing AI agents to mimic human players.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Rathjens, Shirin Reyhanian, David Kappel, Laurenz Wiskott</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks in computer vision remains a fundamental challenge. While many prior approaches have focused on visualizing intermediate representations within deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, these techniques have yet to be thoroughly explored in transformer-based vision models. In this study, we apply the approach of training inverse models to reconstruct input images from intermediate layers within a Detection Transformer, showing that this approach is efficient and feasible for transformer-based vision models. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of reconstructed images across model stages, we demonstrate critical properties of Detection Transformers, including contextual shape preservation, inter-layer correlation, and robustness to color perturbations, illustrating how these characteristics emerge within the model's architecture. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models. The code for reproducing our experiments will be made available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-detection-transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing user-centric mobile applications is increasingly essential in educational technology. However, platforms like MIT App Inventor-one of the world's largest educational app development tools-face inherent limitations in supporting modern UI/UX design. This study introduces the Figma-Enhanced App Design (FEAD) Method, a structured framework that integrates Figma's advanced design tools into MIT App Inventor using an identify-design-implement workflow. Leveraging principles such as the 8-point grid system and Gestalt laws of perception, the FEAD Method empowers users to address design gaps, creating visually appealing, functional, and accessible applications. A comparative evaluation revealed that 61.2% of participants perceived FEAD-enhanced designs as on par with professional apps, compared to just 8.2% for baseline designs. These findings highlight the potential of bridging design with development platforms to enhance app creation, offering a scalable framework for students to master both functional and aesthetic design principles and excel in shaping the future of user-centric technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theofilos Spyrou, Said Hamdioui, Haralampos-G. Stratigopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining traction across various artificial intelligence (AI) tasks thanks to their potential for efficient energy usage and faster computation speed. This comparative advantage comes from mimicking the structure, function, and efficiency of the biological brain, which arguably is the most brilliant and green computing machine. As SNNs are eventually deployed on a hardware processor, the reliability of the application in light of hardware-level faults becomes a concern, especially for safety- and mission-critical applications. In this work, we propose SpikeFI, a fault injection framework for SNNs that can be used for automating the reliability analysis and test generation. SpikeFI is built upon the SLAYER PyTorch framework with fault injection experiments accelerated on a single or multiple GPUs. It has a comprehensive integrated neuron and synapse fault model library, in accordance to the literature in the domain, which is extendable by the user if needed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shipeng Liu, FNU Shrutika, Boshen Zhang, Zhehui Huang, Feifei Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration requires agents to adopt their roles and levels of support based on human needs, task requirements, and complexity. Traditional human-AI teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging the strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. The HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance and a Manager for task-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked-AI game environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited stronger preferences toward robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to the large amount of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communication to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miha Malen\v{s}ek, Bla\v{z} \v{S}krlj, Bla\v{z} Mramor, Jure Dem\v{s}ar</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic datasets are important for evaluating and testing machine learning models. When evaluating real-life recommender systems, high-dimensional categorical (and sparse) datasets are often considered. Unfortunately, there are not many solutions that would allow generation of artificial datasets with such characteristics. For that purpose, we developed a novel framework for generating synthetic datasets that are diverse and statistically coherent. Our framework allows for creation of datasets with controlled attributes, enabling iterative modifications to fit specific experimental needs, such as introducing complex feature interactions, feature cardinality, or specific distributions. We demonstrate the framework's utility through use cases such as benchmarking probabilistic counting algorithms, detecting algorithmic bias, and simulating AutoML searches. Unlike existing methods that either focus narrowly on specific dataset structures, or prioritize (private) data synthesis through real data, our approach provides a modular means to quickly generating completely synthetic datasets we can tailor to diverse experimental requirements. Our results show that the framework effectively isolates model behavior in unique situations and highlights its potential for significant advancements in the evaluation and development of recommender systems. The readily-available framework is available as a free open Python package to facilitate research with minimal friction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyad Gomaa, Gomaa Salah</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Quasar-1, a novel architecture that introduces temperature-guided reasoning to large language models through the Token Temperature Mechanism (TTM) and Guided Sequence of Thought (GSoT). Our approach leverages the concept of hot and cold tokens, where hot tokens are prioritized for their contextual relevance, while cold tokens provide supplementary information. This dynamic modulation of token importance enables the model to achieve superior logical reasoning capabilities compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that our temperature-guided attention mechanism converges to optimal reasoning paths with exponential guarantees. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across a wide range of tasks, making advanced AI reasoning accessible to a broader range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Lares, Hao Zhen, Jidong J. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable and interpretable traffic crash modeling is essential for understanding causality and improving road safety. This study introduces a novel approach to predicting collision types by utilizing a comprehensive dataset fused from multiple sources, including weather data, crash reports, high-resolution traffic information, pavement geometry, and facility characteristics. Central to our approach is the development of a Feature Group Tabular Transformer (FGTT) model, which organizes disparate data into meaningful feature groups, represented as tokens. These group-based tokens serve as rich semantic components, enabling effective identification of collision patterns and interpretation of causal mechanisms. The FGTT model is benchmarked against widely used tree ensemble models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, demonstrating superior predictive performance. Furthermore, model interpretation reveals key influential factors, providing fresh insights into the underlying causality of distinct crash types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Anand, Kritarth Prasad, Chhavi Kirtani, Ashwin R Nair, Mohit Gupta, Saloni Garg, Anurag Gautam, Snehal Buldeo, Rajiv Ratn Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in text-based tasks but struggle with the complex reasoning required for physics problems, particularly in advanced arithmetic and conceptual understanding. While some research has explored ways to enhance LLMs in physics education using techniques such as prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG), not enough effort has been made in addressing their limitations in physics reasoning. This paper presents a novel approach to improving LLM performance on physics questions using Reinforcement Learning with Human and Artificial Intelligence Feedback (RLHAIF). We evaluate several reinforcement learning methods, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Remax optimization. These methods are chosen to investigate RL policy performance with different settings on the PhyQA dataset, which includes challenging physics problems from high school textbooks. Our RLHAIF model, tested on leading LLMs like LLaMA2 and Mistral, achieved superior results, notably with the MISTRAL-PPO model, demonstrating marked improvements in reasoning and accuracy. It achieved high scores, with a 58.67 METEOR score and a 0.74 Reasoning score, making it a strong example for future physics reasoning research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces "RadCouncil," a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to enhance the generation of impressions in radiology reports from the finding section. RadCouncil comprises three specialized agents: 1) a "Retrieval" Agent that identifies and retrieves similar reports from a vector database, 2) a "Radiologist" Agent that generates impressions based on the finding section of the given report plus the exemplar reports retrieved by the Retrieval Agent, and 3) a "Reviewer" Agent that evaluates the generated impressions and provides feedback. The performance of RadCouncil was evaluated using both quantitative metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and qualitative criteria assessed by GPT-4, using chest X-ray as a case study. Experiment results show improvements in RadCouncil over the single-agent approach across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, stylistic concordance, and clarity. This study highlights the potential of utilizing multiple interacting LLM agents, each with a dedicated task, to enhance performance in specialized medical tasks and the development of more robust and adaptable healthcare AI solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer natural language queries about General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. The framework is implemented in a chatbot called TransitGPT with open-source code. TransitGPT works by guiding LLMs to generate Python code that extracts and manipulates GTFS data relevant to a query, which is then executed on a server where the GTFS feed is stored. It can accomplish a wide range of tasks, including data retrieval, calculations, and interactive visualizations, without requiring users to have extensive knowledge of GTFS or programming. The LLMs that produce the code are guided entirely by prompts, without fine-tuning or access to the actual GTFS feeds. We evaluate TransitGPT using GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet LLMs on a benchmark dataset of 100 tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility. The results show that TransitGPT can significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of transit data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Iannelli, Sneha Kuchipudi, Vera Dvorak</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize to new information by decoupling reasoning capabilities from static knowledge bases. Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling -- assigning subtasks to specialized modules -- and horizontal scaling -- replicating tasks across multiple agents -- to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints.
  In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements -- such as answer quality, cost, and latency -- into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints.
  We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Chai, Kangwei Shi, Jiaheng Xie, Chunli Liu, Yuanchun Jiang, Yezheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fake news on social media platforms poses a significant threat to societal systems, underscoring the urgent need for advanced detection methods. The existing detection methods can be divided into machine intelligence-based, crowd intelligence-based, and hybrid intelligence-based methods. Among them, hybrid intelligence-based methods achieve the best performance but fail to consider the reliability issue in detection. In light of this, we propose a novel Reliability Aware Hybrid Intelligence (RAHI) method for fake news detection. Our method comprises three integral modules. The first module employs a Bayesian deep learning model to capture the inherent reliability within machine intelligence. The second module uses an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based user response aggregation to account for the reliability in crowd intelligence. The third module introduces a new distribution fusion mechanism, which takes the distributions derived from both machine and crowd intelligence as input, and outputs a fused distribution that provides predictions along with the associated reliability. The experiments on the Weibo dataset demonstrate the advantages of our method. This study contributes to the research field with a novel RAHI-based method, and the code is shared at https://github.com/Kangwei-g/RAHI. This study has practical implications for three key stakeholders: internet users, online platform managers, and the government.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harvey McGuinness, Tianyu Wang, Carey E. Priebe, Hayden Helm</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment is a social phenomenon wherein individuals share a common goal or perspective. Mirroring, or mimicking the behaviors and opinions of another individual, is one mechanism by which individuals can become aligned. Large scale investigations of the effect of mirroring on alignment have been limited due to the scalability of traditional experimental designs in sociology. In this paper, we introduce a simple computational framework that enables studying the effect of mirroring behavior on alignment in multi-agent systems. We simulate systems of interacting large language models in this framework and characterize overall system behavior and alignment with quantitative measures of agent dynamics. We find that system behavior is strongly influenced by the range of communication of each agent and that these effects are exacerbated by increased rates of mirroring. We discuss the observed simulated system behavior in the context of known human social dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Feng, Xueyi Liu, Jiamin Lu, Pingping Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate flood prediction is crucial for disaster prevention and mitigation. Hydrological data exhibit highly nonlinear temporal patterns and encompass complex spatial relationships between rainfall and flow. Existing flood prediction models struggle to capture these intricate temporal features and spatial dependencies. This paper presents an adaptive periodic and spatial self-attention method based on LSTM (APS-LSTM) to address these challenges. The APS-LSTM learns temporal features from a multi-periodicity perspective and captures diverse spatial dependencies from different period divisions. The APS-LSTM consists of three main stages, (i) Multi-Period Division, that utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to divide various periodic patterns; (ii) Spatio-Temporal Information Extraction, that performs periodic and spatial self-attention focusing on intra- and inter-periodic temporal patterns and spatial dependencies; (iii) Adaptive Aggregation, that relies on amplitude strength to aggregate the computational results from each periodic division. The abundant experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of APS-LSTM. The code is available: https://github.com/oopcmd/APS-LSTM.</p>

Hence, this study compared several machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction and further examined the influence of a sentiment analysis indicator on the prediction of stock prices. Our results were two-fold. Firstly, we used a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach to identify sentiment features, thus evidencing the correlation between the sentiment indicator and stock price movement. Secondly, we proposed the use of GRUvader, an optimal gated recurrent unit network, for stock market prediction. Our findings suggest that stand-alone models struggled compared with AI-enhanced models. Thus, our paper makes further recommendations on latter systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the comparative performance of cutting-edge AI models, i.e., Finaance Bidirectional Encoder representations from Transsformers (FinBERT), Generatice Pre-trained Transformer GPT-4, and Logistic Regression, for sentiment analysis and stock index prediction using financial news and the NGX All-Share Index data label. By leveraging advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4 and FinBERT, alongside a traditional machine learning model, Logistic Regression, we aim to classify market sentiment, generate sentiment scores, and predict market price movements. This research highlights global AI advancements in stock markets, showcasing how state-of-the-art language models can contribute to understanding complex financial data. The models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that Logistic Regression outperformed the more computationally intensive FinBERT and predefined approach of versatile GPT-4, with an accuracy of 81.83% and a ROC AUC of 89.76%. The GPT-4 predefined approach exhibited a lower accuracy of 54.19% but demonstrated strong potential in handling complex data. FinBERT, while offering more sophisticated analysis, was resource-demanding and yielded a moderate performance. Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna and cross-validation techniques ensured the robustness of the models. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of the practical applications of AI approaches in stock market prediction and presents Logistic Regression as the most efficient model for this task, with FinBERT and GPT-4 representing emerging tools with potential for future exploration and innovation in AI-driven financial analytics</p>

<p>Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common carcinogenic pathogen worldwide. Infecting roughly 1 in 2 individuals globally, it is the leading cause of peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer. To investigate whether personalized treatments would be optimal for patients suffering from infection, we developed the H. pylori AI-clinician recommendation system. This system was trained on data from tens of thousands of H. pylori-infected patients from Hp-EuReg, orders of magnitude greater than those experienced by a single real-world clinician. We first used a simulated dataset and demonstrated the ability of our AI Clinician method to identify patient subgroups that would benefit from differential optimal treatments. Next, we trained the AI Clinician on Hp-EuReg, demonstrating the AI Clinician reproduces known quality estimates of treatments, for example bismuth and quadruple therapies out-performing triple, with longer durations and higher dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) showing higher quality estimation on average. Next we demonstrated that treatment was optimized by recommended personalized therapies in patient subsets, where 65% of patients were recommended a bismuth therapy of either metronidazole, tetracycline, and bismuth salts with PPI, or bismuth quadruple therapy with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and bismuth salts with PPI, and 15% of patients recommended a quadruple non-bismuth therapy of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole with PPI. Finally, we determined trends in patient variables driving the personalized recommendations using random forest modelling. With around half of the world likely to experience H. pylori infection at some point in their lives, the identification of personalized optimal treatments will be crucial in both gastric cancer prevention and quality of life improvements for countless individuals worldwide.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generating unsafe responses to toxic prompts is a significant issue in their applications. While various efforts aim to address this safety concern, previous approaches often demand substantial human data collection or rely on the less dependable option of using another LLM to generate corrective data. In this paper, we aim to take this problem and overcome limitations of requiring significant high-quality human data. Our method requires only a small set of unsafe responses to toxic prompts, easily obtained from the unsafe LLM itself. By employing a semantic cost combined with a negative Earth Mover Distance (EMD) loss, we guide the LLM away from generating unsafe responses. Additionally, we propose a novel lower bound for EMD loss, enabling more efficient optimization. Our results demonstrate superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines, and we further examine the nuanced effects of over-alignment and potential degradation of language capabilities when using contrastive data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source," which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification level of "open science" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and performs competitively in few-shot evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces M$^{3}$-20M, a large-scale Multi-Modal Molecular dataset that contains over 20 million molecules. Designed to support AI-driven drug design and discovery, M$^{3}$-20M is 71 times more in the number of molecules than the largest existing dataset, providing an unprecedented scale that can highly benefit training or fine-tuning large (language) models with superior performance for drug design and discovery. This dataset integrates one-dimensional SMILES, two-dimensional molecular graphs, three-dimensional molecular structures, physicochemical properties, and textual descriptions collected through web crawling and generated by using GPT-3.5, offering a comprehensive view of each molecule. To demonstrate the power of M$^{3}$-20M in drug design and discovery, we conduct extensive experiments on two key tasks: molecule generation and molecular property prediction, using large language models including GLM4, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our experimental results show that M$^{3}$-20M can significantly boost model performance in both tasks. Specifically, it enables the models to generate more diverse and valid molecular structures and achieve higher property prediction accuracy than the existing single-modal datasets, which validates the value and potential of M$^{3}$-20M in supporting AI-driven drug design and discovery.

<p>Abstract: Recent research on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically follows two approaches: LLM-centered models, which convert graph data into tokens for LLM processing, and GNN-centered models, which use LLMs to encode text features into node and edge representations for GNN input. LLM-centered models often struggle to capture graph structures effectively, while GNN-centered models compress variable-length textual data into fixed-size vectors, limiting their ability to understand complex semantics. Additionally, GNN-centered approaches require converting tasks into a uniform, manually-designed format, restricting them to classification tasks and preventing language output. To address these limitations, we introduce a new architecture that deeply integrates GNN with LLM, featuring three key innovations: (1) Structure-Aware Transformers, which incorporate GNN's message-passing capabilities directly into LLM's transformer layers, allowing simultaneous processing of textual and structural information and generating outputs from both GNN and LLM; (2) Graph-Text Cross-Attention, which processes full, uncompressed text from graph nodes and edges, ensuring complete semantic integration; and (3) GNN-LLM Twin Predictor, enabling LLM's flexible autoregressive generation alongside GNN's scalable one-pass prediction. GL-Fusion achieves outstand performance on various tasks. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on OGBN-Arxiv and OGBG-Code2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajian Feng, Guoxiao Zhang, Yadong Zhang, Yi We, Qiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation is crucial for online advertising systems. Despite significant advances in causal approaches designed to address the Sample Selection Bias problem, CVR estimation still faces challenges due to Covariate Shift. Given the intrinsic connection between the distribution of covariates in the click and non-click spaces, this study proposes an Exposure-Guided Embedding Alignment Network (EGEAN) to address estimation bias caused by covariate shift. Additionally, we propose a Parameter Varying Doubly Robust Estimator with steady-state control to handle small propensities better. Online A/B tests conducted on the Meituan advertising system demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline models with respect to CVR and GMV, validating its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritam Anand, Tathagata Bandyopadhyay, Suresh Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Jordi Chaffer, Justin Goldston, Gemach D. A. T. A. I</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperation is vital to our survival and progress. Evolutionary game theory offers a lens to understand the structures and incentives that enable cooperation to be a successful strategy. As artificial intelligence agents become integral to human systems, the dynamics of cooperation take on unprecedented significance. Decentralized frameworks like Web3, grounded in transparency, accountability, and trust, offer a foundation for fostering cooperation by establishing enforceable rules and incentives for humans and AI agents. Guided by our Incentivized Symbiosis model, a paradigm aligning human and AI agent goals through bidirectional incentives and mutual adaptation, we investigate mechanisms for embedding cooperation into human-agent coevolution. We conceptualize Incentivized Symbiosis as part of a contemporary moral framework inspired by Web3 principles, encoded in blockchain technology to define and enforce rules, incentives, and consequences for both humans and AI agents. By integrating these principles into the very architecture of human-agent interactions, Web3 ecosystems catalyze an environment ripe for collaborative innovation. Our study traverses several transformative applications of Incentivized Symbiosis, from decentralized finance to governance and cultural adaptation, illustrating how AI agents can coevolve with humans to forge a trajectory of shared, sustainable progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Wang, Huanrui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a critical step to enable efficient LLM serving under limited resource. However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed R. Ibrahim, Josef Musil, Irene Gallou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of architectural design, the foundational essence of creativity and human intelligence lies in the mastery of solving floorplans, a skill demanding distinctive expertise and years of experience. Traditionally, the architectural design process of creating floorplans often requires substantial manual labour and architectural expertise. Even when relying on parametric design approaches, the process is limited based on the designer's ability to build a complex set of parameters to iteratively explore design alternatives. As a result, these approaches hinder creativity and limit discovery of an optimal solution. Here, we present a generative latent diffusion model that learns to generate floorplans for various building types based on building footprints and design briefs. The introduced model learns from the complexity of the inter-connections between diverse building types and the mutations of architectural designs. By harnessing the power of latent diffusion models, this research surpasses conventional limitations in the design process. The model's ability to learn from diverse building types means that it cannot only replicate existing designs but also produce entirely new configurations that fuse design elements in unexpected ways. This innovation introduces a new dimension of creativity into architectural design, allowing architects, urban planners and even individuals without specialised expertise to explore uncharted territories of form and function with speed and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxiao Zhang, Yi Wei, Yadong Zhang, Huajian Feng, Qiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential in online advertising, where semantic information plays a pivotal role in shaping user decisions and enhancing CTR effectiveness. Capturing and modeling deep semantic information, such as a user's preference for "H\"aagen-Dazs' HEAVEN strawberry light ice cream" due to its health-conscious and premium attributes, is challenging. Traditional semantic modeling often overlooks these intricate details at the user and item levels. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel approach that models deep semantic information end-to-end, leveraging the comprehensive world knowledge capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our proposed LLM-infused CTR prediction framework(Multi-level Deep Semantic Information Infused CTR model via Distillation, MSD) is designed to uncover deep semantic insights by utilizing LLMs to extract and distill critical information into a smaller, more efficient model, enabling seamless end-to-end training and inference. Importantly, our framework is carefully designed to balance efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that the model not only achieves high performance but also operates with optimal resource utilization. Online A/B tests conducted on the Meituan sponsored-search system demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of Cost Per Mile (CPM) and CTR, validating its effectiveness, scalability, and balanced approach in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Fanyi Meng, Hang Li, Xiaoyang Li, Guangxu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Channel State Information (CSI) is the cornerstone in both wireless communication and sensing systems. In wireless communication systems, CSI provides essential insights into channel conditions, enabling system optimizations like channel compensation and dynamic resource allocation. However, the high computational complexity of CSI estimation algorithms necessitates the development of fast deep learning methods for CSI prediction. In wireless sensing systems, CSI can be leveraged to infer environmental changes, facilitating various functions, including gesture recognition and people identification. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant advantages over model-based approaches in these fine-grained CSI classification tasks, particularly when classes vary across different scenarios. However, a major challenge in training deep learning networks for wireless systems is the limited availability of data, further complicated by the diverse formats of many public datasets, which hinder integration. Additionally, collecting CSI data can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time and manpower. To address these challenges, we propose CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, effectively utilizing limited data through a pre-training and fine-tuning approach. Building on CSI-BERT1, we enhance the model architecture by introducing an Adaptive Re-Weighting Layer (ARL) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to better capture sub-carrier and timestamp information, effectively addressing the permutation-invariance problem. Furthermore, we propose a Mask Prediction Model (MPM) fine-tuning method to improve the model's adaptability for CSI prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in political science tasks such as election prediction, sentiment analysis, policy impact assessment, and misinformation detection. Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Zhang, Daning Cheng, Yunquan Zhang, Fangmin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) converts pre-trained Full-Precision (FP) models into quantized versions without training. While existing methods reduce size and computational costs, they also significantly degrade performance and quantization efficiency at extremely low settings due to quantization noise. We introduce a deep model series expansion framework to address this issue, enabling rapid and accurate approximation of unquantized models without calibration sets or fine-tuning. This is the first use of series expansion for neural network quantization. Specifically, our method expands the FP model into multiple low-bit basis models. To ensure accurate quantization, we develop low-bit basis model expansions at different granularities (tensor, layer, model), and theoretically confirm their convergence to the dense model, thus restoring FP model accuracy. Additionally, we design AbelianAdd/Mul operations between isomorphic models in the low-bit expansion, forming an Abelian group to ensure operation parallelism and commutativity. The experiments show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-bit settings; for example, 4-bit quantization of ResNet-50 surpasses the original accuracy, reaching 77.03%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Delibasoglu Sanjay Chakraborty Fredrik Heintz</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Zhang, Daning Cheng, Yunquan Zhang, Fangmin Liu, Jiake Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank factorization is a popular model compression technique that minimizes the error $\delta$ between approximated and original weight matrices. Despite achieving performances close to the original models when $\delta$ is optimized, a performance discrepancy remains due to the separate optimization processes for low-rank factorization and model performance, resulting in unavoidable losses. We address this issue by introducing a novel joint optimization strategy for lossless low-rank weight factorization, which, for the first time, enhances the model's performance beyond the original. Our approach begins with a theoretical analysis of the relationship between low-rank factorization and model optimization objectives, establishing a precise perturbation range for matrix factorization errors on model performance. This challenge is then reformulated as a numerical rank deficiency problem with inequality constraints and develop a joint objective that simultaneously addresses factorization error and model performance. Based on the above analysis, we propose two optimization algorithms: \textbf{a lossless optimization algorithm} that maximizes model accuracy while ensuring compression, and \textbf{a compact optimization algorithm} that minimizes model size while preserving performance. These algorithms do not require fine-tuning and can directly compress numerous deep models to achieve lossless results. Our methods demonstrate robust efficacy across various vision and language tasks. For example, the compressed model reduced by 70\% on ResNext50 outperforms the original. Our code will be made public.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work focus on how to stabilize and lossless model compression, aiming to reduce model complexity and enhance efficiency without sacrificing performance due to compression errors. A key challenge is effectively leveraging compression errors and defining the boundaries for lossless compression to minimize model loss. i.e., compression for better. Currently, there is no systematic approach to determining this error boundary or understanding its specific impact on model performance. We propose a general \textbf{L}oss\textbf{L}ess \textbf{C}ompression theoretical framework (\textbf{LLC}), which further delineates the compression neighborhood and higher-order analysis boundaries through the total differential, thereby specifying the error range within which a model can be compressed without loss. To verify the effectiveness of LLC, we apply various compression techniques, including quantization and decomposition. Specifically, for quantization, we reformulate the classic quantization search problem as a grouped knapsack problem within the lossless neighborhood, achieving lossless quantization while improving computational efficiency. For decomposition, LLC addresses the approximation problem under low-rank constraints, automatically determining the rank for each layer and producing lossless low-rank models. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple neural network architectures on different datasets. The results show that without fancy tricks, LLC can effectively achieve lossless model compression.

Thus, the use of fault tolerance mechanisms, such as safety monitors, is essential to ensure the safe behavior of the system despite the occurrence of faults. This paper presents an extensive literature review on safety monitoring of perception functions using ML in a safety-critical context. In this review, we structure the existing literature to highlight key factors to consider when designing such monitors: threat identification, requirements elicitation, detection of failure, reaction, and evaluation. We also highlight the ongoing challenges associated with safety monitoring and suggest directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiannan Huang, Shuhan Qiu, Quan Yuan, Chao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of rail transit operations, real-time passenger flow prediction is essential; however, most models primarily focus on normal conditions, with limited research addressing incident situations. There are several intrinsic challenges associated with prediction during incidents, such as a lack of interpretability and data scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage method that separates predictions under normal conditions and the causal effects of incidents. First, a normal prediction model is trained using data from normal situations. Next, the synthetic control method is employed to identify the causal effects of incidents, combined with placebo tests to determine significant levels of these effects. The significant effects are then utilized to train a causal effect prediction model, which can forecast the impact of incidents based on features of the incidents and passenger flows. During the prediction phase, the results from both the normal situation model and the causal effect prediction model are integrated to generate final passenger flow predictions during incidents. Our approach is validated using real-world data, demonstrating improved accuracy. Furthermore, the two-stage methodology enhances interpretability. By analyzing the causal effect prediction model, we can identify key influencing factors related to the effects of incidents and gain insights into their underlying mechanisms. Our work can assist subway system managers in estimating passenger flow affected by incidents and enable them to take proactive measures. Additionally, it can deepen researchers' understanding of the impact of incidents on subway passenger flows.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of the travel industry has increased the need for real-time optimization in reservation systems that could take care of huge data and transaction volumes. This study proposes a hybrid framework that ut folds an Artificial Intelligence and a Microservices approach for the performance optimization of the system. The AI algorithms forecast demand patterns, optimize the allocation of resources, and enhance decision-making driven by Microservices architecture, hence decentralizing system components for scalability, fault tolerance, and reduced downtime. The model provided focuses on major problems associated with the travel reservation systems such as latency of systems, load balancing and data consistency. It endows the systems with predictive models based on AI improved ability to forecast user demands. Microservices would also take care of different scales during uneven traffic patterns. Hence, both aspects ensure better handling of peak loads and spikes while minimizing delays and ensuring high service quality. A comparison was made between traditional reservation models, which are monolithic and the new model of AI-Microservices. Comparatively, the analysis results state that there is a drastic improvement in processing times where the system uptime and resource utilization proved the capability of AI and the microservices in transforming the travel industry in terms of reservation. This research work focused on AI and Microservices towards real-time optimization, providing critical insight into how to move forward with practical recommendations for upgrading travel reservation systems with this technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncan Deng, Shuaiting Li, Zeyu Wang, Hong Gu, Kedong Xu, Kejie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of the big neural network models puts forward new requirements for lightweight network representation methods. The traditional methods based on model compression have achieved great success, especially VQ technology which realizes the high compression ratio of models by sharing code words. However, because each layer of the network needs to build a code table, the traditional top-down compression technology lacks attention to the underlying commonalities, resulting in limited compression rate and frequent memory access. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up method to share the universal codebook among multiple neural networks, which not only effectively reduces the number of codebooks but also further reduces the memory access and chip area by storing static code tables in the built-in ROM. Specifically, we introduce VQ4ALL, a VQ-based method that utilizes codewords to enable the construction of various neural networks and achieve efficient representations. The core idea of our method is to adopt a kernel density estimation approach to extract a universal codebook and then progressively construct different low-bit networks by updating differentiable assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that VQ4ALL achieves compression rates exceeding 16 $\times$ while preserving high accuracy across multiple network architectures, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Pouplin, Katarzyna Kobalczyk, Hao Sun, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: To develop autonomous agents capable of executing complex, multi-step decision-making tasks as specified by humans in natural language, existing reinforcement learning approaches typically require expensive labeled datasets or access to real-time experimentation. Moreover, conventional methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen goals and states, thereby limiting their practical applicability. This paper presents TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning. TEDUO operates on easy-to-obtain, unlabeled datasets and is suited for the so-called in-the-wild evaluation, wherein the agent encounters previously unseen goals and states. To address the challenges posed by such data and evaluation settings, our method leverages the prior knowledge and instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the fidelity of pre-collected offline data and enable flexible generalization to new goals and states. Empirical results demonstrate that the dual role of LLMs in our framework-as data enhancers and generalizers-facilitates both effective and data-efficient learning of generalizable language-conditioned policies.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) present significant risks and opportunities, requiring improved governance to mitigate societal harms and promote equitable benefits. Current incentive structures and regulatory delays may hinder responsible AI development and deployment, particularly in light of the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose developing the following three contributions: (1) a large multimodal text and economic-timeseries foundation model that integrates economic and natural language policy data for enhanced forecasting and decision-making, (2) algorithmic mechanisms for eliciting diverse and representative perspectives, enabling the creation of data-driven public policy recommendations, and (3) an AI-driven web platform for supporting transparent, inclusive, and data-driven policymaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bardia Nadimi, Ghali Omar Boutaib, Hao Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models for Verilog code generation. However, the current quality of the generated Verilog code remains suboptimal. This is largely due to the absence of well-defined, well-organized datasets with high-quality samples, as well as a lack of innovative fine-tuning methods and models specifically trained on Verilog. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source dataset and a corresponding fine-tuning technique, which utilizes a multi-layered structure that we refer to as PyraNet. Our experiments demonstrate that employing the proposed dataset and fine-tuning approach leads to a more accurate fine-tuned model, producing syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code. The evaluation results show improvements by up-to $32.6\%$ in comparison to the CodeLlama-7B baseline model and up-to $16.7\%$ in comparison to the state-of-the-art models using VerilogEval evaluation platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Nafis Sadeq, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) leverage contextual information from conversations to generate recommendations but often struggle due to a lack of collaborative filtering (CF) signals, which capture user-item interaction patterns essential for accurate recommendations. We introduce Reddit-ML32M, a dataset that links reddit conversations with interactions on MovieLens 32M, to enrich item representations by leveraging collaborative knowledge and addressing interaction sparsity in conversational datasets. We propose an LLM-based framework that uses Reddit-ML32M to align LLM-generated recommendations with CF embeddings, refining rankings for better performance. We evaluate our framework against three sets of baselines: CF-based recommenders using only interactions from CRS tasks, traditional CRS models, and LLM-based methods relying on conversational context without item representations. Our approach achieves consistent improvements, including a 12.32% increase in Hit Rate and a 9.9% improvement in NDCG, outperforming the best-performing baseline that relies on conversational context but lacks collaborative item representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Guevara, Victor Nascimento, Johannes Schmude, Daniel Salles, Simon Corbeil-L\'etourneau, Madalina Surcel, Dominique Brunet</p>
<p>Abstract: Wind downscaling is essential for improving the spatial resolution of weather forecasts, particularly in operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). This study advances wind downscaling by extending the DownGAN framework introduced by Annau et al.,to operational datasets from the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) and High-Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS), covering the entire Canadian domain. We enhance the model by incorporating high-resolution static covariates, such as HRDPS-derived topography, into a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty, implemented using a UNET-based generator. Following the DownGAN framework, our methodology integrates low-resolution GDPS forecasts (15 km, 10-day horizon) and high-resolution HRDPS forecasts (2.5 km, 48-hour horizon) with Frequency Separation techniques adapted from computer vision. Through robust training and inference over the Canadian region, we demonstrate the operational scalability of our approach, achieving significant improvements in wind downscaling accuracy. Statistical validation highlights reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) and log spectral distance (LSD) metrics compared to the original DownGAN. High-resolution conditioning covariates and Frequency Separation strategies prove instrumental in enhancing model performance. This work underscores the potential for extending high-resolution wind forecasts beyond the 48-hour horizon, bridging the gap to the 10-day low resolution global forecast window.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenggang Tang, Yuchen Fan, Dilin Wang, Hongyu Xu, Rakesh Ranjan, Alexander Schwing, Zhicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent sparse multi-view scene reconstruction advances like DUSt3R and MASt3R no longer require camera calibration and camera pose estimation. However, they only process a pair of views at a time to infer pixel-aligned pointmaps. When dealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone pairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global optimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors. To handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the fast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view decoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while considering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view selection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view blocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further enable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training Gaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods improve significantly upon prior art. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arda Sevinc, Abdurrahman Gumus</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) was introduced in recent research as a method for improving step-by-step reasoning in Large Language Models. However, CoT has limited applications such as its need for hand-crafted few-shot exemplar prompts and no capability to adjust itself to different queries.
  In this work, we propose a system to automatically generate rationales using CoT. Our method improves multi-step implicit reasoning capabilities by decomposing the implicit query into several explicit questions. This provides interpretability for the model, improving reasoning in weaker LLMs. We test our approach with two Q\&A datasets: StrategyQA and HotpotQA. We show an increase in accuracy with both, especially on StrategyQA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Morales-Navarro, Yasmin B. Kafai, Lauren Vogelstein, Evelyn Yu, Dana\"e Metaxa</p>
<p>Abstract: While there is widespread interest in supporting young people to critically evaluate machine learning-powered systems, there is little research on how we can support them in inquiring about how these systems work and what their limitations and implications may be. Outside of K-12 education, an effective strategy in evaluating black-boxed systems is algorithm auditing-a method for understanding algorithmic systems' opaque inner workings and external impacts from the outside in. In this paper, we review how expert researchers conduct algorithm audits and how end users engage in auditing practices to propose five steps that, when incorporated into learning activities, can support young people in auditing algorithms. We present a case study of a team of teenagers engaging with each step during an out-of-school workshop in which they audited peer-designed generative AI TikTok filters. We discuss the kind of scaffolds we provided to support youth in algorithm auditing and directions and challenges for integrating algorithm auditing into classroom activities. This paper contributes: (a) a conceptualization of five steps to scaffold algorithm auditing learning activities, and (b) examples of how youth engaged with each step during our pilot study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Ratner, Elliot Farmer, Christopher Douglas, Amaury Lendasse</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing machine learning techniques has always required choosing hyperparameters. This is true whether one uses a classical technique such as a KNN or very modern neural networks such as Deep Learning. Though in many applications, hyperparameters are chosen by hand, automated methods have become increasingly more common. These automated methods have become collectively known as automated machine learning, or AutoML. Several automated selection algorithms have shown similar or improved performance over state-of-the-art methods. This breakthrough has led to the development of cloud-based services like Google AutoML, which is based on Deep Learning and is widely considered to be the industry leader in AutoML services. Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) use a fundamentally different type of neural architecture, producing better results at a significantly discounted computational cost. We benchmark the Extreme AutoML technology against Google's AutoML using several popular classification data sets from the University of California at Irvine's (UCI) repository, and several other data sets, observing significant advantages for Extreme AutoML in accuracy, Jaccard Indices, the variance of Jaccard Indices across classes (i.e. class variance) and training times.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of multimodal applications, instruction data has become critical for training multimodal language models capable of understanding complex image-based queries. Existing practices rely on powerful but costly large language models (LLMs) or multimodal language models (MLMs) to produce instruction data. These are often prone to hallucinations, licensing issues and the generation process is often hard to scale and interpret. In this work, we present a programmatic approach that employs scene graphs as symbolic representations of images and human-written programs to systematically synthesize vision-centric instruction data. Our approach ensures the interpretability and controllability of the data generation process and scales efficiently while maintaining factual accuracy. By implementing a suite of 24 single-image, 14 multi-image instruction generators, and a scene graph generation pipeline, we build a scalable, cost-effective system: ProVision which produces diverse question-answer pairs concerning objects, attributes, relations, depth, etc., for any given image. Applied to Visual Genome and DataComp datasets, we generate over 10 million instruction data points, ProVision-10M, and leverage them in both pretraining and instruction tuning stages of MLMs. When adopted in the instruction tuning stage, our single-image instruction data yields up to a 7% improvement on the 2D split and 8% on the 3D split of CVBench, along with a 3% increase in performance on QBench2, RealWorldQA, and MMMU. Our multi-image instruction data leads to an 8% improvement on Mantis-Eval. Incorporation of our data in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages of xGen-MM-4B leads to an averaged improvement of 1.6% across 11 benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In Gim, Seung-seob Lee, Lin Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) across multiple nodes, each with its own private data. While LoRA has been widely adopted for parameter efficient federated fine-tuning, recent theoretical and empirical studies highlight its suboptimal performance in the federated learning context. In response, we propose a novel, simple, and more effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that does not rely on LoRA. Our approach introduces a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer between two existing MLP layers the up proj (the FFN projection layer following the self-attention module) and down proj within the feed forward network of the transformer block. This solution addresses the bottlenecks associated with LoRA in federated fine tuning and outperforms recent LoRA-based approaches, demonstrating superior performance for both language models and vision encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Abaskohi, Spandana Gella, Giuseppe Carenini, Issam H. Laradji</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jens Ludwig, Sendhil Mullainathan, Ashesh Rambachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being used in economics research to form predictions, label text, simulate human responses, generate hypotheses, and even produce data for times and places where such data don't exist. While these uses are creative, are they valid? When can we abstract away from the inner workings of an LLM and simply rely on their outputs? We develop an econometric framework to answer this question. Our framework distinguishes between two types of empirical tasks. Using LLM outputs for prediction problems (including hypothesis generation) is valid under one condition: no "leakage" between the LLM's training dataset and the researcher's sample. Using LLM outputs for estimation problems to automate the measurement of some economic concept (expressed by some text or from human subjects) requires an additional assumption: LLM outputs must be as good as the gold standard measurements they replace. Otherwise estimates can be biased, even if LLM outputs are highly accurate but not perfectly so. We document the extent to which these conditions are violated and the implications for research findings in illustrative applications to finance and political economy. We also provide guidance to empirical researchers. The only way to ensure no training leakage is to use open-source LLMs with documented training data and published weights. The only way to deal with LLM measurement error is to collect validation data and model the error structure. A corollary is that if such conditions can't be met for a candidate LLM application, our strong advice is: don't.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative AI (Gen AI) technologies, particularly tools like ChatGPT, is significantly impacting the labor market by reshaping job roles and skill requirements. This study examines the demand for ChatGPT-related skills in the U.S. labor market by analyzing job advertisements collected from major job platforms between May and December 2023. Using text mining and topic modeling techniques, we extracted and analyzed the Gen AI-related skills that employers are hiring for. Our analysis identified five distinct ChatGPT-related skill sets: general familiarity, creative content generation, marketing, advanced functionalities (such as prompt engineering), and product development. In addition, the study provides insights into job attributes such as occupation titles, degree requirements, salary ranges, and other relevant job characteristics. These findings highlight the increasing integration of Gen AI across various industries, emphasizing the growing need for both foundational knowledge and advanced technical skills.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Henderson, Mark A. Lemley</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) model creators commonly attach restrictive terms of use to both their models and their outputs. These terms typically prohibit activities ranging from creating competing AI models to spreading disinformation. Often taken at face value, these terms are positioned by companies as key enforceable tools for preventing misuse, particularly in policy dialogs. But are these terms truly meaningful? There are myriad examples where these broad terms are regularly and repeatedly violated. Yet except for some account suspensions on platforms, no model creator has actually tried to enforce these terms with monetary penalties or injunctive relief. This is likely for good reason: we think that the legal enforceability of these licenses is questionable.
  This Article systematically assesses of the enforceability of AI model terms of use and offers three contributions. First, we pinpoint a key problem: the artifacts that they protect, namely model weights and model outputs, are largely not copyrightable, making it unclear whether there is even anything to be licensed. Second, we examine the problems this creates for other enforcement. Recent doctrinal trends in copyright preemption may further undermine state-law claims, while other legal frameworks like the DMCA and CFAA offer limited recourse. Anti-competitive provisions likely fare even worse than responsible use provisions. Third, we provide recommendations to policymakers. There are compelling reasons for many provisions to be unenforceable: they chill good faith research, constrain competition, and create quasi-copyright ownership where none should exist. There are, of course, downsides: model creators have fewer tools to prevent harmful misuse. But we think the better approach is for statutory provisions, not private fiat, to distinguish between good and bad uses of AI, restricting the latter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangli Yang, Jie Yang, Yi Guo, Johan Barthelemy</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of textual adversarial defenses has gained considerable attention in recent years due to the increasing vulnerability of natural language processing (NLP) models to adversarial attacks, which exploit subtle perturbations in input text to deceive models. This paper introduces the Defensive Dual Masking (DDM) algorithm, a novel approach designed to enhance model robustness against such attacks. DDM utilizes a unique adversarial training strategy where [MASK] tokens are strategically inserted into training samples to prepare the model to handle adversarial perturbations more effectively. During inference, potentially adversarial tokens are dynamically replaced with [MASK] tokens to neutralize potential threats while preserving the core semantics of the input. The theoretical foundation of our approach is explored, demonstrating how the selective masking mechanism strengthens the model's ability to identify and mitigate adversarial manipulations. Our empirical evaluation across a diverse set of benchmark datasets and attack mechanisms consistently shows that DDM outperforms state-of-the-art defense techniques, improving model accuracy and robustness. Moreover, when applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), DDM also enhances their resilience to adversarial attacks, providing a scalable defense mechanism for large-scale NLP applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Qu, Xiaoming Chen, Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-stream representation is the first step for many computer vision tasks using event cameras. It converts the asynchronous event-streams into a formatted structure so that conventional machine learning models can be applied easily. However, most of the state-of-the-art event-stream representations are manually designed and the quality of these representations cannot be guaranteed due to the noisy nature of event-streams. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach aiming at enhancing the quality of event-stream representations. Our approach commences with the introduction of a new event-stream representation based on spatial-temporal statistics, denoted as EvRep. Subsequently, we theoretically derive the intrinsic relationship between asynchronous event-streams and synchronous video frames. Building upon this theoretical relationship, we train a representation generator, RepGen, in a self-supervised learning manner accepting EvRep as input. Finally, the event-streams are converted to high-quality representations, termed as EvRepSL, by going through the learned RepGen (without the need of fine-tuning or retraining). Our methodology is rigorously validated through extensive evaluations on a variety of mainstream event-based classification and optical flow datasets (captured with various types of event cameras). The experimental results highlight not only our approach's superior performance over existing event-stream representations but also its versatility, being agnostic to different event cameras and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhua Chen, Lorenz Richter, Julius Berner, Denis Blessing, Gerhard Neumann, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: An effective approach for sampling from unnormalized densities is based on the idea of gradually transporting samples from an easy prior to the complicated target distribution. Two popular methods are (1) Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), where the transport is performed through successive annealed densities via prescribed Markov chains and resampling steps, and (2) recently developed diffusion-based sampling methods, where a learned dynamical transport is used. Despite the common goal, both approaches have different, often complementary, advantages and drawbacks. The resampling steps in SMC allow focusing on promising regions of the space, often leading to robust performance. While the algorithm enjoys asymptotic guarantees, the lack of flexible, learnable transitions can lead to slow convergence. On the other hand, diffusion-based samplers are learned and can potentially better adapt themselves to the target at hand, yet often suffer from training instabilities. In this work, we present a principled framework for combining SMC with diffusion-based samplers by viewing both methods in continuous time and considering measures on path space. This culminates in the new Sequential Controlled Langevin Diffusion (SCLD) sampling method, which is able to utilize the benefits of both methods and reaches improved performance on multiple benchmark problems, in many cases using only 10% of the training budget of previous diffusion-based samplers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanfei Xu, Shengheng Liu, Zihuan Mao, Shangqing Shi, Dazhuan Xu, Dongming Wang, Yongming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evolving next-generation mobile networks is designed to provide ubiquitous coverage and networked sensing. With utility of multi-view sensing and multi-node joint transmission, cell-free is a promising technique to realize this prospect. This paper aims to tackle the problem of access point (AP) deployment in cell-free systems to balance the sensing accuracy and user rate. By merging the D-optimality with Euclidean criterion, a novel integrated metric is proposed to be the objective function for both max-sum and max-min problems, which respectively guarantee the overall and lowest performance in multi-user communication and target tracking scenario. To solve the corresponding high dimensional non-convex multi-objective problem, the Soft actor-critic (SAC) is utilized to avoid risk of local optimal result. Numerical results demonstrate that proposed SAC-based APs deployment method achieves $20\%$ of overall performance and $120\%$ of lowest performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyue Zhang, David Wan, Arie Cattan, Ayal Klein, Ido Dagan, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: How to properly conduct human evaluations for text summarization is a longstanding challenge. The Pyramid human evaluation protocol, which assesses content selection by breaking the reference summary into sub-units and verifying their presence in the system summary, has been widely adopted. However, it suffers from a lack of systematicity in the definition and granularity of the sub-units. We address these problems by proposing QAPyramid, which decomposes each reference summary into finer-grained question-answer (QA) pairs according to the QA-SRL framework. We collect QA-SRL annotations for reference summaries from CNN/DM and evaluate 10 summarization systems, resulting in 8.9K QA-level annotations. We show that, compared to Pyramid, QAPyramid provides more systematic and fine-grained content selection evaluation while maintaining high inter-annotator agreement without needing expert annotations. Furthermore, we propose metrics that automate the evaluation pipeline and achieve higher correlations with QAPyramid than other widely adopted metrics, allowing future work to accurately and efficiently benchmark summarization systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Qi, Boyi Wei, Nicholas Carlini, Yangsibo Huang, Tinghao Xie, Luxi He, Matthew Jagielski, Milad Nasr, Prateek Mittal, Peter Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Stakeholders -- from model developers to policymakers -- seek to minimize the dual-use risks of large language models (LLMs). An open challenge to this goal is whether technical safeguards can impede the misuse of LLMs, even when models are customizable via fine-tuning or when model weights are fully open. In response, several recent studies have proposed methods to produce durable LLM safeguards for open-weight LLMs that can withstand adversarial modifications of the model's weights via fine-tuning. This holds the promise of raising adversaries' costs even under strong threat models where adversaries can directly fine-tune model weights. However, in this paper, we urge for more careful characterization of the limits of these approaches. Through several case studies, we demonstrate that even evaluating these defenses is exceedingly difficult and can easily mislead audiences into thinking that safeguards are more durable than they really are. We draw lessons from the evaluation pitfalls that we identify and suggest future research carefully cabin claims to more constrained, well-defined, and rigorously examined threat models, which can provide more useful and candid assessments to stakeholders.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human emotion synthesis is a crucial aspect of affective computing. It involves using computational methods to mimic and convey human emotions through various modalities, with the goal of enabling more natural and effective human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in generative models, such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, and Sequence-to-Sequence Models, have significantly contributed to the development of this field. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive reviews in this field. To address this problem, this paper aims to address this gap by providing a thorough and systematic overview of recent advancements in human emotion synthesis based on generative models. Specifically, this review will first present the review methodology, the emotion models involved, the mathematical principles of generative models, and the datasets used. Then, the review covers the application of different generative models to emotion synthesis based on a variety of modalities, including facial images, speech, and text. It also examines mainstream evaluation metrics. Additionally, the review presents some major findings and suggests future research directions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of generative technology in the nuanced domain of emotion synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Li, Song Wang, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preconditioning techniques are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of solving large-scale linear equation systems that arise from partial differential equation (PDE) discretization. These techniques, such as Incomplete Cholesky factorization (IC) and data-driven neural network methods, accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers like Conjugate Gradient (CG) by approximating the original matrices. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) with traditional IC, addressing the shortcomings of direct generation methods based on GNN and achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate an average reduction in iteration counts by 24.8% compared to IC and a two-order-of-magnitude increase in training scale compared to previous methods. A three-dimensional static structural analysis utilizing finite element methods was validated on training sparse matrices of up to 5 million dimensions and inference scales of up to 10 million. Furthermore, the approach demon-strates robust generalization capabilities across scales, facilitating the effective acceleration of CG solvers for large-scale linear equations using small-scale data on modest hardware. The method's robustness and scalability make it a practical solution for computational science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image Translation (IT) holds immense potential across diverse domains, enabling the translation of textual content within images into various languages. However, existing datasets often suffer from limitations in scale, diversity, and quality, hindering the development and evaluation of IT models. To address this issue, we introduce MIT-10M, a large-scale parallel corpus of multilingual image translation with over 10M image-text pairs derived from real-world data, which has undergone extensive data cleaning and multilingual translation validation. It contains 840K images in three sizes, 28 categories, tasks with three levels of difficulty and 14 languages image-text pairs, which is a considerable improvement on existing datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate and train models on MIT-10M. The experimental results clearly indicate that our dataset has higher adaptability when it comes to evaluating the performance of the models in tackling challenging and complex image translation tasks in the real world. Moreover, the performance of the model fine-tuned with MIT-10M has tripled compared to the baseline model, further confirming its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayak Chakrabarty, Souradip Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Multiple Choice Reasoning via. Process of Elimination using Multi-Modal models, herein referred to as Multi-Modal Process of Elimination (MM-PoE). This novel methodology is engineered to augment the efficacy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multiple-choice visual reasoning tasks. Diverging from conventional approaches that evaluate each option independently, MM-PoE employs a dual-step scoring paradigm that initially identifies and excludes implausible choices, subsequently concentrating on the most probable remaining options. This method emulates human test-taking strategies, where individuals typically eliminate clearly incorrect answers prior to selecting the optimal response. Our empirical evaluations, conducted across three benchmark datasets, reveal that MM-PoE significantly improves both zero-shot and few-shot performance of contemporary state-of-the-art VLMs. Critically, this approach not only broadens the application of the elimination process to multi-modal contexts but also allows few-shot experiments, thereby addressing two principal limitations concerning usage of PoE only in zero-shot settings and only with a language-only framework. As a result, MM-PoE not only refines the reasoning capabilities of VLMs but also broadens their applicability to complex visual question-answering scenarios. All code and documentation supporting our work are available at https://pypi.org/project/mm-poe/, enabling researchers and practitioners to easily integrate and further develop these techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Occupancy Network has recently attracted much attention in autonomous driving. Instead of monocular 3D detection and recent bird's eye view(BEV) models predicting 3D bounding box of obstacles, Occupancy Network predicts the category of voxel in specified 3D space around the ego vehicle via transforming 3D detection task into 3D voxel segmentation task, which has much superiority in tackling category outlier obstacles and providing fine-grained 3D representation. However, existing methods usually require huge computation resources than previous methods, which hinder the Occupancy Network solution applying in intelligent driving systems. To address this problem, we make an analysis of the bottleneck of Occupancy Network inference cost, and present a simple and fast Occupancy Network model, which adopts a deformable 2D convolutional layer to lift BEV feature to 3D voxel feature and presents an efficient voxel feature pyramid network (FPN) module to improve performance with few computational cost. Further, we present a cost-free 2D segmentation branch in perspective view after feature extractors for Occupancy Network during inference phase to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and inference speed, which surpasses recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) OCCNet by 1.7% with ResNet50 backbone with about 3X inference speedup. Furthermore, our method can be easily applied to existing BEV models to transform them into Occupancy Network models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Adkins, Michael Bowling, Adam White</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of modern reinforcement learning algorithms critically relies on tuning ever-increasing numbers of hyperparameters. Often, small changes in a hyperparameter can lead to drastic changes in performance, and different environments require very different hyperparameter settings to achieve state-of-the-art performance reported in the literature. We currently lack a scalable and widely accepted approach to characterizing these complex interactions. This work proposes a new empirical methodology for studying, comparing, and quantifying the sensitivity of an algorithm's performance to hyperparameter tuning for a given set of environments. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology by assessing the hyperparameter sensitivity of several commonly used normalization variants of PPO. The results suggest that several algorithmic performance improvements may, in fact, be a result of an increased reliance on hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Xue, Ruo-Tong Chen, Xi Lin, Yunqi Shi, Shixiong Kai, Siyuan Xu, Chao Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern chip design, placement aims at placing millions of circuit modules, which is an essential step that significantly influences power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising technique for improving placement quality, especially macro placement. However, current RL-based placement methods suffer from long training times, low generalization ability, and inability to guarantee PPA results. A key issue lies in the problem formulation, i.e., using RL to place from scratch, which results in limits useful information and inaccurate rewards during the training process. In this work, we propose an approach that utilizes RL for the refinement stage, which allows the RL policy to learn how to adjust existing placement layouts, thereby receiving sufficient information for the policy to act and obtain relatively dense and precise rewards. Additionally, we introduce the concept of regularity during training, which is considered an important metric in the chip design industry but is often overlooked in current RL placement methods. We evaluate our approach on the ISPD 2005 and ICCAD 2015 benchmark, comparing the global half-perimeter wirelength and regularity of our proposed method against several competitive approaches. Besides, we test the PPA performance using commercial software, showing that RL as a regulator can achieve significant PPA improvements. Our RL regulator can fine-tune placements from any method and enhance their quality. Our work opens up new possibilities for the application of RL in placement, providing a more effective and efficient approach to optimizing chip design.

<p>Abstract: This study focuses on enhancing rice leaf disease image classification algorithms, which have traditionally relied on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. We employed transfer learning with MobileViTV2_050 using ImageNet-1k weights, a lightweight model that integrates CNN's local feature extraction with Vision Transformers' global context learning through a separable self-attention mechanism. Our approach resulted in a significant 15.66% improvement in classification accuracy for MobileViTV2_050-A, our first enhanced model trained on the baseline dataset, achieving 93.14%. Furthermore, MobileViTV2_050-B, our second enhanced model trained on a broader rice leaf dataset, demonstrated a 22.12% improvement, reaching 99.6% test accuracy. Additionally, MobileViTV2-A attained an F1-score of 93% across four rice labels and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve ranging from 87% to 97%. In terms of resource consumption, our enhanced models reduced the total parameters of the baseline CNN model by up to 92.50%, from 14 million to 1.1 million. These results indicate that MobileViTV2_050 not only improves computational efficiency through its separable self-attention mechanism but also enhances global context learning. Consequently, it offers a lightweight and robust solution suitable for mobile deployment, advancing the interpretability and practicality of models in precision agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Du, Guoshun Nan, Jiawen Qian, Wangchenhui Wu, Wendi Deng, Hanqing Mu, Zhenyan Chen, Pengxuan Mao, Xiaofeng Tao, Jun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly understanding (VAU) have opened the door to groundbreaking applications in various fields, such as traffic monitoring and industrial automation. While the current benchmarks in VAU predominantly emphasize the detection and localization of anomalies. Here, we endeavor to delve deeper into the practical aspects of VAU by addressing the essential questions: "what anomaly occurred?", "why did it happen?", and "how severe is this abnormal event?". In pursuit of these answers, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Exploring the Causation of Video Anomalies (ECVA). Our benchmark is meticulously designed, with each video accompanied by detailed human annotations. Specifically, each instance of our ECVA involves three sets of human annotations to indicate "what", "why" and "how" of an anomaly, including 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2) natural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text reflecting the effect of the abnormality. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel prompt-based methodology that serves as a baseline for tackling the intricate challenges posed by ECVA. We utilize "hard prompt" to guide the model to focus on the critical parts related to video anomaly segments, and "soft prompt" to establish temporal and spatial relationships within these anomaly segments. Furthermore, we propose AnomEval, a specialized evaluation metric crafted to align closely with human judgment criteria for ECVA. This metric leverages the unique features of the ECVA dataset to provide a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of various video large language models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through rigorous experimental analysis and delineate possible avenues for further investigation into the comprehension of video anomaly causation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shukuan Wang, Ke Xue, Lei Song, Xiaobin Huang, Chao Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for computationally expensive black-box optimization. However, traditional BO methods need to solve new problems from scratch, leading to slow convergence. Recent studies try to extend BO to a transfer learning setup to speed up the optimization, where search space transfer is one of the most promising approaches and has shown impressive performance on many tasks. However, existing search space transfer methods either lack an adaptive mechanism or are not flexible enough, making it difficult to efficiently identify promising search space during the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a search space transfer learning method based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), called MCTS-transfer, to iteratively divide, select, and optimize in a learned subspace. MCTS-transfer can not only provide a well-performing search space for warm-start but also adaptively identify and leverage the information of similar source tasks to reconstruct the search space during the optimization process. Experiments on synthetic functions, real-world problems, Design-Bench and hyper-parameter optimization show that MCTS-transfer can demonstrate superior performance compared to other search space transfer methods under different settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushun Dong, Patrick Soga, Yinhan He, Song Wang, Jundong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based learning tasks. While their performance is often attributed to the powerful neighborhood aggregation mechanism, recent studies suggest that other components such as non-linear layers may also significantly affecting how GNNs process the input graph data in the spectral domain. Such evidence challenges the prevalent opinion that neighborhood aggregation mechanisms dominate the behavioral characteristics of GNNs in the spectral domain. To demystify such a conflict, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to measure and evaluate GNNs' capability in capturing and leveraging the information encoded in different frequency components of the input graph data. Specifically, we first conduct an exploratory study demonstrating that GNNs can flexibly yield outputs with diverse frequency components even when certain frequencies are absent or filtered out from the input graph data. We then formulate a novel research problem of measuring and benchmarking the performance of GNNs from a spectral perspective. To take an initial step towards a comprehensive benchmark, we design an evaluation protocol supported by comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark on real-world datasets, revealing insights that challenge prevalent opinions from a spectral perspective. We believe that our findings will open new avenues for future advancements in this area. Our implementations can be found at: https://github.com/yushundong/Spectral-benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI models expand in size, it has become increasingly challenging to deploy federated learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices. To tackle this issue, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as an FL framework with reduced workload on edge devices via model splitting; it has received extensive attention from the research community in recent years. Nevertheless, most prior works on SFL focus only on a two-tier architecture without harnessing multi-tier cloudedge computing resources. In this paper, we intend to analyze and optimize the learning performance of SFL under multi-tier systems. Specifically, we propose the hierarchical SFL (HSFL) framework and derive its convergence bound. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem for model splitting (MS) and model aggregation (MA). To solve this rather hard problem, we then decompose it into MS and MA subproblems that can be solved via an iterative descending algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the tailored algorithm can effectively optimize MS and MA for SFL within virtually any multi-tier system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Students are increasingly relying on Generative AI (GAI) to support their writing-a key pedagogical practice in education. In GAI-assisted writing, students can delegate core cognitive tasks (e.g., generating ideas and turning them into sentences) to GAI while still producing high-quality essays. This creates new challenges for teachers in assessing and supporting student learning, as they often lack insight into whether students are engaging in meaningful cognitive processes during writing or how much of the essay's quality can be attributed to those processes. This study aimed to help teachers better assess and support student learning in GAI-assisted writing by examining how different writing behaviors, especially those indicative of meaningful learning versus those that are not, impact essay quality. Using a dataset of 1,445 GAI-assisted writing sessions, we applied the cutting-edge method, X-Learner, to quantify the causal impact of three GAI-assisted writing behavioral patterns (i.e., seeking suggestions but not accepting them, seeking suggestions and accepting them as they are, and seeking suggestions and accepting them with modification) on four measures of essay quality (i.e., lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, text cohesion, and linguistic bias). Our analysis showed that writers who frequently modified GAI-generated text-suggesting active engagement in higher-order cognitive processes-consistently improved the quality of their essays in terms of lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and text cohesion. In contrast, those who often accepted GAI-generated text without changes, primarily engaging in lower-order processes, saw a decrease in essay quality. Additionally, while human writers tend to introduce linguistic bias when writing independently, incorporating GAI-generated text-even without modification-can help mitigate this bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saaduddin Mahmud, Mason Nakamura, Shlomo Zilberstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in using natural language for preference learning. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational burdens, taxing human supervision, and lack of interpretability. To address these issues, we introduce MAPLE, a framework for large language model-guided Bayesian active preference learning. MAPLE leverages LLMs to model the distribution over preference functions, conditioning it on both natural language feedback and conventional preference learning feedback, such as pairwise trajectory rankings. MAPLE also employs active learning to systematically reduce uncertainty in this distribution and incorporates a language-conditioned active query selection mechanism to identify informative and easy-to-answer queries, thus reducing human burden. We evaluate MAPLE's sample efficiency and preference inference quality across two benchmarks, including a real-world vehicle route planning benchmark using OpenStreetMap data. Our results demonstrate that MAPLE accelerates the learning process and effectively improves humans' ability to answer queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Cheng, Ning Gao, Yun Yue, Zhiling Ye, Jiadi Jiang, Jian Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed training methods are crucial for large language models (LLMs). However, existing distributed training methods often suffer from communication bottlenecks, stragglers, and limited elasticity. Local SGD methods have been proposed to address these issues, but their effectiveness remains limited to small-scale training due to additional memory overhead and lack of concerns on efficiency and stability. To tackle these issues, we propose EDiT, an innovative Efficient Distributed Training method that combines a tailored Local SGD approach with model sharding techniques to enhance large-scale training efficiency. EDiT performs layer-wise parameter synchronization during forward pass, reducing communication and memory overhead and enabling the overlap of computation and communication. Besides, EDiT employs a pseudo gradient penalty strategy to suppress loss spikes, which ensures training stability and improve performance. Additionally, we introduce A-EDiT, a fully asynchronous variant of EDiT that accommodates heterogeneous clusters. Building on EDiT/A-EDiT, we conduct a series of experiments to validate large-scale asynchronous training for LLMs, accompanied by comprehensive analyses. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of EDiT/A-EDiT, establishing them as robust solutions for distributed LLM training in diverse computational ecosystems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Faced with the burgeoning volume of academic literature, researchers often need help with uncertain article quality and mismatches in term searches using traditional academic engines. We introduce IntellectSeeker, an innovative and personalized intelligent academic literature management platform to address these challenges. This platform integrates a Large Language Model (LLM)--based semantic enhancement bot with a sophisticated probability model to personalize and streamline literature searches. We adopted the GPT-3.5-turbo model to transform everyday language into professional academic terms across various scenarios using multiple rounds of few-shot learning. This adaptation mainly benefits academic newcomers, effectively bridging the gap between general inquiries and academic terminology. The probabilistic model intelligently filters academic articles to align closely with the specific interests of users, which are derived from explicit needs and behavioral patterns. Moreover, IntellectSeeker incorporates an advanced recommendation system and text compression tools. These features enable intelligent article recommendations based on user interactions and present search results through concise one-line summaries and innovative word cloud visualizations, significantly enhancing research efficiency and user experience. IntellectSeeker offers academic researchers a highly customizable literature management solution with exceptional search precision and matching capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), coupled with SQL, is essential for data analysts involved in data exploration and analysis. However, data analysts often encounter two primary challenges: (1) the need to craft SQL queries skillfully, and (2) the requirement to generate suitable visualization types that enhance the interpretation of query results. Due to its significance, substantial research efforts have been made to explore different approaches to address these challenges, including leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to meet real-world data exploration requirements primarily due to (1) complex database schema; (2) unclear user intent; (3) limited cross-domain generalization capability; and (4) insufficient end-to-end text-to-visualization capability.
  This paper presents TiInsight, an automated SQL-based cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, we propose hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC), which leverages LLMs to summarize the contexts related to the database schema, which is crucial for open-world EDA systems to generalize across data domains. Second, the EDA system is divided into four components (i.e., stages): HDC generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL generation (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Finally, we implemented an end-to-end EDA system with a user-friendly GUI interface in the production environment at PingCAP. We have also open-sourced all APIs of TiInsight to facilitate research within the EDA community. Through extensive evaluations by a real-world user study, we demonstrate that TiInsight offers remarkable performance compared to human experts. Specifically, TiSQL achieves an execution accuracy of 86.3% on the Spider dataset using GPT-4. It also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Bird dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchun He, Yuhan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Single image super-resolution (SR) has long posed a challenge in the field of computer vision. While the advent of deep learning has led to the emergence of numerous methods aimed at tackling this persistent issue, the current methodologies still encounter challenges in modeling long sequence information, leading to limitations in effectively capturing the global pixel interactions. To tackle this challenge and achieve superior SR outcomes, we propose the Mamba pixel-wise sequential interaction network (MPSI), aimed at enhancing the establishment of long-range connections of information, particularly focusing on pixel-wise sequential interaction. We propose the Channel-Mamba Block (CMB) to capture comprehensive pixel interaction information by effectively modeling long sequence information. Moreover, in the existing SR methodologies, there persists the issue of the neglect of features extracted by preceding layers, leading to the loss of valuable feature information. While certain existing models strive to preserve these features, they frequently encounter difficulty in establishing connections across all layers. To overcome this limitation, MPSI introduces the Mamba channel recursion module (MCRM), which maximizes the retention of valuable feature information from early layers, thereby facilitating the acquisition of pixel sequence interaction information from multiple-level layers. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that MPSI outperforms existing super-resolution methods in terms of image reconstruction results, attaining state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for modeling and conditional generation of 3D articulated objects. Troubled by flexibility-quality tradeoffs, existing methods are often limited to using predefined structures or retrieving shapes from static datasets. To address these challenges, we parameterize an articulated object as a tree of tokens and employ a transformer to generate both the object's high-level geometry code and its kinematic relations. Subsequently, each sub-part's geometry is further decoded using a signed-distance-function (SDF) shape prior, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality 3D shapes. Our approach enables the generation of diverse objects with high-quality geometry and varying number of parts. Comprehensive experiments on conditional generation from text descriptions demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing rates of global urbanization and vehicle usage are leading to a shift of mobility to the third dimension-through Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)-offering a promising solution for faster, safer, cleaner, and more efficient transportation. As air transportation continues to evolve with more automated and autonomous systems, advancements in AAM require a deep understanding of human-computer interaction and human-AI collaboration to ensure safe and effective operations in complex urban and regional environments. There has been a significant increase in publications regarding these emerging applications; thus, there is a need to review developments in this area. This paper comprehensively reviews the current state of research on human-computer interaction and human-AI collaboration in AAM. Specifically, we focus on AAM applications related to the design of human-machine interfaces for various uses, including pilot training, air traffic management, and the integration of AI-assisted decision-making systems with immersive technologies such as extended, virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges AAM encounters in integrating human-computer frameworks, including unique challenges associated with these interactions, such as trust in AI systems and safety concerns. Finally, we highlight emerging opportunities and propose future research directions to bridge the gap between human factors and technological advancements in AAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biswadeep Chakraborty, Harshit Kumar, Saibal Mukhopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) poses a significant challenge as network depth increases, leading to homogenized node representations and a loss of expressiveness. In this work, we approach the oversmoothing problem from a dynamical systems perspective, providing a deeper understanding of the stability and convergence behavior of GNNs. Leveraging insights from dynamical systems theory, we identify the root causes of oversmoothing and propose \textbf{\textit{DYNAMO-GAT}}. This approach utilizes noise-driven covariance analysis and Anti-Hebbian principles to selectively prune redundant attention weights, dynamically adjusting the network's behavior to maintain node feature diversity and stability. Our theoretical analysis reveals how DYNAMO-GAT disrupts the convergence to oversmoothed states, while experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods. DYNAMO-GAT not only advances the theoretical understanding of oversmoothing through the lens of dynamical systems but also provides a practical and effective solution for improving the stability and expressiveness of deep GNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhao, Xiaojun Chen, Yuexin Xuan, Zhendong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the digital age, the proliferation of deep learning models has led to significant concerns about the generation of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. Existing defense methods primarily involve model fine-tuning and post-hoc content moderation. However, these approaches often lack scalability in eliminating harmful content, degrade the quality of benign image generation, or incur high inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose an innovative framework called \textbf{Buster}, which injects backdoor attacks into the text encoder to prevent NSFW content generation. Specifically, Buster leverages deep semantic information rather than explicit prompts as triggers, redirecting NSFW prompts towards targeted benign prompts. This approach demonstrates exceptional resilience and scalability in mitigating NSFW content. Remarkably, Buster fine-tunes the text encoder of Text-to-Image models within just five minutes, showcasing high efficiency. Our extensive experiments reveal that Buster outperforms all other baselines, achieving superior NSFW content removal rate while preserving the quality of harmless images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinhong Lin, Linna Zhou, Zhongliang Yang, Yuang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display formidable capabilities in generative tasks but also pose potential risks due to their tendency to generate hallucinatory responses. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), the evaluation of model output reliability, is crucial for ensuring the safety and robustness of AI systems. Recent studies have concentrated on model uncertainty by analyzing the relationship between output entropy under various sampling conditions and the corresponding labels. However, these methods primarily focus on measuring model entropy with precision to capture response characteristics, often neglecting the uncertainties associated with greedy decoding results-the sources of model labels, which can lead to biased classification outcomes. In this paper, we explore the biases introduced by greedy decoding and propose a label-confidence-aware (LCA) uncertainty estimation based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence bridging between samples and label source, thus enhancing the reliability and stability of uncertainty assessments. Our empirical evaluations across a range of popular LLMs and NLP datasets reveal that different label sources can indeed affect classification, and that our approach can effectively capture differences in sampling results and label sources, demonstrating more effective uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Su, Shan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are a family of graph neural networks designed to model and learn dynamic information from temporal graphs. Given their substantial empirical success, there is an escalating interest in TGNNs within the research community. However, the majority of these efforts have been channelled towards algorithm and system design, with the evaluation metrics receiving comparatively less attention. Effective evaluation metrics are crucial for providing detailed performance insights, particularly in the temporal domain. This paper investigates the commonly used evaluation metrics for TGNNs and illustrates the failure mechanisms of these metrics in capturing essential temporal structures in the predictive behaviour of TGNNs. We provide a mathematical formulation of existing performance metrics and utilize an instance-based study to underscore their inadequacies in identifying volatility clustering (the occurrence of emerging errors within a brief interval). This phenomenon has profound implications for both algorithm and system design in the temporal domain. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new volatility-aware evaluation metric (termed volatility cluster statistics), designed for a more refined analysis of model temporal performance. Additionally, we demonstrate how this metric can serve as a temporal-volatility-aware training objective to alleviate the clustering of temporal errors. Through comprehensive experiments on various TGNN models, we validate our analysis and the proposed approach. The empirical results offer revealing insights: 1) existing TGNNs are prone to making errors with volatility clustering, and 2) TGNNs with different mechanisms to capture temporal information exhibit distinct volatility clustering patterns. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our proposed training objective effectively reduces volatility clusters in error.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to improve the performance of large language models by addressing the variable computational demands in inference steps, where some tokens require more computational resources than others. We present HARP, a simple modification to "off-the-shelf" Transformer forward pass. Drawing from hesitation and the framing effect in decision-making, HARP selectively applies additional computation when the model encounters uncertainty during token generation. Our method mimics human cognitive processes by pausing at difficult decision points and reframing inputs for a different perspective. Unlike other approaches, HARP is model-agnostic, training-free, and easy to implement. We thoroughly evaluate our method across various downstream tasks and model sizes, demonstrating performance improvements up to +5.16%. Notably, HARP achieves these gains while maintaining inference times twice faster than beam search. Simple and yet with significant gains, HARP offers a practical solution for enhancing the performance of Transformer-based language models with minimal computational impact.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) aims to synthesize high-quality person images corresponding to target poses while preserving the appearance of the source image. Recently, PGPIS methods that use diffusion models have achieved competitive performance. Most approaches involve extracting representations of the target pose and source image and learning their relationships in the generative model's training process. This approach makes it difficult to learn the semantic relationships between the input and target images and complicates the model structure needed to enhance generation results. To address these issues, we propose Fusion embedding for PGPIS using a Diffusion Model (FPDM). Inspired by the successful application of pre-trained CLIP models in text-to-image diffusion models, our method consists of two stages. The first stage involves training the fusion embedding of the source image and target pose to align with the target image's embedding. In the second stage, the generative model uses this fusion embedding as a condition to generate the target image. We applied the proposed method to the benchmark datasets DeepFashion and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, and conducted both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. An ablation study of the model structure showed that even a model using only the second stage achieved performance close to the other PGPIS SOTA models.

<p>Abstract: AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Lv, Chen Tang, Yanan Zhang, Xin Liu, Yue Yu, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensembles of generative large language models (LLMs) can integrate the strengths of different LLMs to compensate for the limitations of individual models. However, recent work has focused on training an additional fusion model to combine complete responses from multiple LLMs, failing to tap into their collaborative potential to generate higher-quality responses. Moreover, as the additional fusion model is trained on a specialized dataset, these methods struggle with generalizing to open-domain queries from online users. In this paper, we propose SpecFuse, a novel ensemble framework that outputs the fused result by iteratively producing the next segment through collaboration among LLMs. This is achieved through cyclic execution of its inference and verification components. In each round, the inference component invokes each base LLM to generate candidate segments in parallel, and the verify component calls these LLMs again to predict the ranking of the segments. The top-ranked segment is then broadcast to all LLMs, encouraging them to generate higher-quality segments in the next round. This approach also allows the base LLMs to be plug-and-play, without any training or adaptation, avoiding generalization limitations. Furthermore, to conserve computational resources, we propose a model exit mechanism that dynamically excludes models exhibiting poor performance in previous rounds during each query response. In this way, it effectively reduces the number of model calls while maintaining overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for diagnosing and planning treatment in various medical conditions due to its ability to produce multi-series images that reveal different tissue characteristics. However, integrating these diverse series to form a coherent analysis presents significant challenges, such as differing spatial resolutions and contrast patterns meanwhile requiring extensive annotated data, which is scarce in clinical practice. Due to these issues, we introduce a novel Cross-Series Masking (CSM) Strategy for effectively learning MRI representation in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, CSM commences by randomly sampling a subset of regions and series, which are then strategically masked. In the training process, the cross-series representation is learned by utilizing the unmasked data to reconstruct the masked portions. This process not only integrates information across different series but also facilitates the ability to model both intra-series and inter-series correlations and complementarities. With the learned representation, the downstream tasks like segmentation and classification are also enhanced. Taking brain tissue segmentation, breast tumor benign/malignant classification, and prostate cancer diagnosis as examples, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both public and in-house datasets.</p>

The bottleneck for efficacy, however, is how well these devices work in practice and how the elderly experience them, but research on this topic is scant. We review elderly use of voice-controlled AI and highlight various user- and technology-centered issues, that need to be considered before effective speech-controlled AI for elderly care can be realized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfang Li, Zetian Sun, Xinshuo Hu, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt to the continuous changes in data, tasks, and user preferences. Due to their massive size and the high costs associated with training, LLMs are not suitable for frequent retraining. However, updates are necessary to keep them in sync with rapidly evolving human knowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Compression Memory Training (CMT) method, an efficient and effective online adaptation framework for LLMs that features robust knowledge retention capabilities. Inspired by human memory mechanisms, CMT compresses and extracts information from new documents to be stored in a memory bank. When answering to queries related to these new documents, the model aggregates these document memories from the memory bank to better answer user questions. The parameters of the LLM itself do not change during training and inference, reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To enhance the encoding, retrieval, and aggregation of memory, we further propose three new general and flexible techniques, including memory-aware objective, self-matching and top-aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on three continual learning datasets (i.e., StreamingQA, SQuAD and ArchivalQA) demonstrate that the proposed method improves model adaptability and robustness across multiple base LLMs (e.g., +4.07 EM & +4.19 F1 in StreamingQA with Llama-2-7b).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunming Hui, Shihan Wang, Melisachew Wudage Chekol, Stevan Rudinac, Inez Maria Zwetsloot</p>
<p>Abstract: The influence maximization (IM) problem involves identifying a set of key individuals in a social network who can maximize the spread of influence through their network connections. With the advent of geometric deep learning on graphs, great progress has been made towards better solutions for the IM problem. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic non-progressive IM problem, which considers the dynamic nature of real-world social networks and the special case where the influence diffusion is non-progressive, i.e., nodes can be activated multiple times. We first extend an existing diffusion model to capture the non-progressive influence propagation in dynamic social networks. We then propose the method, DNIMRL, which employs deep reinforcement learning and dynamic graph embedding to solve the dynamic non-progressive IM problem. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm that effectively leverages graph embedding to capture the temporal changes of dynamic networks and seamlessly integrates with deep reinforcement learning. The experiments, on different types of real-world social network datasets, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Ma, Zihan Liang, Huangyu Dai, Ben Chen, Dehong Gao, Zhuoran Ran, Wang Zihan, Linbo Jin, Wen Jiang, Guannan Zhang, Xiaoyan Cai, Libin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for larger-scale models in the development of \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odels (LLMs) poses challenges for efficient training within limited computational resources. Traditional fine-tuning methods often exhibit instability in multi-task learning and rely heavily on extensive training resources. Here, we propose MoDULA (\textbf{M}ixture \textbf{o}f \textbf{D}omain-Specific and \textbf{U}niversal \textbf{L}oR\textbf{A}), a novel \textbf{P}arameter \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (PEFT) \textbf{M}ixture-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{E}xpert (MoE) paradigm for improved fine-tuning and parameter efficiency in multi-task learning. The paradigm effectively improves the multi-task capability of the model by training universal experts, domain-specific experts, and routers separately. MoDULA-Res is a new method within the MoDULA paradigm, which maintains the model's general capability by connecting universal and task-specific experts through residual connections. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res methods surpasses that of existing fine-tuning methods on various LLMs. Notably, MoDULA-Res achieves more significant performance improvements in multiple tasks while reducing training costs by over 80\% without losing general capability. Moreover, MoDULA displays flexible pluggability, allowing for the efficient addition of new tasks without retraining existing experts from scratch. This progressive training paradigm circumvents data balancing issues, enhancing training efficiency and model stability. Overall, MoDULA provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for fine-tuning LLMs with enhanced parameter efficiency and generalization capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihen Amara, Birgitta K\"onig-Ries, Sheeba Samuel</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has significantly advanced automatic plant disease detection through image-based classification, improving model explainability remains crucial for reliable disease detection. In this study, we apply the Automated Concept-based Explanation (ACE) method to plant disease classification using the widely adopted InceptionV3 model and the PlantVillage dataset. ACE automatically identifies the visual concepts found in the image data and provides insights about the critical features influencing the model predictions. This approach reveals both effective disease-related patterns and incidental biases, such as those from background or lighting that can compromise model robustness. Through systematic experiments, ACE helped us to identify relevant features and pinpoint areas for targeted model improvement. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ACE to improve the explainability of plant disease classification based on deep learning, which is essential for producing transparent tools for plant disease management in agriculture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying radar object detection models on resource-constrained edge devices like the Raspberry Pi poses significant challenges due to the large size of the model and the limited computational power and the memory of the Pi. In this work, we explore the efficiency of Depthwise Separable Convolutions in radar object detection networks and integrate them into our model.

With these innovations, we propose the DSFEC-L model and its two versions, which outperform the baseline (23.9 mAP of Car class, 20.72 GFLOPs) on nuScenes dataset: 1). An efficient DSFEC-M model with a 14.6% performance improvement and a 60% reduction in GFLOPs. 2). A deployable DSFEC-S model with a 3.76% performance improvement and a remarkable 78.5% reduction in GFLOPs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahan Bhatt, Nandan Vaghela, Kush Dudhia</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are essential for the functionality of GraphRAGs, a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generative Systems (RAGs) that excel in tasks requiring structured reasoning and semantic understanding. However, creating KGs for GraphRAGs remains a significant challenge due to accuracy and scalability limitations of traditional methods. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA 2 (13B), and BERT to generate KGs directly from unstructured data, bypassing traditional pipelines. Using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Graph Edit Distance, and Semantic Similarity, we evaluate the models' ability to generate high-quality KGs. Results demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves superior semantic fidelity and structural accuracy, LLaMA 2 excels in lightweight, domain-specific graphs, and BERT provides insights into challenges in entity-relationship modeling. This study underscores the potential of LLMs to streamline KG creation and enhance GraphRAG accessibility for real-world applications, while setting a foundation for future advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javad Seraj, Mohammad Mahdi Mohajeri, Mohammad Javad Dousti, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation by large language models (LLMs) is a prominent topic today; however, judgment and evaluation tasks are often subjective and influenced by various factors, making adaptation challenging. While many studies demonstrate the capabilities of state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs in comparison to human evaluators, they often struggle to adapt to reference evaluators over time, a requirement for achieving personalized judgment. Additionally, numerous works have attempted to apply open LLMs as judges or evaluators, but these efforts frequently overlook the limitations of working with scarce data. Personalized judgment is inherently associated with limited data scenarios, which are common in many real-world problems. Our work aims to present a data augmentation technique to select a more effective sample from limited data in order to align an open LLM with human preference. Our work achieves approximately 7% improvements in Pearson correlation with a reference judge over the baseline,and 30% improvement over the base model (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) in the mathematical reasoning evaluation task. demonstrating that augmenting selecting more effective preference data enables our approach to surpass baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kinshuk Vasisht, Navreet Kaur, Danish Pruthi</p>
<p>Abstract: To deploy language models safely, it is crucial that they abstain from responding to inappropriate requests. Several prior studies test the safety promises of models based on their effectiveness in blocking malicious requests. In this work, we focus on evaluating the underlying techniques that cause models to abstain. We create SELECT, a benchmark derived from a set of benign concepts (e.g., "rivers") from a knowledge graph. The nature of SELECT enables us to isolate the effects of abstention techniques from other safety training procedures, as well as evaluate their generalization and specificity. Using SELECT, we benchmark different abstention techniques over six open-weight and closed-source models. We find that the examined techniques indeed cause models to abstain with over $80\%$ abstention rates. However, these techniques are not as effective for descendants of the target concepts, with refusal rates declining by $19\%$. We also characterize the generalization-vs-specificity trade-offs for different techniques. Overall, no single technique is invariably better than the others. Our findings call for a careful evaluation of different aspects of abstention, and hopefully inform practitioners of various trade-offs involved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihua Liu, Jianhua Qiu, Said Boumaraf, Chaochao lin, Pan liyuan, Lin Li, Mohammed Bennamoun, Naoufel Werghi</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the growing threat of deepfake technology, we introduce BENet, a Cross-Domain Robust Bias Expansion Network. BENet enhances the detection of fake faces by addressing limitations in current detectors related to variations across different types of fake face generation techniques, where ``cross-domain" refers to the diverse range of these deepfakes, each considered a separate domain. BENet's core feature is a bias expansion module based on autoencoders. This module maintains genuine facial features while enhancing differences in fake reconstructions, creating a reliable bias for detecting fake faces across various deepfake domains. We also introduce a Latent-Space Attention (LSA) module to capture inconsistencies related to fake faces at different scales, ensuring robust defense against advanced deepfake techniques. The enriched LSA feature maps are multiplied with the expanded bias to create a versatile feature space optimized for subtle forgeries detection. To improve its ability to detect fake faces from unknown sources, BENet integrates a cross-domain detector module that enhances recognition accuracy by verifying the facial domain during inference. We train our network end-to-end with a novel bias expansion loss, adopted for the first time, in face forgery detection. Extensive experiments covering both intra and cross-dataset demonstrate BENet's superiority over current state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihua Liu, Said Boumaraf, Jianwu Li, Chaochao Lin, Xiabi Liu, Lijuan Niu, Naoufel Werghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural gradient descent (NGD) is a powerful optimization technique for machine learning, but the computational complexity of the inverse Fisher information matrix limits its application in training deep neural networks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel optimization method for training deep neural networks called structured natural gradient descent (SNGD). Theoretically, we demonstrate that optimizing the original network using NGD is equivalent to using fast gradient descent (GD) to optimize the reconstructed network with a structural transformation of the parameter matrix. Thereby, we decompose the calculation of the global Fisher information matrix into the efficient computation of local Fisher matrices via constructing local Fisher layers in the reconstructed network to speed up the training. Experimental results on various deep networks and datasets demonstrate that SNGD achieves faster convergence speed than NGD while retaining comparable solutions. Furthermore, our method outperforms traditional GDs in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Thus, our proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the scalability and efficiency of NGD in deep learning applications.

<p>Abstract: Federated learning enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, preserving data privacy. However, its vulnerability towards critical security threats, such as gradient inversion and model poisoning by malicious clients, remain unresolved. Existing solutions often address these issues separately, sacrificing either system robustness or model accuracy. This work introduces Tazza, a secure and efficient federated learning framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges. By leveraging the permutation equivariance and invariance properties of neural networks via weight shuffling and shuffled model validation, Tazza enhances resilience against diverse poisoning attacks, while ensuring data confidentiality and high model accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on various datasets and embedded platforms show that Tazza achieves robust defense with up to 6.7x improved computational efficiency compared to alternative schemes, without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhayy Ud Din, Jan Rosell, Waseem Akram, Isiah Zaplana, Maximo A Roa, Lakmal Seneviratne, Irfan Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Performing complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments requires efficient Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches, which combine high-level symbolic plan with low-level motion planning. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which struggles in adapting to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel ontology-driven prompt-tuning framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments, and the generation of semantically correct task plans.</p>

This paper presents an experimental study to predict vulnerabilities in binary code without source code or complex representations of the binary, leveraging the pivotal idea of decompiling the binary file through neural decompilation and predicting vulnerabilities through deep learning on the decompiled source code. The results outperform the state-of-the-art in both neural decompilation and vulnerability prediction, showing that it is possible to identify vulnerable programs with this approach concerning bi-class (vulnerable/non-vulnerable) and multi-class (type of vulnerability) analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven finite volume method for solving 1D and 2D hyperbolic partial differential equations. This work builds upon the prior research incorporating a data-driven finite-difference approximation of smooth solutions of scalar conservation laws, where optimal coefficients of neural networks approximating space derivatives are learned based on accurate, but cumbersome solutions to these equations. We extend this approach to flux-limited finite volume schemes for hyperbolic scalar and systems of conservation laws. We also train the discretization to efficiently capture discontinuous solutions with shock and contact waves, as well as to the application of boundary conditions. The learning procedure of the data-driven model is extended through the definition of a new loss, paddings and adequate database. These new ingredients guarantee computational stability, preserve the accuracy of fine-grid solutions, and enhance overall performance. Numerical experiments using test cases from the literature in both one- and two-dimensional spaces demonstrate that the learned model accurately reproduces fine-grid results on very coarse meshes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video diffusion models have achieved impressive realism and controllability but are limited by high computational demands, restricting their use on mobile devices. This paper introduces the first mobile-optimized video diffusion model.

Furthermore, we employ adversarial finetuning to reduce the denoising to a single step. Our model, coined as MobileVD, is 523x more efficient (1817.2 vs. 4.34 TFLOPs) with a slight quality drop (FVD 149 vs. 171), generating latents for a 14x512x256 px clip in 1.7 seconds on a Xiaomi-14 Pro.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quoc-Bao Nguyen-Le, Thanh-Huy Le-Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current video retrieval systems, especially those used in competitions, primarily focus on querying individual keyframes or images rather than encoding an entire clip or video segment. However, queries often describe an action or event over a series of frames, not a specific image. This results in insufficient information when analyzing a single frame, leading to less accurate query results. Moreover, extracting embeddings solely from images (keyframes) does not provide enough information for models to encode higher-level, more abstract insights inferred from the video. These models tend to only describe the objects present in the frame, lacking a deeper understanding. In this work, we propose a system that integrates the latest methodologies, introducing a novel pipeline that extracts multimodal data, and incorporate information from multiple frames within a video, enabling the model to abstract higher-level information that captures latent meanings, focusing on what can be inferred from the video clip, rather than just focusing on object detection in one single image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Zivic, Hernan Vazquez, Jorge Sanchez</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling user preferences has been mainly addressed by looking at users' interaction history with the different elements available in the system. Tailoring content to individual preferences based on historical data is the main goal of sequential recommendation.
  The nature of the problem, as well as the good performance observed across various domains, has motivated the use of the transformer architecture, which has proven effective in leveraging increasingly larger amounts of training data when accompanied by an increase in the number of model parameters. This scaling behavior has brought a great deal of attention, as it provides valuable guidance in the design and training of even larger models.
  Taking inspiration from the scaling laws observed in training large language models, we explore similar principles for sequential recommendation.
  We use the full Amazon Product Data dataset, which has only been partially explored in other studies, and reveal scaling behaviors similar to those found in language models. Compute-optimal training is possible but requires a careful analysis of the compute-performance trade-offs specific to the application.
  We also show that performance scaling translates to downstream tasks by fine-tuning larger pre-trained models on smaller task-specific domains. Our approach and findings provide a strategic roadmap for model training and deployment in real high-dimensional preference spaces, facilitating better training and inference efficiency.
  We hope this paper bridges the gap between the potential of transformers and the intrinsic complexities of high-dimensional sequential recommendation in real-world recommender systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjin Lee, Kyumin Kim, Sungjae Lee, Jihun Lee, Kwang In KIm</p>
<p>Abstract: Applying language models (LMs) to tables is challenging due to the inherent structural differences between two-dimensional tables and one-dimensional text for which the LMs were originally designed. Furthermore, when applying linearized tables to LMs, the maximum token lengths often imposed in self-attention calculations make it difficult to comprehensively understand the context spread across large tables. To address these challenges, we present PieTa (Piece of Table), a new framework for sub-table-based question answering (QA). PieTa operates through an iterative process of dividing tables into smaller windows, using LMs to select relevant cells within each window, and merging these cells into a sub-table. This multi-resolution approach captures dependencies across multiple rows and columns while avoiding the limitations caused by long context inputs. Instantiated as a simple iterative sub-table union algorithm, PieTa demonstrates improved performance over previous sub-table-based QA approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Omar Faruque, Peter Jamieson, Ahmad Patooghy, Abdel-Hameed A. Badawy</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Hardware Trojans (HT) detection methods face several critical limitations: logic testing struggles with scalability and coverage for large designs, side-channel analysis requires golden reference chips, and formal verification methods suffer from state-space explosion. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising new direction for HT detection by leveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. For the first time, this paper explores the potential of general-purpose LLMs in detecting various HTs inserted in Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, including SRAM, AES, and UART modules. We propose a novel tool for this goal that systematically assesses state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 pro, and Llama 3.1) in detecting HTs without prior fine-tuning. To address potential training data bias, the tool implements perturbation techniques, i.e., variable name obfuscation, and design restructuring, that make the cases more sophisticated for the used LLMs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates perfect detection rates by GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 pro in baseline scenarios (100%/100% precision/recall), with both models achieving better trigger line coverage (TLC: 0.82-0.98) than payload line coverage (PLC: 0.32-0.46). Under code perturbation, while Gemini 1.5 pro maintains perfect detection performance (100%/100%), GPT-4o (100%/85.7%) and Llama 3.1 (66.7%/85.7%) show some degradation in detection rates, and all models experience decreased accuracy in localizing both triggers and payloads. This paper validates the potential of LLM approaches for hardware security applications, highlighting areas for future improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubhav Jain, Yuya Kobayashi, Takashi Shibuya, Yuhta Takida, Nasir Memon, Julian Togelius, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Greg Heinrich (Danny), Mike Ranzinger (Danny),  Hongxu (Danny),  Yin, Yao Lu, Jan Kautz, Andrew Tao, Bryan Catanzaro, Pavlo Molchanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Agglomerative models have recently emerged as a powerful approach to training vision foundation models, leveraging multi-teacher distillation from existing models such as CLIP, DINO, and SAM. This strategy enables the efficient creation of robust models, combining the strengths of individual teachers while significantly reducing computational and resource demands. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze state-of-the-art agglomerative models, identifying critical challenges including resolution mode shifts, teacher imbalance, idiosyncratic teacher artifacts, and an excessive number of output tokens. To address these issues, we propose several novel solutions: multi-resolution training, mosaic augmentation, and improved balancing of teacher loss functions. Specifically, in the context of Vision Language Models, we introduce a token compression technique to maintain high-resolution information within a fixed token count. We release our top-performing models, available in multiple scales (-B, -L, -H, and -g), alongside inference code and pretrained weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Bayat, Mohammad Pezeshki, Elvis Dohmatob, David Lopez-Paz, Pascal Vincent</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks often learn simple explanations that fit the majority of the data while memorizing exceptions that deviate from these explanations.This behavior leads to poor generalization when the learned explanations rely on spurious correlations. In this work, we formalize the interplay between memorization and generalization, showing that spurious correlations would particularly lead to poor generalization when are combined with memorization. Memorization can reduce training loss to zero, leaving no incentive to learn robust, generalizable patterns. To address this, we propose memorization-aware training (MAT), which uses held-out predictions as a signal of memorization to shift a model's logits. MAT encourages learning robust patterns invariant across distributions, improving generalization under distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas N\"u{\ss}lein, Maximilian Zorn, Fabian Ritz, Jonas Stein, Gerhard Stenzel, Julian Sch\"onberger, Thomas Gabor, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies are designed to predict actions based on current observations to maximize cumulative future rewards. In real-world applications (i.e., non-simulated environments), sensors are essential for measuring the current state and providing the observations on which RL policies rely to make decisions. A significant challenge in deploying RL policies in real-world scenarios is handling sensor dropouts, which can result from hardware malfunctions, physical damage, or environmental factors like dust on a camera lens. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is the use of backup sensors, though this comes with added costs. This paper explores the optimization of backup sensor configurations to maximize expected returns while keeping costs below a specified threshold, C. Our approach uses a second-order approximation of expected returns and includes penalties for exceeding cost constraints. We then optimize this quadratic program using Tabu Search, a meta-heuristic algorithm. The approach is evaluated across eight OpenAI Gym environments and a custom Unity-based robotic environment (RobotArmGrasping). Empirical results demonstrate that our quadratic program effectively approximates real expected returns, facilitating the identification of optimal sensor configurations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Novel-view synthesis techniques achieve impressive results for static scenes but struggle when faced with the inconsistencies inherent to casual capture settings: varying illumination, scene motion, and other unintended effects that are difficult to model explicitly. We present an approach for leveraging generative video models to simulate the inconsistencies in the world that can occur during capture. We use this process, along with existing multi-view datasets, to create synthetic data for training a multi-view harmonization network that is able to reconcile inconsistent observations into a consistent 3D scene. We demonstrate that our world-simulation strategy significantly outperforms traditional augmentation methods in handling real-world scene variations, thereby enabling highly accurate static 3D reconstructions in the presence of a variety of challenging inconsistencies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puja Maharjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Citation recommendation systems have attracted much academic interest, resulting in many studies and implementations. These systems help authors automatically generate proper citations by suggesting relevant references based on the text they have written. However, the methods used in citation recommendation differ across various studies and implementations. Some approaches focus on the overall content of papers, while others consider the context of the citation text. Additionally, the datasets used in these studies include different aspects of papers, such as metadata, citation context, or even the full text of the paper in various formats and structures. The diversity in models, datasets, and evaluation metrics makes it challenging to assess and compare citation recommendation methods effectively. To address this issue, a standardized dataset and evaluation metrics are needed to evaluate these models consistently. Therefore, we propose developing a benchmark specifically designed to analyze and compare citation recommendation models. This benchmark will evaluate the performance of models on different features of the citation context and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models across all these tasks, presenting the results in a standardized way. By creating a benchmark with standardized evaluation metrics, researchers and practitioners in the field of citation recommendation will have a common platform to assess and compare different models. This will enable meaningful comparisons and help identify promising approaches for further research and development in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has changed the game for real-time photo-realistic rendering. One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to create animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed the boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main limitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as a webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a Gaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or video and fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports 360$^\circ$ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference, enabling real-time application. Through our method, we obtain high-quality, animatable Avatars from limited data which can be animated and rendered at 70fps on commercial hardware.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging machine learning for homeless service assignment. However, the categorical nature of administrative data recorded for homeless individuals hinders the development of accurate machine learning methods for this task. This work asserts that deriving latent representations of such features, while at the same time leveraging underlying relationships between instances is crucial in algorithmically enhancing the existing assignment decision-making process. Our proposed approach learns temporal and functional relationships between services from historical data, as well as unobserved but relevant relationships between individuals to generate features that significantly improve the prediction of the next service assignment compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Korbinian P\"oppel, Maximilian Beck, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Nazarieh, Zhenhua Feng, Diptesh Kanojia, Muhammad Awais, Josef Kittler</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation is a challenging task in digital communication. Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods concentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as visual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing realistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, customizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named PortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework consisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is designed to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video frames, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion consistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference images, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in existing approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of text prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly expands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive experiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces suitable for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial perception is a fundamental component of intelligence. While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only test for static spatial reasoning, such as categorizing the relative positions of objects. Meanwhile, real-world deployment requires dynamic capabilities like perspective-taking and egocentric action recognition. As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K question-answer pairs for 22K synthetic scenes across a training and testing set. Generated using a photo-realistic physics engine, our dataset can be arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets. We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT, but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks: $23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning. Our data/code is available at http://arijitray1993.github.io/SAT/ .</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots require both robust lower-body locomotion and precise upper-body manipulation. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches provide whole-body loco-manipulation policies, they lack precise manipulation with high DoF arms. In this paper, we propose decoupling upper-body control from locomotion, using inverse kinematics (IK) and motion retargeting for precise manipulation, while RL focuses on robust lower-body locomotion. We introduce PMP (Predictive Motion Priors), trained with Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to effectively represent upper-body motions. The locomotion policy is trained conditioned on this upper-body motion representation, ensuring that the system remains robust with both manipulation and locomotion. We show that CVAE features are crucial for stability and robustness, and significantly outperforms RL-based whole-body control in precise manipulation. With precise upper-body motion and robust lower-body locomotion control, operators can remotely control the humanoid to walk around and explore different environments, while performing diverse manipulation tasks.</p>

By employing a blind method for drift management, the algorithm adjusts the embedding space, which facilitates the visualisation of evolving data dynamics.

<p>Abstract: Numerous fairness metrics have been proposed and employed by artificial intelligence (AI) experts to quantitatively measure bias and define fairness in AI models. Recognizing the need to accommodate stakeholders' diverse fairness understandings, efforts are underway to solicit their input. However, conveying AI fairness metrics to stakeholders without AI expertise, capturing their personal preferences, and seeking a collective consensus remain challenging and underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework, EARN Fairness, which facilitates collective metric decisions among stakeholders without requiring AI expertise. The framework features an adaptable interactive system and a stakeholder-centered EARN Fairness process to Explain fairness metrics, Ask stakeholders' personal metric preferences, Review metrics collectively, and Negotiate a consensus on metric selection. To gather empirical results, we applied the framework to a credit rating scenario and conducted a user study involving 18 decision subjects without AI knowledge. We identify their personal metric preferences and their acceptable level of unfairness in individual sessions. Subsequently, we uncovered how they reached metric consensus in team sessions. Our work shows that the EARN Fairness framework enables stakeholders to express personal preferences and reach consensus, providing practical guidance for implementing human-centered AI fairness in high-risk contexts. Through this approach, we aim to harmonize fairness expectations of diverse stakeholders, fostering more equitable and inclusive AI fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient communication can enhance the overall performance of collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning. A common approach is to share observations through full communication, leading to significant communication overhead. Existing work attempts to perceive the global state by conducting teammate model based on local information. However, they ignore that the uncertainty generated by prediction may lead to difficult training. To address this problem, we propose a Demand-aware Customized Multi-Agent Communication (DCMAC) protocol, which use an upper bound training to obtain the ideal policy. By utilizing the demand parsing module, agent can interpret the gain of sending local message on teammate, and generate customized messages via compute the correlation between demands and local observation using cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, our method can adapt to the communication resources of agents and accelerate the training progress by appropriating the ideal policy which is trained with joint observation. Experimental results reveal that DCMAC significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in both unconstrained and communication constrained scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a standard model for sequential decision-making problems and are widely used across many scientific areas, including formal methods and artificial intelligence (AI). MDPs do, however, come with the restrictive assumption that the transition probabilities need to be precisely known. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) overcome this assumption by instead defining the transition probabilities to belong to some uncertainty set. We present a gentle survey on RMDPs, providing a tutorial covering their fundamentals. In particular, we discuss RMDP semantics and how to solve them by extending standard MDP methods such as value iteration and policy iteration. We also discuss how RMDPs relate to other models and how they are used in several contexts, including reinforcement learning and abstraction techniques. We conclude with some challenges for future work on RMDPs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Sadeq Abolhasani, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting relevant and structured knowledge from large, complex technical documents within the Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) domain is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our work addresses this challenge by presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chujie Zheng, Zhenru Zhang, Beichen Zhang, Runji Lin, Keming Lu, Bowen Yu, Dayiheng Liu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daoan Zhang, Chenming Li, Haoquan Li, Wenjian Huang, Lingyun Huang, Jianguo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised image semantic segmentation(UISS) aims to match low-level visual features with semantic-level representations without outer supervision. In this paper, we address the critical properties from the view of feature alignments and feature uniformity for UISS models. We also make a comparison between UISS and image-wise representation learning. Based on the analysis, we argue that the existing MI-based methods in UISS suffer from representation collapse. By this, we proposed a robust network called Semantic Attention Network(SAN), in which a new module Semantic Attention(SEAT) is proposed to generate pixel-wise and semantic features dynamically. Experimental results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks show that our unsupervised segmentation framework specializes in catching semantic representations, which outperforms all the unpretrained and even several pretrained methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyan Su, Zhiheng Zhang, Jiyan Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) is to identify the seed set to maximize information dissemination in a network. Elegant IM algorithms could naturally extend to cases where each node is equipped with a specific weight, reflecting individual gains to measure the node's importance. Prevailing literature typically assumes such individual gains remain constant throughout the cascade process and are solvable through explicit formulas based on the node's characteristics and network topology. However, this assumption is not always feasible for two reasons: 1)Unobservability: The individual gains of each node are primarily evaluated by the difference between the outputs in the activated and non-activated states. In practice, we can only observe one of these states, with the other remaining unobservable post-propagation. 2)Environmental sensitivity: In addition to the node's inherent properties, individual gains are also sensitive to the activation status of surrounding nodes, which is dynamic during iteration even when the network topology remains static. To address these challenges, we extend the consideration of IM to a broader scenario with dynamic node individual gains, leveraging causality techniques. In our paper, we introduce a Causal Influence Maximization (CauIM) framework and develop two algorithms, G-CauIM and A-CauIM, where the latter incorporates a novel acceleration technique. Theoretically, we establish the generalized lower bound of influence spread and provide robustness analysis. Empirically, in synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongqi Liu, Yifan Wang, Vera Demberg</p>
<p>Abstract: For text summarization, the role of discourse structure is pivotal in discerning the core content of a text. Regrettably, prior studies on incorporating Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) into transformer-based summarization models only consider the nuclearity annotation, thereby overlooking the variety of discourse relation types. This paper introduces the 'RSTformer', a novel summarization model that comprehensively incorporates both the types and uncertainty of rhetorical relations. Our RST-attention mechanism, rooted in document-level rhetorical structure, is an extension of the recently devised Longformer framework. Through rigorous evaluation, the model proposed herein exhibits significant superiority over state-of-the-art models, as evidenced by its notable performance on several automatic metrics and human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Jiang, Cao Xiao, Tianfan Fu, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout, Jimeng Sun, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular representation learning is vital for various downstream applications, including the analysis and prediction of molecular properties and side effects. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a popular framework for modeling molecular data, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called GODE, which accounts for the dual-level structure inherent in molecules. Molecules possess an intrinsic graph structure and simultaneously function as nodes within a broader molecular knowledge graph. GODE integrates individual molecular graph representations with multi-domain biochemical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two GNNs on different graph structures and employing contrastive learning, GODE effectively fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion yields a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property predictions by leveraging both chemical and biological information. When fine-tuned across 11 chemical property tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 12.7% for classification tasks and an average RMSE/MAE improvement of 34.4% for regression tasks. Notably, GODE surpasses the current leading model in property prediction, with advancements of 2.2% in classification and 7.2% in regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Fel, Thibaut Boissin, Victor Boutin, Agustin Picard, Paul Novello, Julien Colin, Drew Linsley, Tom Rousseau, R\'emi Cad\`ene, Lore Goetschalckx, Laurent Gardes, Thomas Serre</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature visualization has gained substantial popularity, particularly after the influential work by Olah et al. in 2017, which established it as a crucial tool for explainability. However, its widespread adoption has been limited due to a reliance on tricks to generate interpretable images, and corresponding challenges in scaling it to deeper neural networks. Here, we describe MACO, a simple approach to address these shortcomings. The main idea is to generate images by optimizing the phase spectrum while keeping the magnitude constant to ensure that generated explanations lie in the space of natural images. Our approach yields significantly better results (both qualitatively and quantitatively) and unlocks efficient and interpretable feature visualizations for large state-of-the-art neural networks. We also show that our approach exhibits an attribution mechanism allowing us to augment feature visualizations with spatial importance. We validate our method on a novel benchmark for comparing feature visualization methods, and release its visualizations for all classes of the ImageNet dataset on https://serre-lab.github.io/Lens/.
  Overall, our approach unlocks, for the first time, feature visualizations for large, state-of-the-art deep neural networks without resorting to any parametric prior image model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale language models, like ChatGPT, have garnered significant media attention and stunned the public with their remarkable capacity for generating coherent text from short natural language prompts. In this paper, we aim to conduct a systematic inspection of ChatGPT's performance in two controllable generation tasks, with respect to ChatGPT's ability to adapt its output to different target audiences (expert vs. layman) and writing styles (formal vs. informal). Additionally, we evaluate the faithfulness of the generated text, and compare the model's performance with human-authored texts. Our findings indicate that the stylistic variations produced by humans are considerably larger than those demonstrated by ChatGPT, and the generated texts diverge from human samples in several characteristics, such as the distribution of word types. Moreover, we observe that ChatGPT sometimes incorporates factual errors or hallucinations when adapting the text to suit a specific style.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charles Guille-Escuret, Pierre-Andr\'e No\"el, Ioannis Mitliagkas, David Vazquez, Joao Monteiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Li, Xianlong Wang, Zhifei Yu, Shengshan Hu, Ziqi Zhou, Longling Zhang, Leo Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolution-based unlearnable examples (UEs) employ class-wise multiplicative convolutional noise to training samples, severely compromising model performance. This fire-new type of UEs have successfully countered all defense mechanisms against UEs. The failure of such defenses can be attributed to the absence of norm constraints on convolutional noise, leading to severe blurring of image features. To address this, we first design an Edge Pixel-based Detector (EPD) to identify convolution-based UEs. Upon detection of them, we propose the first defense scheme against convolution-based UEs, COrrupting these samples via random matrix multiplication by employing bilinear INterpolation (COIN) such that disrupting the distribution of class-wise multiplicative noise. To evaluate the generalization of our proposed COIN, we newly design two convolution-based UEs called VUDA and HUDA to expand the scope of convolution-based UEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of detection scheme EPD and that our defense COIN outperforms 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, achieving a significant improvement on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Kangbo Liu, Yaoxin Wu, Zhaoxuan Wang, Erik Cambria, Xiaoxu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bundle recommendations strive to offer users a set of items as a package named bundle, enhancing convenience and contributing to the seller's revenue. While previous approaches have demonstrated notable performance, we argue that they may compromise the ternary relationship among users, items, and bundles. This compromise can result in information loss, ultimately impacting the overall model performance. To address this gap, we develop a unified model for bundle recommendation, termed hypergraph-enhanced dual convolutional neural network (HED). Our approach is characterized by two key aspects. Firstly, we construct a complete hypergraph to capture interaction dynamics among users, items, and bundles. Secondly, we incorporate U-B interaction information to enhance the information representation derived from users and bundle embedding vectors. Extensive experimental results on the Youshu and Netease datasets have demonstrated that HED surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, proving its effectiveness. In addition, various ablation studies and sensitivity analyses revealed the working mechanism and proved our effectiveness. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/AAI-Lab/HED</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial fine-tuning methods enhance adversarial robustness via fine-tuning the pre-trained model in an adversarial training manner. However, we identify that some specific latent features of adversarial samples are confused by adversarial perturbation and lead to an unexpectedly increasing gap between features in the last hidden layer of natural and adversarial samples. To address this issue, we propose a disentanglement-based approach to explicitly model and further remove the specific latent features. We introduce a feature disentangler to separate out the specific latent features from the features of the adversarial samples, thereby boosting robustness by eliminating the specific latent features. Besides, we align clean features in the pre-trained model with features of adversarial samples in the fine-tuned model, to benefit from the intrinsic features of natural samples. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing adversarial fine-tuning methods and adversarial training baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Liang, Youzhi Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing through its exceptional performance on numerous tasks. Yet, the majority of researchers have mainly concentrated on enhancements related to the model structure, such as relative position embedding and more efficient attention mechanisms. Others have delved into pretraining tricks associated with Masked Language Modeling, including whole word masking. DeBERTa introduced an enhanced decoder adapted for BERT's encoder model for pretraining, proving to be highly effective. We argue that the design and research around enhanced masked language modeling decoders have been underappreciated. In this paper, we propose several designs of enhanced decoders and introduce BPDec (BERT Pretraining Decoder), a novel method for modeling training. Typically, a pretrained BERT model is fine-tuned for specific Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. In our approach, we utilize the original BERT model as the encoder, making only changes to the decoder without altering the encoder. This approach does not necessitate extensive modifications to the encoder architecture and can be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning pipelines and services, offering an efficient and effective enhancement strategy. Compared to other methods, while we also incur a moderate training cost for the decoder during the pretraining process, our approach does not introduce additional training costs during the fine-tuning phase. We test multiple enhanced decoder structures after pretraining and evaluate their performance on the GLUE tasks and SQuAD tasks. Our results demonstrate that BPDec, having only undergone subtle refinements to the model structure during pretraining, significantly enhances model performance without escalating the finetuning cost, inference time and serving budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqing Sun, Longhui Yu, Yikang Shen, Weiyang Liu, Yiming Yang, Sean Welleck, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current AI alignment methodologies rely on human-provided demonstrations or judgments, and the learned capabilities of AI systems would be upper-bounded by human capabilities as a result. This raises a challenging research question: How can we keep improving the systems when their capabilities have surpassed the levels of humans? This paper answers this question in the context of tackling hard reasoning tasks (e.g., level 4-5 MATH problems) via learning from human annotations on easier tasks (e.g., level 1-3 MATH problems), which we term as easy-to-hard generalization. Our key insight is that an evaluator (reward model) trained on supervisions for easier tasks can be effectively used for scoring candidate solutions of harder tasks and hence facilitating easy-to-hard generalization over different levels of tasks. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach to scalable alignment, which firstly trains the (process-supervised) reward models on easy problems (e.g., level 1-3), and then uses them to evaluate the performance of policy models on hard problems. We show that such easy-to-hard generalization from evaluators can enable easy-to-hard generalizations in generators either through re-ranking or reinforcement learning (RL). Notably, our process-supervised 7b RL model and 34b model (reranking@1024) achieves an accuracy of 34.0% and 52.5% on MATH500, respectively, despite only using human supervision on easy problems. Our approach suggests a promising path toward AI systems that advance beyond the frontier of human supervision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) training paradigm where clients own their data and collaborate to train a global model, without revealing any data to the server and other participants. Researchers commonly perform experiments in a simulation environment to quickly iterate on ideas. However, existing open-source tools do not offer the efficiency required to simulate FL on larger and more realistic FL datasets. We introduce pfl-research, a fast, modular, and easy-to-use Python framework for simulating FL. It supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and non-neural network models, and is tightly integrated with state-of-the-art privacy algorithms. We study the speed of open-source FL frameworks and show that pfl-research is 7-72$\times$ faster than alternative open-source frameworks on common cross-device setups. Such speedup will significantly boost the productivity of the FL research community and enable testing hypotheses on realistic FL datasets that were previously too resource intensive. We release a suite of benchmarks that evaluates an algorithm's overall performance on a diverse set of realistic scenarios.

<p>Abstract: For long document summarization, discourse structure is important to discern the key content of the text and the differences in importance level between sentences. Unfortunately, the integration of rhetorical structure theory (RST) into parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for long document summarization remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper introduces RST-LoRA and proposes four RST-aware variants to explicitly incorporate RST into the LoRA model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that incorporating the type and uncertainty of rhetorical relations can complementarily enhance the performance of LoRA in summarization tasks. Furthermore, the best-performing variant we introduced outperforms the vanilla LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning models, as confirmed by multiple automatic and human evaluations, and even surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Jia, Yipei Wang, Yan Li, Honggang Chen, Xuehan Bai, Zhaocheng Liu, Jian Liang, Quan Chen, Han Li, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems predominantly rely on ID embedding to capture latent associations among users and items. However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalizations. Leveraging the capability of large language models to comprehend and reason about textual content presents a promising avenue for advancing recommendation systems. To achieve this, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through experiments on the real large-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in industry application. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on six Amazon Review datasets to verify the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Walid Saad, Merouane Debbah, Choong Seon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: The large communication and computation overhead of federated learning (FL) is one of the main challenges facing its practical deployment over resource-constrained clients and systems. In this work, SpaFL: a communication-efficient FL framework is proposed to optimize sparse model structures with low computational overhead. In SpaFL, a trainable threshold is defined for each filter/neuron to prune its all connected parameters, thereby leading to structured sparsity. To optimize the pruning process itself, only thresholds are communicated between a server and clients instead of parameters, thereby learning how to prune. Further, global thresholds are used to update model parameters by extracting aggregated parameter importance. The generalization bound of SpaFL is also derived, thereby proving key insights on the relation between sparsity and performance. Experimental results show that SpaFL improves accuracy while requiring much less communication and computing resources compared to sparse baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reid McIlroy-Young, Katrina Brown, Conlan Olson, Linjun Zhang, Cynthia Dwork</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of generative language models that can create long and coherent textual outputs via autoregression has lead to a proliferation of uses and a corresponding sweep of analyses as researches work to determine the limitations of this new paradigm. Unlike humans, these 'Large Language Models' (LLMs) are highly sensitive to small changes in their inputs, leading to unwanted inconsistency in their behavior. One problematic inconsistency when LLMs are used to answer multiple-choice questions or analyze multiple inputs is order dependency: the output of an LLM can (and often does) change significantly when sub-sequences are swapped, despite both orderings being semantically identical. In this paper we present Set-Based Prompting, a technique that guarantees the output of an LLM will not have order dependence on a specified set of sub-sequences. We show that this method provably eliminates order dependency, and that it can be applied to any transformer-based LLM to enable text generation that is unaffected by re-orderings. Delving into the implications of our method, we show that, despite our inputs being out of distribution, the impact on expected accuracy is small, where the expectation is over the order of uniformly chosen shuffling of the candidate responses, and usually significantly less in practice. Thus, Set-Based Prompting can be used as a 'dropped-in' method on fully trained models. Finally, we discuss how our method's success suggests that other strong guarantees can be obtained on LLM performance via modifying the input representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Pacini, Xiaowen Dong, Bruno Lepri, Gabriele Santin</p>
<p>Abstract: The separation power of a machine learning model refers to its ability to distinguish between different inputs and is often used as a proxy for its expressivity. Indeed, knowing the separation power of a family of models is a necessary condition to obtain fine-grained universality results. In this paper, we analyze the separation power of equivariant neural networks, such as convolutional and permutation-invariant networks. We first present a complete characterization of inputs indistinguishable by models derived by a given architecture. From this results, we derive how separability is influenced by hyperparameters and architectural choices-such as activation functions, depth, hidden layer width, and representation types. Notably, all non-polynomial activations, including ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in expressivity and reach maximum separation power. Depth improves separation power up to a threshold, after which further increases have no effect. Adding invariant features to hidden representations does not impact separation power. Finally, block decomposition of hidden representations affects separability, with minimal components forming a hierarchy in separation power that provides a straightforward method for comparing the separation power of models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyan Zhao, Tung Nguyen, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning is a key paradigm in large language models (LLMs) that enables them to generalize to new tasks and domains by simply prompting these models with a few exemplars without explicit parameter updates. Many attempts have been made to understand in-context learning in LLMs as a function of model scale, pretraining data, and other factors. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to probe and understand in-context learning from the lens of decision boundaries for in-context binary classification. Decision boundaries are straightforward to visualize and provide important information about the qualitative behavior of the inductive biases of standard classifiers. To our surprise, we find that the decision boundaries learned by current LLMs in simple binary classification tasks are often irregular and non-smooth, regardless of linear separability in the underlying task. This paper investigates the factors influencing these decision boundaries and explores methods to enhance their generalizability. We assess various approaches, including training-free and fine-tuning methods for LLMs, the impact of model architecture, and the effectiveness of active prompting techniques for smoothing decision boundaries in a data-efficient manner. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of in-context learning dynamics and offer practical improvements for enhancing robustness and generalizability of in-context learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Zhang, Ziqian Zeng, Yuxiang Xiao, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen, James Foulds, Shimei Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating content that exhibits gender biases, raising significant ethical concerns. Alignment, the process of fine-tuning LLMs to better align with desired behaviors, is recognized as an effective approach to mitigate gender biases. Although proprietary LLMs have made significant strides in mitigating gender bias, their alignment datasets are not publicly available. The commonly used and publicly available alignment dataset, HH-RLHF, still exhibits gender bias to some extent. There is a lack of publicly available alignment datasets specifically designed to address gender bias. Hence, we developed a new dataset named GenderAlign, aiming at mitigating a comprehensive set of gender biases in LLMs. This dataset comprises 8k single-turn dialogues, each paired with a "chosen" and a "rejected" response. Compared to the "rejected" responses, the "chosen" responses demonstrate lower levels of gender bias and higher quality. Furthermore, we categorized the gender biases in the "rejected" responses of GenderAlign into 4 principal categories. The experimental results show the effectiveness of GenderAlign in reducing gender bias in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Cheng, Yida Lu, Xiaotao Gu, Pei Ke, Xiao Liu, Yuxiao Dong, Hongning Wang, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, they still exhibit significant but subtle weaknesses, such as mistakes in instruction-following or coding tasks. As these unexpected errors could lead to severe consequences in practical deployments, it is crucial to investigate the limitations within LLMs systematically. Traditional benchmarking approaches cannot thoroughly pinpoint specific model deficiencies, while manual inspections are costly and not scalable. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework, AutoDetect, to automatically expose weaknesses in LLMs across various tasks. Inspired by the educational assessment process that measures students' learning outcomes, AutoDetect consists of three LLM-powered agents: Examiner, Questioner, and Assessor. The collaboration among these three agents is designed to realize comprehensive and in-depth weakness identification. Our framework demonstrates significant success in uncovering flaws, with an identification success rate exceeding 30% in prominent models such as ChatGPT and Claude. More importantly, these identified weaknesses can guide specific model improvements, proving more effective than untargeted data augmentation methods like Self-Instruct. Our approach has led to substantial enhancements in popular LLMs, including the Llama series and Mistral-7b, boosting their performance by over 10% across several benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christof Tinnes, Alisa Welter, Sven Apel</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling structure and behavior of software systems plays a crucial role in the industrial practice of software engineering. As with other software engineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supporting modelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completions is still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach, RAMC, leveraging large language models, model histories, and retrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments on three datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-source community dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated model repositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for model completion with RAMC. We found that large language models are indeed a promising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30% semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19% type-correct completions). The general inference capabilities of large language models are particularly useful when dealing with concepts for which there are few, noisy, or no examples at all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Maya Okawa, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern generative models demonstrate impressive capabilities, likely stemming from an ability to identify and manipulate abstract concepts underlying their training data. However, fundamental questions remain: what determines the concepts a model learns, the order in which it learns them, and its ability to manipulate those concepts? To address these questions, we propose analyzing a model's learning dynamics via a framework we call the concept space, where each axis represents an independent concept underlying the data generating process. By characterizing learning dynamics in this space, we identify how the speed at which a concept is learned, and hence the order of concept learning, is controlled by properties of the data we term concept signal. Further, we observe moments of sudden turns in the direction of a model's learning dynamics in concept space. Surprisingly, these points precisely correspond to the emergence of hidden capabilities, i.e., where latent interventions show the model possesses the capability to manipulate a concept, but these capabilities cannot yet be elicited via naive input prompting. While our results focus on synthetically defined toy datasets, we hypothesize a general claim on emergence of hidden capabilities may hold: generative models possess latent capabilities that emerge suddenly and consistently during training, though a model might not exhibit these capabilities under naive input prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Liu, Siqi Cai, Qihua Zhou, Song Guo, Ruibin Li, Kaiwei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) against gradient leakage attacks, where the private training data can be recovered from the exchanged gradients, making gradient protection a critical issue for the FL training process. Existing solutions often resort to perturbation-based mechanisms, such as differential privacy, where each participating client injects a specific amount of noise into local gradients before aggregating to the server, and the global distribution variation finally conceals the gradient privacy. However, perturbation is not always the panacea for gradient protection since the robustness heavily relies on the injected noise. This intuition raises an interesting question: \textit{is it possible to deactivate existing protection mechanisms by removing the perturbation inside the gradients?} In this paper, we present the answer: \textit{yes} and propose the Perturbation-resilient Gradient Leakage Attack (PGLA), the first attempt to recover the perturbed gradients, without additional access to the original model structure or third-party data. Specifically, we leverage the inherent diffusion property of gradient perturbation protection and construct a novel diffusion-based denoising model to implement PGLA. Our insight is that capturing the disturbance level of perturbation during the diffusion reverse process can release the gradient denoising capability, which promotes the diffusion model to generate approximate gradients as the original clean version through adaptive sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGLA effectively recovers the protected gradients and exposes the FL training process to the threat of gradient leakage, achieving the best quality in gradient denoising and data recovery compared to existing models. We hope to arouse public attention on PGLA and its defense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacy St\k{e}pka, Mateusz Lango, Jerzy Stefanowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) guide users on how to adjust inputs to machine learning models to achieve desired outputs. While existing research primarily addresses static scenarios, real-world applications often involve data or model changes, potentially invalidating previously generated CFEs and rendering user-induced input changes ineffective. Current methods addressing this issue often support only specific models or change types, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, or fail to provide probabilistic guarantees on CFE robustness to model changes. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating CFEs that provides probabilistic guarantees for any model and change type, while offering interpretable and easy-to-select hyperparameters. We establish a theoretical framework for probabilistically defining robustness to model change and demonstrate how our BetaRCE method directly stems from it. BetaRCE is a post-hoc method applied alongside a chosen base CFE generation method to enhance the quality of the explanation beyond robustness. It facilitates a transition from the base explanation to a more robust one with user-adjusted probability bounds. Through experimental comparisons with baselines, we show that BetaRCE yields robust, most plausible, and closest to baseline counterfactual explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Li, Guodong Long, Tianyi Zhou, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Collaborative Filtering (FedCF) is an emerging field focused on developing a new recommendation framework with preserving privacy in a federated setting. Existing FedCF methods typically combine distributed Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms with privacy-preserving mechanisms, and then preserve personalized information into a user embedding vector. However, the user embedding is usually insufficient to preserve the rich information of the fine-grained personalization across heterogeneous clients. This paper proposes a novel personalized FedCF method by preserving users' personalized information into a latent variable and a neural model simultaneously. Specifically, we decompose the modeling of user knowledge into two encoders, each designed to capture shared knowledge and personalized knowledge separately. A personalized gating network is then applied to balance personalization and generalization between the global and local encoders. Moreover, to effectively train the proposed framework, we model the CF problem as a specialized Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) task by integrating user interaction vector reconstruction with missing value prediction. The decoder is trained to reconstruct the implicit feedback from items the user has interacted with, while also predicting items the user might be interested in but has not yet interacted with. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, showcasing superior performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojian Huang, Chuanyu Qin, Zhe Liu, Kaijing Ma, Jin Chen, Han Fang, Chao Ban, Hao Sun, Zhongjiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view classification (MVC) faces inherent challenges due to domain gaps and inconsistencies across different views, often resulting in uncertainties during the fusion process. While Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) has been effective in addressing view uncertainty, existing methods predominantly rely on the Dempster-Shafer combination rule, which is sensitive to conflicting evidence and often neglects the critical role of neighborhood structures within multi-view data. To address these limitations, we propose a Trusted Unified Feature-NEighborhood Dynamics (TUNED) model for robust MVC. This method effectively integrates local and global feature-neighborhood (F-N) structures for robust decision-making. Specifically, we begin by extracting local F-N structures within each view. To further mitigate potential uncertainties and conflicts in multi-view fusion, we employ a selective Markov random field that adaptively manages cross-view neighborhood dependencies. Additionally, we employ a shared parameterized evidence extractor that learns global consensus conditioned on local F-N structures, thereby enhancing the global integration of multi-view features. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves accuracy and robustness over existing approaches, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and conflicting views.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Shen, Chuheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuchen Zheng, Xinyi Chen, Xuhang Chen, Haolun Li, Xiaojiao Guo, Weihuang Liu, Chi-Man Pun, Shoujun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation, a crucial task in computer vision, facilitates the automated delineation of anatomical structures and pathologies, supporting clinicians in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Notably, transformers employing shifted window-based self-attention have demonstrated exceptional performance. However, their reliance on local window attention limits the fusion of local and global contextual information, crucial for segmenting microtumors and miniature organs. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Semantic Segmentation Network (ASSNet), a transformer architecture that effectively integrates local and global features for precise medical image segmentation. ASSNet comprises a transformer-based U-shaped encoder-decoder network. The encoder utilizes shifted window self-attention across five resolutions to extract multi-scale features, which are then propagated to the decoder through skip connections. We introduce an augmented multi-layer perceptron within the encoder to explicitly model long-range dependencies during feature extraction. Recognizing the constraints of conventional symmetrical encoder-decoder designs, we propose an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) decoder to complement our encoder. This decoder incorporates three key components: the Long Range Dependencies (LRD) block, the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, and the Adaptive Semantic Center (ASC) block. These components synergistically facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale features extracted by the decoder while capturing long-range dependencies and refining object boundaries. Comprehensive experiments on diverse medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, demonstrate that ASSNet achieves state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become key to user experience, particularly after improved generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Grayeli, Atharva Sehgal, Omar Costilla-Reyes, Miles Cranmer, Swarat Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dasol Choi, Dongbin Na</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosive growth of deep learning applications and increasing privacy concerns, the right to be forgotten has become a critical requirement in various AI industries. For example, given a facial recognition system, some individuals may wish to remove their personal data that might have been used in the training phase. Unfortunately, deep neural networks sometimes unexpectedly leak personal identities, making this removal challenging. While recent machine unlearning algorithms aim to enable models to forget such data, we observe an unintended utility drop, termed correlation collapse, where these algorithms inadvertently weaken the essential correlations between image features and true labels during the forgetting process. To address this challenge, we propose Distribution-Level Feature Distancing (DLFD), a novel method that efficiently forgets instances while preserving task-relevant feature correlations. Our method synthesizes data samples by optimizing the feature distribution to be distinctly different from that of forget samples, achieving effective results within a single training epoch. Through extensive experiments on facial recognition datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods in both forgetting performance and model utility preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Wang, Xiuju Du, Jing Liu, Shuyi Ouyang, Yen-Wei Chen, Lanfen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) has facilitated the spatially-aware profiling of gene expressions based on histopathology images. Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text-based systems to multimodal platforms, significantly impacting various sectors including healthcare. This comprehensive review explores the progression of LLMs to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and their growing influence in medical practice. We examine the current landscape of MLLMs in healthcare, analyzing their applications across clinical decision support, medical imaging, patient engagement, and research. The review highlights the unique capabilities of MLLMs in integrating diverse data types, such as text, images, and audio, to provide more comprehensive insights into patient health. We also address the challenges facing MLLM implementation, including data limitations, technical hurdles, and ethical considerations. By identifying key research gaps, this paper aims to guide future investigations in areas such as dataset development, modality alignment methods, and the establishment of ethical guidelines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyao Qin, Arun J. Thirunavukarasu, Theodoros Arvanitis, Le Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of diabetes, characterized by thickening of the central portion of the retina due to accumulation of fluid. DME is a significant and common cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients. Center-involved DME (ci-DME) is the highest risk form of disease because fluid extends close to the fovea which is responsible for sharp central vision. Earlier diagnosis or prediction of ci-DME may improve treatment outcomes. Here, we propose an ensemble method to predict ci-DME onset within a year, after using synthetic ultra-wide field color fundus photography (UWF-CFP) images provided by the DIAMOND Challenge during development. We adopted a variety of baseline state-of-the-art classification networks including ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and VGG with the aim of enhancing model robustness. The best performing models were Densenet-121, Resnet-152 and EfficientNet-b7, and these were assembled into a definitive predictive model. The final ensemble model demonstrates a strong performance with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.7017, an F1 score of 0.6512, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.2057 when deployed on the synthetic test dataset. Results from our ensemble model were superior/comparable to previous recorded results in highly curated settings using conventional fundus photography/ultra-wide field fundus photography. Optimal sensitivity in previous studies (using humans or computers to diagnose) ranges from 67.3%-98%, specificity from 47.8%-80%. Therefore, our method can be used safely and effectively in a range of settings may facilitate earlier diagnosis, better treatment decisions, and improved prognostication in ci-DME.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanqi Du, Michael Plainer, Rob Brekelmans, Chenru Duan, Frank No\'e, Carla P. Gomes, Al\'an Aspuru-Guzik, Kirill Neklyudov</p>
<p>Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyu Chen, Han Cai, Junsong Chen, Enze Xie, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Muyang Li, Yao Lu, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingliang Liang, Martha Larson</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Word-Frequency-based Image-Text Pair Pruning (WFPP), a novel data pruning method that improves the efficiency of VLMs. Unlike MetaCLIP, our method does not need metadata for pruning, but selects text-image pairs to prune based on the content of the text. Specifically, WFPP prunes text-image pairs containing high-frequency words across the entire training dataset. The effect of WFPP is to reduce the dominance of frequent words. The result a better balanced word-frequency distribution in the dataset, which is known to improve the training of word embedding models. After pre-training on the pruned subset, we fine-tuned the model on the entire dataset for one additional epoch to achieve better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that applying WFPP when training a CLIP model improves performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. WFPP also provides the advantage of speeding up pre-training by using fewer samples. Additionally, we analyze the training data before and after pruning to visualize how WFPP changes the balance of word frequencies. We hope our work encourages researchers to consider the distribution of words in the training data when pre-training VLMs, not limited to CLIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishna Sayana, Raghavendra Vasudeva, Yuri Vasilevski, Kun Su, Liam Hebert, James Pine, Hubert Pham, Ambarish Jash, Sukhdeep Sodhi</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advances in Large Language Model's generation and reasoning capabilities present an opportunity to develop truly conversational recommendation systems. However, effectively integrating recommender system knowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards recommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by making two key contributions.
  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation tasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich user narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences, product endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase history. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research. Furthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and perform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second, the paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves as a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first attempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender signals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based CF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and personalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining CF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language metrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also provide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to this new generative task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\'as Nieto, Simon B. Eickhoff, Christian Jung, Martin Reuter, Kersten Diers, Malte Kelm, Artur Lichtenberg, Federico Raimondo, Kaustubh R. Patil</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models benefit from large datasets. Collecting data in biomedical domains is costly and challenging, hence, combining datasets has become a common practice. However, datasets obtained under different conditions could present undesired site-specific variability. Data harmonization methods aim to remove site-specific variance while retaining biologically relevant information. This study evaluates the effectiveness of popularly used ComBat-based methods for harmonizing data in scenarios where the class balance is not equal across sites. We find that these methods struggle with data leakage issues. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach PrettYharmonize, designed to harmonize data by pretending the target labels. We validate our approach using controlled datasets designed to benchmark the utility of harmonization. Finally, using real-world MRI and clinical data, we compare leakage-prone methods with PrettYharmonize and show that it achieves comparable performance while avoiding data leakage, particularly in site-target-dependence scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Nguyen-Tang, Raman Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: We study learning in a dynamically evolving environment modeled as a Markov game between a learner and a strategic opponent that can adapt to the learner's strategies. While most existing works in Markov games focus on external regret as the learning objective, external regret becomes inadequate when the adversaries are adaptive. In this work, we focus on \emph{policy regret} -- a counterfactual notion that aims to compete with the return that would have been attained if the learner had followed the best fixed sequence of policy, in hindsight. We show that if the opponent has unbounded memory or if it is non-stationary, then sample-efficient learning is not possible. For memory-bounded and stationary, we show that learning is still statistically hard if the set of feasible strategies for the learner is exponentially large. To guarantee learnability, we introduce a new notion of \emph{consistent} adaptive adversaries, wherein, the adversary responds similarly to similar strategies of the learner. We provide algorithms that achieve $\sqrt{T}$ policy regret against memory-bounded, stationary, and consistent adversaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Pelletreau-Duris, Ruud van Bakel, Michael Cochez</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on many tasks, but this often requires increasingly larger model sizes, which in turn leads to more complex internal representations. Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-relational nature of Graph neural networks (GNNs) make it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for well-known structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for GNNs employing diagnostic classifiers. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shravan Venkatraman, Jaskaran Singh Walia, Joe Dhanith P R</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is a computer vision task where a model analyzes an image to categorize it into a specific label. Vision Transformers (ViT) improve this task by leveraging self-attention to capture complex patterns and long range relationships between image patches. However, a key challenge for ViTs is efficiently incorporating multiscale feature representations, which is inherent in CNNs through their hierarchical structure. In this paper, we introduce the Scale-Aware Graph Attention Vision Transformer (SAG-ViT), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by integrating multi-scale features. Using EfficientNet as a backbone, the model extracts multi-scale feature maps, which are divided into patches to preserve semantic information. These patches are organized into a graph based on spatial and feature similarities, with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) refining the node embeddings. Finally, a Transformer encoder captures long-range dependencies and complex interactions. The SAG-ViT is evaluated on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing image classification performance.

<p>Abstract: Direct preference learning offers a promising and computation-efficient beyond supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for improving code generation in coding large language models (LMs). However, the scarcity of reliable preference data is a bottleneck for the performance of direct preference learning to improve the coding accuracy of code LMs. In this paper, we introduce \underline{\textbf{D}}irect Preference Learning with Only \underline{\textbf{S}}elf-Generated \underline{\textbf{T}}ests and \underline{\textbf{C}}ode (DSTC), a framework that leverages only self-generated code snippets and tests to construct reliable preference pairs such that direct preference learning can improve LM coding accuracy without external annotations. DSTC combines a minimax selection process and test-code concatenation to improve preference pair quality, reducing the influence of incorrect self-generated tests and enhancing model performance without the need for costly reward models. When applied with direct preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), DSTC yields stable improvements in coding accuracy (pass@1 score) across diverse coding benchmarks, including HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench, demonstrating both its effectiveness and scalability for models of various sizes. This approach autonomously enhances code generation accuracy across LLMs of varying sizes, reducing reliance on expensive annotated coding datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the substantial rise in online retail and e-commerce in recent years, the demand for efficient and fast solutions to Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) has become critical. To manage the increasing demand, companies have adopted the strategy of adding more depots. However, the presence of multiple depots introduces additional complexities, making existing VRP solutions suboptimal for addressing the Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). Traditional methods for solving the MDVRP often require significant computation time, making them unsuitable for large-scale instances. Additionally, existing learning-based solutions for the MDVRP struggle with generalizability and fail to deliver high-quality results for scenarios involving a large number of customers. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for MDVRP. Our approach employs an attention mechanism, featuring a decoder with two key layers: one layer to consider the states of all vehicles and learn to select the most suitable vehicle based on the proximity of unassigned customers, and another layer to focus on assigning a customer to the selected vehicle. This approach delivers high-quality solutions for large-scale MDVRP instances and demonstrates remarkable generalizability across varying numbers of customers and depots. Its adaptability and performance make it a practical and deployable solution for real-world logistics challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Keywords: Image super-resolution, Computer vision, Attention mechanism, Transformer</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation with Large Language Models is a promising paradigm for augmenting natural data over a nearly infinite range of tasks. Given this variety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are scarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what bottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of synthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity, and complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in open-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream models. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model generalization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution generalization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize the existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the downstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various components in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This examination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation algorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on data QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance of balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and self-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data, often there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity which impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are currently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting output diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that balancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future self-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Lin, Jiaqi Gu, Lubin Fan, Bojian Wu, Yujing Lou, Renjie Chen, Ligang Liu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality novel view renderings of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in scenes featuring transient objects is challenging. We propose a novel hybrid representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes. Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in both indoor and outdoor scenes, even in the presence of distracting elements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Han, Zhen Jia, Boyi Li, Yan Wang, Boris Ivanovic, Yurong You, Lingjie Liu, Yue Wang, Marco Pavone, Chen Feng, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting methods across different difficulty levels. Our results show that Gaussian Splatting is prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training. We have released our data to help advance self-driving and urban robotics simulation technology.</p>

<p>Abstract: The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and Large Language Models (LLMs) for web interaction tasks. Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. BrowserGym aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and action spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. Combined with AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis, BrowserGym offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. This standardized approach seeks to reduce the time and complexity of developing web agents, supporting more reliable comparisons and facilitating in-depth analysis of agent behaviors, and could result in more adaptable, capable agents, ultimately accelerating innovation in LLM-driven automation. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across all benchmarks currently available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atit Pokharel, Shashank Dahal, Pratik Sapkota, Bhupendra Bimal Chhetri</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have opened new prospects in medical sciences for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of severe health conditions. This paper focuses on the development of an ML model with high predictive accuracy to classify arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The ECG signals datasets utilized in this study were sourced from the PhysioNet and MIT-BIH databases. The research commenced with binary classification, where an optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model yielded excellent results in differentiating normal and atrial fibrillation signals. A pivotal aspect of this research was a survey among medical professionals, which not only validated the practicality of AI-based ECG classifiers but also identified areas for improvement, including accuracy and the inclusion of more arrhythmia types. These insights drove the development of an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system capable of classifying five different types of ECG signals with better accuracy and precision. The CNN model's robust performance was ensured through rigorous stratified 5-fold cross validation. A web portal was also developed to demonstrate real-world utility, offering access to the trained model for real-time classification. This study highlights the potential applications of such models in remote health monitoring, predictive healthcare, assistive diagnostic tools, and simulated environments for educational training and interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists and medical personnel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinchan Li, Kenneth Chen, Changyue Su, Qi Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown unprecedented success in the task of text-to-image generation. While these models are capable of generating high-quality and realistic images, the complexity of sequential denoising has raised societal concerns regarding high computational demands and energy consumption. In response, various efforts have been made to improve inference efficiency. However, most of the existing efforts have taken a fixed approach with neural network simplification or text prompt optimization. Are the quality improvements from all denoising computations equally perceivable to humans? We observed that images from different text prompts may require different computational efforts given the desired content. The observation motivates us to present BudgetFusion, a novel model that suggests the most perceptually efficient number of diffusion steps before a diffusion model starts to generate an image. This is achieved by predicting multi-level perceptual metrics relative to diffusion steps. With the popular Stable Diffusion as an example, we conduct both numerical analyses and user studies. Our experiments show that BudgetFusion saves up to five seconds per prompt without compromising perceptual similarity. We hope this work can initiate efforts toward answering a core question: how much do humans perceptually gain from images created by a generative model, per watt of energy?</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05821">An Entailment Tree Generation Approach for Multimodal Multi-Hop Question Answering with Mixture-of-Experts and Iterative Feedback Mechanism</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Zhang, Haocheng Lv, Jie Liu, Zhiyun Chen, Jianyong Duan, Hao Wang, Li He, Mingying Xv</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of large-scale language models (LLMs), it is currently popular and effective to convert multimodal information into text descriptions for multimodal multi-hop question answering. However, we argue that the current methods of multi-modal multi-hop question answering still mainly face two challenges: 1) The retrieved evidence containing a large amount of redundant information, inevitably leads to a significant drop in performance due to irrelevant information misleading the prediction. 2) The reasoning process without interpretable reasoning steps makes the model difficult to discover the logical errors for handling complex questions. To solve these problems, we propose a unified LLMs-based approach but without heavily relying on them due to the LLM's potential errors, and innovatively treat multimodal multi-hop question answering as a joint entailment tree generation and question answering problem. Specifically, we design a multi-task learning framework with a focus on facilitating common knowledge sharing across interpretability and prediction tasks while preventing task-specific errors from interfering with each other via mixture of experts. Afterward, we design an iterative feedback mechanism to further enhance both tasks by feeding back the results of the joint training to the LLM for regenerating entailment trees, aiming to iteratively refine the potential answer. Notably, our method has won the first place in the official leaderboard of WebQA (since April 10, 2024), and achieves competitive results on MultimodalQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonho Jeong, Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Jong Chul Ye, Niloy Mitra, Duygu Ceylan</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent foundational video generators produce visually rich output, they still struggle with appearance drift, where objects gradually degrade or change inconsistently across frames, breaking visual coherence. We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06289">S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by Structured Sparsity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yang, Jixuan Leng, Geyang Guo, Jiawei Zhao, Ryumei Nakada, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao, Beidi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously. To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06510">AnomalyControl: Learning Cross-modal Semantic Features for Controllable Anomaly Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shidan He, Lei Liu, Shen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for advancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning became an ubiquitous paradigm due to its extraordinary effectiveness and applicability in numerous domains. However, the approach suffers from the high demand of data required to achieve the potential of this type of model. An ever-increasing sub-field of Artificial Intelligence, Image Synthesis, aims to address this limitation through the design of intelligent models capable of creating original and realistic images, endeavour which could drastically reduce the need for real data. The Stable Diffusion generation paradigm recently propelled state-of-the-art approaches to exceed all previous benchmarks. In this work, we propose the ContRail framework based on the novel Stable Diffusion model ControlNet, which we empower through a multi-modal conditioning method. We experiment with the task of synthetic railway image generation, where we improve the performance in rail-specific tasks, such as rail semantic segmentation by enriching the dataset with realistic synthetic images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuqing Li, Chenran Zhang, Cuiyun Gao, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Extended Reality (XR, encompassing AR, MR, and VR) and spatial computing technologies forms a foundational layer for the emerging Metaverse, enabling innovative applications across healthcare, education, manufacturing, and entertainment. However, research in this area is often limited by the lack of large, representative, and highquality application datasets that can support empirical studies and the development of new approaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZoo, a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge this gap. XRZoo contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores, across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailed metadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, application categories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications, etc. By making XRZoo publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XR software engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinary investigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems by providing examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability, usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZoo will be released and actively maintained.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06787">[MASK] is All You Need</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\"orn Ommer</p>
<p>Abstract: In generative models, two paradigms have gained attraction in various applications: next-set prediction-based Masked Generative Models and next-noise prediction-based Non-Autoregressive Models, e.g., Diffusion Models. In this work, we propose using discrete-state models to connect them and explore their scalability in the vision domain. First, we conduct a step-by-step analysis in a unified design space across two types of models including timestep-independence, noise schedule, temperature, guidance strength, etc in a scalable manner. Second, we re-cast typical discriminative tasks, e.g., image segmentation, as an unmasking process from [MASK] tokens on a discrete-state model. This enables us to perform various sampling processes, including flexible conditional sampling by only training once to model the joint distribution. All aforementioned explorations lead to our framework named Discrete Interpolants, which enables us to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to previous discrete-state based methods in various benchmarks, like ImageNet256, MS COCO, and video dataset FaceForensics. In summary, by leveraging [MASK] in discrete-state models, we can bridge Masked Generative and Non-autoregressive Diffusion models, as well as generative and discriminative tasks.</p>
