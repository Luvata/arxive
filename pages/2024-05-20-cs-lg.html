<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang, Xiao Wang, Yutong Wang, Jiawei Wang, Fei-Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) can effectively model the ever-evolving nature of real-world knowledge, and their completeness and enhancement can be achieved by reasoning new events from existing ones. However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muqsit Azeem, Marta Grobelna, Sudeep Kanav, Jan Kretinsky, Stefanie Mohr, Sabine Rieder</p>
<p>Abstract: The behavior of neural networks (NNs) on previously unseen types of data (out-of-distribution or OOD) is typically unpredictable. This can be dangerous if the network's output is used for decision-making in a safety-critical system. Hence, detecting that an input is OOD is crucial for the safe application of the NN. Verification approaches do not scale to practical NNs, making runtime monitoring more appealing for practical use. While various monitors have been suggested recently, their optimization for a given problem, as well as comparison with each other and reproduction of results, remain challenging. We present a tool for users and developers of NN monitors. It allows for (i) application of various types of monitors from the literature to a given input NN, (ii) optimization of the monitor's hyperparameters, and (iii) experimental evaluation and comparison to other approaches. Besides, it facilitates the development of new monitoring approaches. We demonstrate the tool's usability on several use cases of different types of users as well as on a case study comparing different approaches from recent literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George K. Fordjour, Alfred J. Kalyanapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ashland City, Tennessee, located within the Lower Cumberland Sycamore watershed, is highly susceptible to flooding due to increased upstream water levels. This study aimed to develop a robust flood prediction model for the city, utilizing water level data at 30-minute intervals from ten USGS gauge stations within the watershed. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, known for its ability to effectively process sequential time-series data, was used. The model was trained, validated, and tested using a year-long dataset (January 2021-January 2022), and its performance was evaluated using statistical metrics including Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Percent Bias (PBIAS), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2). The results demonstrated a high level of accuracy, with the model explaining 98.2% of the variance in the data. Despite minor discrepancies between predicted and observed values, the GRU model proved to be an effective tool for flood prediction in Ashland City, with potential applications for enhancing disaster preparedness and response efforts in Ashland City.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazanin Mohammadi Sepahvand, Vincent Dumoulin, Eleni Triantafillou, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning models are becoming larger and data-hungrier, there are growing ethical, legal and technical concerns over use of data: in practice, agreements on data use may change over time, rendering previously-used training data impermissible for training purposes. These issues have driven increased attention to machine unlearning: removing "the influence of" a subset of training data from a trained model. In this work, we advocate for a relaxed definition of unlearning that does not address privacy applications but targets a scenario where a data owner withdraws permission of use of their data for training purposes. In this context, we consider the important problem of \emph{transfer unlearning} where a pretrained model is transferred to a target dataset that contains some "non-static" data that may need to be unlearned in the future. We propose a new method that uses a mechanism for selecting relevant examples from an auxiliary "static" dataset, and finetunes on the selected data instead of "non-static" target data; addressing all unlearning requests ahead of time. We also adapt a recent relaxed definition of unlearning to our problem setting and demonstrate that our approach is an exact transfer unlearner according to it, while being highly efficient (amortized). We find that our method outperforms the gold standard "exact unlearning" (finetuning on only the "static" portion of the target dataset) on several datasets, especially for small "static" sets, sometimes approaching an upper bound for test accuracy. We also analyze factors influencing the accuracy boost obtained by data selection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10426">Memory-efficient Energy-adaptive Inference of Pre-Trained Models on Batteryless Embedded Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pietro Farina, Subrata Biswas, Eren Y{\i}ld{\i}z, Khakim Akhunov, Saad Ahmed, Bashima Islam, Kas{\i}m Sinan Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m</p>
<p>Abstract: Batteryless systems frequently face power failures, requiring extra runtime buffers to maintain inference progress and leaving only a memory space for storing ultra-tiny deep neural networks (DNNs). Besides, making these models responsive to stochastic energy harvesting dynamics during inference requires a balance between inference accuracy, latency, and energy overhead. Recent works on compression mostly focus on time and memory, but often ignore energy dynamics or significantly reduce the accuracy of pre-trained DNNs. Existing energy-adaptive inference works modify the architecture of pre-trained models and have significant memory overhead. Thus, energy-adaptive and accurate inference of pre-trained DNNs on batteryless devices with extreme memory constraints is more challenging than traditional microcontrollers. We combat these issues by proposing FreeML, a framework to optimize pre-trained DNN models for memory-efficient and energy-adaptive inference on batteryless systems. FreeML comprises (1) a novel compression technique to reduce the model footprint and runtime memory requirements simultaneously, making them executable on extremely memory-constrained batteryless platforms; and (2) the first early exit mechanism that uses a single exit branch for all exit points to terminate inference at any time, making models energy-adaptive with minimal memory overhead. Our experiments showed that FreeML reduces the model sizes by up to $95 \times$, supports adaptive inference with a $2.03-19.65 \times$ less memory overhead, and provides significant time and energy benefits with only a negligible accuracy drop compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Lan, Zhenghao Liu, Yu Gu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xiaohua Li, Liner Yang, Ge Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fact verification tasks aim to identify the integrity of textual contents according to the truthful corpus. Existing fact verification models usually build a fully connected reasoning graph, which regards claim-evidence pairs as nodes and connects them with edges. They employ the graph to propagate the semantics of the nodes. Nevertheless, the noisy nodes usually propagate their semantics via the edges of the reasoning graph, which misleads the semantic representations of other nodes and amplifies the noise signals. To mitigate the propagation of noisy semantic information, we introduce a Confidential Graph Attention Network (CO-GAT), which proposes a node masking mechanism for modeling the nodes. Specifically, CO-GAT calculates the node confidence score by estimating the relevance between the claim and evidence pieces. Then, the node masking mechanism uses the node confidence scores to control the noise information flow from the vanilla node to the other graph nodes. CO-GAT achieves a 73.59% FEVER score on the FEVER dataset and shows the generalization ability by broadening the effectiveness to the science-specific domain.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10513">Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zhang, Xuanyu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) requires edge devices to perform local training and exchange information with a parameter server, leading to substantial energy consumption. A critical challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid energy depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which curtails their operational lifespan and affects the learning performance. To address this issue, we apply energy harvesting technique in FL systems to extract ambient energy for continuously powering edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is impacted by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10515">Improved AdaBoost for Virtual Reality Experience Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Memory Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Fan, Zhicheng Ding, Ruixin Huang, Chang Zhou, Xuyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: A classification prediction algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) improved AdaBoost is used to predict virtual reality (VR) user experience. The dataset is randomly divided into training and test sets in the ratio of 7:3.During the training process, the model's loss value decreases from 0.65 to 0.31, which shows that the model gradually reduces the discrepancy between the prediction results and the actual labels, and improves the accuracy and generalisation ability.The final loss value of 0.31 indicates that the model fits the training data well, and is able to make predictions and classifications more accurately. The confusion matrix for the training set shows a total of 177 correct predictions and 52 incorrect predictions, with an accuracy of 77%, precision of 88%, recall of 77% and f1 score of 82%. The confusion matrix for the test set shows a total of 167 correct and 53 incorrect predictions with 75% accuracy, 87% precision, 57% recall and 69% f1 score. In summary, the classification prediction algorithm based on LSTM with improved AdaBoost shows good prediction ability for virtual reality user experience. This study is of great significance to enhance the application of virtual reality technology in user experience. By combining LSTM and AdaBoost algorithms, significant progress has been made in user experience prediction, which not only improves the accuracy and generalisation ability of the model, but also provides useful insights for related research in the field of virtual reality. This approach can help developers better understand user requirements, optimise virtual reality product design, and enhance user satisfaction, promoting the wide application of virtual reality technology in various fields.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10531">Nonparametric Teaching of Implicit Neural Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Zhang, Steven Tin Sui Luo, Jason Chun Lok Li, Yik-Chung Wu, Ngai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the learning of implicit neural representation (INR) using an overparameterized multilayer perceptron (MLP) via a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. The latter offers an efficient example selection framework for teaching nonparametrically defined (viz. non-closed-form) target functions, such as image functions defined by 2D grids of pixels. To address the costly training of INRs, we propose a paradigm called Implicit Neural Teaching (INT) that treats INR learning as a nonparametric teaching problem, where the given signal being fitted serves as the target function. The teacher then selects signal fragments for iterative training of the MLP to achieve fast convergence. By establishing a connection between MLP evolution through parameter-based gradient descent and that of function evolution through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching an overparameterized MLP is consistent with teaching a nonparametric learner. This new discovery readily permits a convenient drop-in of nonparametric teaching algorithms to broadly enhance INR training efficiency, demonstrating 30%+ training time savings across various input modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Hay, Nir Sharon</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurately estimating a function on one domain when only its discrete samples are available on another domain. To answer this challenge, we utilize a neural network, which we train to incorporate prior knowledge of the function. In addition, by carefully analyzing the problem, we obtain a bound on the error over the extrapolation domain and define a condition number for this problem that quantifies the level of difficulty of the setup. Compared to other machine learning methods that provide time series prediction, such as transformers, our approach is suitable for setups where the interpolation and extrapolation regions are general subdomains and, in particular, manifolds. In addition, our construction leads to an improved loss function that helps us boost the accuracy and robustness of our neural network. We conduct comprehensive numerical tests and comparisons of our extrapolation versus standard methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Lange-Hegermann, Christoph Zimmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Experimental exploration of high-cost systems with safety constraints, common in engineering applications, is a challenging endeavor. Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stock price prediction has always been a difficult task for forecasters. Using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, stock price prediction based on investor sentiment extracted from online forums has become feasible. We propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework for predicting stock prices. The framework leverages the XLNET model to analyze the sentiment conveyed in user posts on online forums, combines these sentiments with the post popularity factor to compute daily group sentiments, and integrates this information with stock technical indicators into an improved BiLSTM-highway model for stock price prediction. Through a series of comparative experiments involving four stocks on the Chinese stock market, it is demonstrated that the hybrid framework effectively predicts stock prices. This study reveals the necessity of analyzing investors' textual views for stock price prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Li, Jingshu Peng, Haoyang Li, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series analysis plays a pivotal role across a range of critical applications, from finance to healthcare, which involves various tasks, such as forecasting and classification. To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods for time series have already reached excellent performances in both prediction and classification tasks, including anomaly detection. However, the complexity inherent in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) creates a challenge when it comes to explainability methods. To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with a simple CPS-based dataset show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guner Dilsad Er, Sebastian Trimpe, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a distributed learning problem, where agents minimize a global objective function by exchanging information over a network. Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary, and (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents. We can therefore guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct. We analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm and derive accelerated convergence rates in a convex setting. We also characterize the effect of communication drops and demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to communication failures. The article concludes by presenting numerical results from a distributed LASSO problem, and distributed learning tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments underline communication savings of 50% or more due to the event-based communication strategy, show resilience towards heterogeneous data-distributions, and highlight that our approach outperforms common baselines such as FedAvg, FedProx, and FedADMM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinchuan Zhang, Bei Hui, Chong Mu, Ming Sun, Ling Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of (1) investigating the influences of multi-granularity interactions across recent snapshots and (2) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, especially events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring ($\mathsf{HisRES}$). Concretely, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of $\mathsf{HisRES}$ and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in graph representation learning. Message passing neural networks, which learn representations through recursively aggregating information from each node and its neighbors, are among the most commonly-used GNNs. However, a wealth of structural information of individual nodes and full graphs is often ignored in such process, which restricts the expressive power of GNNs. Various graph data augmentation methods that enable the message passing with richer structure knowledge have been introduced as one main way to tackle this issue, but they are often focused on individual structure features and difficult to scale up with more structure features. In this work we propose a novel approach, namely collective structure knowledge-augmented graph neural network (CoS-GNN), in which a new message passing method is introduced to allow GNNs to harness a diverse set of node- and graph-level structure features, together with original node features/attributes, in augmented graphs. In doing so, our approach largely improves the structural knowledge modeling of GNNs in both node and graph levels, resulting in substantially improved graph representations. This is justified by extensive empirical results where CoS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in various graph-level learning tasks, including graph classification, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Liu, Zelin Yao, Yibing Zhan, Xueqi Ma, Dapeng Tao, Jia Wu, Wenbin Hu, Shirui Pan, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Masked Autoencoders (GMAEs) have emerged as a notable self-supervised learning approach for graph-structured data. Existing GMAE models primarily focus on reconstructing node-level information, categorizing them as single-scale GMAEs. This methodology, while effective in certain contexts, tends to overlook the complex hierarchical structures inherent in many real-world graphs. For instance, molecular graphs exhibit a clear hierarchical organization in the form of the atoms-functional groups-molecules structure. Hence, the inability of single-scale GMAE models to incorporate these hierarchical relationships often leads to their inadequate capture of crucial high-level graph information, resulting in a noticeable decline in performance. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Graph Masked AutoEncoders (Hi-GMAE), a novel multi-scale GMAE framework designed to handle the hierarchical structures within graphs. First, Hi-GMAE constructs a multi-scale graph hierarchy through graph pooling, enabling the exploration of graph structures across different granularity levels. To ensure masking uniformity of subgraphs across these scales, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that initiates masking at the coarsest scale and progressively back-projects the mask to the finer scales. Furthermore, we integrate a gradual recovery strategy with the masking process to mitigate the learning challenges posed by completely masked subgraphs. Diverging from the standard graph neural network (GNN) used in GMAE models, Hi-GMAE modifies its encoder and decoder into hierarchical structures. This entails using GNN at the finer scales for detailed local graph analysis and employing a graph transformer at coarser scales to capture global information. Our experiments on 15 graph datasets consistently demonstrate that Hi-GMAE outperforms 17 state-of-the-art self-supervised competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyue Song, Jiacheng Wang, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention for addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns. While parallel FL algorithms like FedAvg exhibit remarkable performance, they face challenges in scenarios with diverse network speeds and concerns about centralized control, especially in multi-institutional collaborations like the medical domain. Serial FL presents an alternative solution, circumventing these challenges by transferring model updates serially between devices in a cyclical manner. Nevertheless, it is deemed inferior to parallel FL in that (1) its performance shows undesirable fluctuations, and (2) it converges to a lower plateau, particularly when dealing with non-IID data. The observed phenomenon is attributed to catastrophic forgetting due to knowledge loss from previous sites. In this paper, to overcome fluctuation and low efficiency in the iterative learning and forgetting process, we introduce cyclical weight consolidation (CWC), a straightforward yet potent approach specifically tailored for serial FL. CWC employs a consolidation matrix to regulate local optimization. This matrix tracks the significance of each parameter on the overall federation throughout the entire training trajectory, preventing abrupt changes in significant weights. During revisitation, to maintain adaptability, old memory undergoes decay to incorporate new information. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that in various non-IID settings, CWC mitigates the fluctuation behavior of the original serial FL approach and enhances the converged performance consistently and significantly. The improved performance is either comparable to or better than the parallel vanilla.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Hasan Ahmadilivani, Seyedhamidreza Mousavi, Jaan Raik, Masoud Daneshtalab, Maksim Jenihhin</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become integral in safety-critical applications, thus raising concerns about their fault tolerance. Conventional hardware-dependent fault tolerance methods, such as Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are computationally expensive, imposing a remarkable overhead on CNNs. Whereas fault tolerance techniques can be applied either at the hardware level or at the model levels, the latter provides more flexibility without sacrificing generality. This paper introduces a model-level hardening approach for CNNs by integrating error correction directly into the neural networks. The approach is hardware-agnostic and does not require any changes to the underlying accelerator device. Analyzing the vulnerability of parameters enables the duplication of selective filters/neurons so that their output channels are effectively corrected with an efficient and robust correction layer. The proposed method demonstrates fault resilience nearly equivalent to TMR-based correction but with significantly reduced overhead. Nevertheless, there exists an inherent overhead to the baseline CNNs. To tackle this issue, a cost-effective parameter vulnerability based pruning technique is proposed that outperforms the conventional pruning method, yielding smaller networks with a negligible accuracy loss. Remarkably, the hardened pruned CNNs perform up to 24\% faster than the hardened un-pruned ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Tschiatschek, Eugenia Stamboliev, Timoth ee Schmude, Mark Coeckelbergh, Laura Koesten</p>
<p>Abstract: We discuss the role of humans in algorithmic decision-making (ADM) for socially relevant problems from a technical and philosophical perspective. In particular, we illustrate tensions arising from diverse expectations, values, and constraints by and on the humans involved. To this end, we assume that a strategic decision-maker (SDM) introduces ADM to optimize strategic and societal goals while the algorithms' recommended actions are overseen by a practical decision-maker (PDM) - a specific human-in-the-loop - who makes the final decisions. While the PDM is typically assumed to be a corrective, it can counteract the realization of the SDM's desired goals and societal values not least because of a misalignment of these values and unmet information needs of the PDM. This has significant implications for the distribution of power between the stakeholders in ADM, their constraints, and information needs. In particular, we emphasize the overseeing PDM's role as a potential political and ethical decision maker, who acts expected to balance strategic, value-driven objectives and on-the-ground individual decisions and constraints. We demonstrate empirically, on a machine learning benchmark dataset, the significant impact an overseeing PDM's decisions can have even if the PDM is constrained to performing only a limited amount of actions differing from the algorithms' recommendations. To ensure that the SDM's intended values are realized, the PDM needs to be provided with appropriate information conveyed through tailored explanations and its role must be characterized clearly. Our findings emphasize the need for an in-depth discussion of the role and power of the PDM and challenge the often-taken view that just including a human-in-the-loop in ADM ensures the 'correct' and 'ethical' functioning of the system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Sawczyn, Jakub Binkowski, Piotr Bielak, Tomasz Kajdanowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge-intensive tasks pose a significant challenge for Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Commonly adopted methods, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often exhibit limitations when applied to such tasks. Nevertheless, there have been notable endeavours to mitigate these challenges, with a significant emphasis on augmenting LLMs through Knowledge Graphs (KGs). While KGs provide many advantages for representing knowledge, their development costs can deter extensive research and applications. Addressing this limitation, we introduce a framework for enriching embeddings of small-scale domain-specific Knowledge Graphs with well-established general-purpose KGs. Adopting our method, a modest domain-specific KG can benefit from a performance boost in downstream tasks when linked to a substantial general-purpose KG. Experimental evaluations demonstrate a notable enhancement, with up to a 44% increase observed in the Hits@10 metric. This relatively unexplored research direction can catalyze more frequent incorporation of KGs in knowledge-intensive tasks, resulting in more robust, reliable ML implementations, which hallucinates less than prevalent LLM solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Zhang, Minhua Lin, Enyan Dai, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. However, recent works reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Generally, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching backdoor triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. A GNN trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes attached with trigger to the target class. Despite their effectiveness, our empirical analysis shows that triggers generated by existing methods tend to be out-of-distribution (OOD), which significantly differ from the clean data. Hence, these injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned with widely used outlier detection methods in real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with in-distribution (ID) triggers. To generate ID triggers, we introduce an OOD detector in conjunction with an adversarial learning strategy to generate the attributes of the triggers within distribution. To ensure a high attack success rate with ID triggers, we introduce novel modules designed to enhance trigger memorization by the victim model trained on poisoned graph. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating in distribution triggers that can by-pass various defense strategies while maintaining a high attack success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Dong, Renhe Jiang, Haotian Gao, Hangchen Liu, Jinliang Deng, Qingsong Wen, Xuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal time series forecasting plays a key role in a wide range of real-world applications. While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability.

<p>Abstract: Generative modeling aims at producing new datapoints whose statistical properties resemble the ones in a training dataset. In recent years, there has been a burst of machine learning techniques and settings that can achieve this goal with remarkable performances. In most of these settings, one uses the training dataset in conjunction with noise, which is added as a source of statistical variability and is essential for the generative task. Here, we explore the idea of using internal chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional chaotic systems as a way to generate new datapoints from a training dataset. We show that simple learning rules can achieve this goal within a set of vanilla architectures and characterize the quality of the generated datapoints through standard accuracy measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Fumagalli, Maximilian Muschalik, Patrick Kolpaczki, Eyke H\"ullermeier, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: The Shapley value (SV) is a prevalent approach of allocating credit to machine learning (ML) entities to understand black box ML models. Enriching such interpretations with higher-order interactions is inevitable for complex systems, where the Shapley Interaction Index (SII) is a direct axiomatic extension of the SV. While it is well-known that the SV yields an optimal approximation of any game via a weighted least square (WLS) objective, an extension of this result to SII has been a long-standing open problem, which even led to the proposal of an alternative index. In this work, we characterize higher-order SII as a solution to a WLS problem, which constructs an optimal approximation via SII and $k$-Shapley values ($k$-SII). We prove this representation for the SV and pairwise SII and give empirically validated conjectures for higher orders. As a result, we propose KernelSHAP-IQ, a direct extension of KernelSHAP for SII, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for feature interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Sani, Alex Iacob, Zeyu Cao, Bill Marino, Yan Gao, Tomas Paulik, Wanru Zhao, William F. Shen, Preslav Aleksandrov, Xinchi Qiu, Nicholas D. Lane</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance over a wide range of tasks, thanks to the unprecedented amount of data they have been trained on. As established scaling laws indicate, LLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing and data sources we can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computational resources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused training methodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible, reproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration across institutions to train LLMs. This would mobilize more computational and data resources while matching or potentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show the effectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present our approach for training a billion-scale federated LLM using limited resources. This will help data-rich actors to become the protagonists of LLMs pre-training instead of leaving the stage to compute-rich actors alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyou Guo, Yan Sun, Tieru Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series (TS) forecasting has been an unprecedentedly popular problem in recent years, with ubiquitous applications in both scientific and business fields. Various approaches have been introduced to time series analysis, including both statistical approaches and deep neural networks. Although neural network approaches have illustrated stronger ability of representation than statistical methods, they struggle to provide sufficient interpretablility, and can be too complicated to optimize. In this paper, we present WEITS, a frequency-aware deep learning framework that is highly interpretable and computationally efficient. Through multi-level wavelet decomposition, WEITS novelly infuses frequency analysis into a highly deep learning framework. Combined with a forward-backward residual architecture, it enjoys both high representation capability and statistical interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated competitive performance of our model, along with its additional advantage of high computation efficiency. Furthermore, WEITS provides a general framework that can always seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art approaches for time series forecast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Shapira, Naor Wiesel, Shahar Shabelman, Dana Drachsler-Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Proving local robustness is crucial to increase the reliability of neural networks. While many verifiers prove robustness in $L_\infty$ $\epsilon$-balls, very little work deals with robustness verification in $L_0$ $\epsilon$-balls, capturing robustness to few pixel attacks. This verification introduces a combinatorial challenge, because the space of pixels to perturb is discrete and of exponential size. A previous work relies on covering designs to identify sets for defining $L_\infty$ neighborhoods, which if proven robust imply that the $L_0$ $\epsilon$-ball is robust. However, the number of neighborhoods to verify remains very high, leading to a high analysis time. We propose covering verification designs, a combinatorial design that tailors effective but analysis-incompatible coverings to $L_0$ robustness verification. The challenge is that computing a covering verification design introduces a high time and memory overhead, which is intensified in our setting, where multiple candidate coverings are required to identify how to reduce the overall analysis time. We introduce CoVerD, an $L_0$ robustness verifier that selects between different candidate coverings without constructing them, but by predicting their block size distribution. This prediction relies on a theorem providing closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of this distribution. CoVerD constructs the chosen covering verification design on-the-fly, while keeping the memory consumption minimal and enabling to parallelize the analysis. The experimental results show that CoVerD reduces the verification time on average by up to 5.1x compared to prior work and that it scales to larger $L_0$ $\epsilon$-balls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucius Bushnaq, Jake Mendel, Stefan Heimersheim, Dan Braun, Nicholas Goldowsky-Dill, Kaarel H\"anni, Cindy Wu, Marius Hobbhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability aims to reverse engineer the algorithms implemented by neural networks by studying their weights and activations. An obstacle to reverse engineering neural networks is that many of the parameters inside a network are not involved in the computation being implemented by the network. These degenerate parameters may obfuscate internal structure. Singular learning theory teaches us that neural network parameterizations are biased towards being more degenerate, and parameterizations with more degeneracy are likely to generalize further. We identify 3 ways that network parameters can be degenerate: linear dependence between activations in a layer; linear dependence between gradients passed back to a layer; ReLUs which fire on the same subset of datapoints. We also present a heuristic argument that modular networks are likely to be more degenerate, and we develop a metric for identifying modules in a network that is based on this argument. We propose that if we can represent a neural network in a way that is invariant to reparameterizations that exploit the degeneracies, then this representation is likely to be more interpretable, and we provide some evidence that such a representation is likely to have sparser interactions. We introduce the Interaction Basis, a tractable technique to obtain a representation that is invariant to degeneracies from linear dependence of activations or Jacobians.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the behavior of neural networks by reverse-engineering their internal computations. However, current methods struggle to find clear interpretations of neural network activations because a decomposition of activations into computational features is missing. Individual neurons or model components do not cleanly correspond to distinct features or functions. We present a novel interpretability method that aims to overcome this limitation by transforming the activations of the network into a new basis - the Local Interaction Basis (LIB). LIB aims to identify computational features by removing irrelevant activations and interactions. Our method drops irrelevant activation directions and aligns the basis with the singular vectors of the Jacobian matrix between adjacent layers. It also scales features based on their importance for downstream computation, producing an interaction graph that shows all computationally-relevant features and interactions in a model. We evaluate the effectiveness of LIB on modular addition and CIFAR-10 models, finding that it identifies more computationally-relevant features that interact more sparsely, compared to principal component analysis. However, LIB does not yield substantial improvements in interpretability or interaction sparsity when applied to language models. We conclude that LIB is a promising theory-driven approach for analyzing neural networks, but in its current form is not applicable to large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangjun Ruan, Chris J. Maddison, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~80 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hariprasath Govindarajan, Per Sid\'en, Jacob Roll, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-distillation methods using Siamese networks are popular for self-supervised pre-training. DINO is one such method based on a cross-entropy loss between $K$-dimensional probability vectors, obtained by applying a softmax function to the dot product between representations and learnt prototypes. Given the fact that the learned representations are $L^2$-normalized, we show that DINO and its derivatives, such as iBOT, can be interpreted as a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher components. With this interpretation, DINO assumes equal precision for all components when the prototypes are also $L^2$-normalized. Using this insight we propose DINO-vMF, that adds appropriate normalization constants when computing the cluster assignment probabilities. Unlike DINO, DINO-vMF is stable also for the larger ViT-Base model with unnormalized prototypes. We show that the added flexibility of the mixture model is beneficial in terms of better image representations. The DINO-vMF pre-trained model consistently performs better than DINO on a range of downstream tasks. We obtain similar improvements for iBOT-vMF vs iBOT and thereby show the relevance of our proposed modification also for other methods derived from DINO.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in experimental methods have enabled researchers to collect data on thousands of analytes simultaneously. This has led to correlational studies that associated molecular measurements with diseases such as Alzheimer's, Liver, and Gastric Cancer. However, the use of thousands of biomarkers selected from the analytes is not practical for real-world medical diagnosis and is likely undesirable due to potentially formed spurious correlations. In this study, we evaluate 4 different methods for biomarker selection and 4 different machine learning (ML) classifiers for identifying correlations, evaluating 16 approaches in all. We found that contemporary methods outperform previously reported logistic regression in cases where 3 and 10 biomarkers are permitted. When specificity is fixed at 0.9, ML approaches produced a sensitivity of 0.240 (3 biomarkers) and 0.520 (10 biomarkers), while standard logistic regression provided a sensitivity of 0.000 (3 biomarkers) and 0.040 (10 biomarkers). We also noted that causal-based methods for biomarker selection proved to be the most performant when fewer biomarkers were permitted, while univariate feature selection was the most performant when a greater number of biomarkers were permitted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lirong Wu, Yijun Tian, Haitao Lin, Yufei Huang, Siyuan Li, Nitesh V Chawla, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein-protein bindings play a key role in a variety of fundamental biological processes, and thus predicting the effects of amino acid mutations on protein-protein binding is crucial. To tackle the scarcity of annotated mutation data, pre-training with massive unlabeled data has emerged as a promising solution. However, this process faces a series of challenges: (1) complex higher-order dependencies among multiple (more than paired) structural scales have not yet been fully captured; (2) it is rarely explored how mutations alter the local conformation of the surrounding microenvironment; (3) pre-training is costly, both in data size and computational burden. In this paper, we first construct a hierarchical prompt codebook to record common microenvironmental patterns at different structural scales independently. Then, we develop a novel codebook pre-training task, namely masked microenvironment modeling, to model the joint distribution of each mutation with their residue types, angular statistics, and local conformational changes in the microenvironment. With the constructed prompt codebook, we encode the microenvironment around each mutation into multiple hierarchical prompts and combine them to flexibly provide information to wild-type and mutated protein complexes about their microenvironmental differences. Such a hierarchical prompt learning framework has demonstrated superior performance and training efficiency over state-of-the-art pre-training-based methods in mutation effect prediction and a case study of optimizing human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Dowling, Maxwell T. West, Angus Southwell, Azar C. Nakhl, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman, Kavan Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently quantum chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianglin Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) for dynamic systems whose nonlinearity and uncertainty are modelled by deep neural networks (NNs), under input and state constraints. Since the NN output contains a high-order complex nonlinearity of the system state and control input, the MPC problem is nonlinear and challenging to solve for real-time control. This paper proposes two types of methods for solving the MPC problem: the mixed integer programming (MIP) method which produces an exact solution to the nonlinear MPC, and linear relaxation (LR) methods which generally give suboptimal solutions but are much computationally cheaper. Extensive numerical simulation for an inverted pendulum system modelled by ReLU NNs of various sizes is used to demonstrate and compare performance of the MIP and LR methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Narjes Nourzad, Bhaskar Krishnamachari</p>
<p>Abstract: In dynamic and resource-constrained environments, such as multi-hop wireless mesh networks, traditional routing protocols often falter by relying on predetermined paths that prove ineffective in unpredictable link conditions. Shortest Anypath routing offers a solution by adapting routing decisions based on real-time link conditions. However, the effectiveness of such routing is fundamentally dependent on the quality and reliability of the available links, and predicting these variables with certainty is challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the Deterministic Sequencing of Exploration and Exploitation (DSEE), a multi-armed bandit algorithm, to address the need for accurate and real-time estimation of link delivery probabilities. This approach augments the reliability and resilience of the Shortest Anypath routing in the face of fluctuating link conditions. By coupling DSEE with Anypath routing, this algorithm continuously learns and ensures accurate delivery probability estimation and selects the most suitable way to efficiently route packets while maintaining a provable near-logarithmic regret bound. We also theoretically prove that our proposed scheme offers better regret scaling with respect to the network size than the previously proposed Thompson Sampling-based Opportunistic Routing (TSOR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayan Bandyapadhyay, Eden Chlamt\'a\v{c}, Yury Makarychev, Ali Vakilian</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study pairwise fair clustering with $\ell \ge 2$ groups, where for every cluster $C$ and every group $i \in [\ell]$, the number of points in $C$ from group $i$ must be at most $t$ times the number of points in $C$ from any other group $j \in [\ell]$, for a given integer $t$. To the best of our knowledge, only bi-criteria approximation and exponential-time algorithms follow for this problem from the prior work on fair clustering problems when $\ell > 2$. In our work, focusing on the $\ell > 2$ case, we design the first polynomial-time $(t^{\ell}\cdot \ell\cdot k)^{O(\ell)}$-approximation for this problem with $k$-median cost that does not violate the fairness constraints. We complement our algorithmic result by providing hardness of approximation results, which show that our problem even when $\ell=2$ is almost as hard as the popular uniform capacitated $k$-median, for which no polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation factor of $o(\log k)$ is known.</p>

We employ a holistic strategy by leveraging cutting-edge pre-trained models in multiple choice architecture, and diversify the training data with Sentence and Word Puzzle datasets. To gain further improvement, we fine-tuned the model with synthetic humor/jokes dataset and the RiddleSense dataset which helped augmenting the model's lateral thinking abilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Jin, Prasanna Balaprakash, Allen Zou, Pieter Ghysels, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan, Adam Mate, Arthur Barnes, Russell Bent</p>
<p>Abstract: The threat of geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) to the reliable operation of the bulk energy system has spurred the development of effective strategies for mitigating their impacts. One such approach involves placing transformer neutral blocking devices, which interrupt the path of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to limit their impact. The high cost of these devices and the sparsity of transformers that experience high GICs during GMD events, however, calls for a sparse placement strategy that involves high computational cost. To address this challenge, we developed a physics-informed heterogeneous graph neural network (PIHGNN) for solving the graph-based dc-blocker placement problem. Our approach combines a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to capture the diverse types of nodes and edges in ac/dc networks and incorporates the physical laws of the power grid. We train the PIHGNN model using a surrogate power flow model and validate it using case studies. Results demonstrate that PIHGNN can effectively and efficiently support the deployment of GIC dc-current blockers, ensuring the continued supply of electricity to meet societal demands. Our approach has the potential to contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient power grids capable of withstanding the growing threat that GMDs pose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuotao Diao, Suvrajeet Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic programming models can lead to very large-scale optimization problems for which it may be impossible to enumerate all possible scenarios. In such cases, one adopts a sampling-based solution methodology in which case the reliability of the resulting decisions may be suspect. For such instances, it is advisable to adopt methodologies that promote variance reduction. One such approach goes under a framework known as "compromise decision", which requires multiple replications of the solution procedure. This paper studies the reliability of stochastic programming solutions resulting from the "compromise decision" process. This process is characterized by minimizing an aggregation of objective function approximations across replications, presumably conducted in parallel. We refer to the post-parallel-processing problem as the problem of "compromise decision". We quantify the reliability of compromise decisions by estimating the expectation and variance of the "pessimistic distance" of sampled instances from the set of true optimal decisions. Such pessimistic distance is defined as an estimate of the largest possible distance of the solution of the sampled instance from the "true" optimal solution set. The Rademacher average of instances is used to bound the sample complexity of the compromise decision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew J Fox, Michael D. Graham</p>
<p>Abstract: The dynamics of flexible filaments entrained in flow, important for understanding many biological and industrial processes, are computationally expensive to model with full-physics simulations. This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as an unnecessarily expanded training set, computational inefficiency from dumping the KV cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, we propose a new paradigm in fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation, called SimulMask. It utilizes a novel attention mask technique that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention connections under a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on three language pairs when averaged across four different latency regimes while reducing the computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Song, Yingfang Yuan, Kaiwen Chang, Bing Xu, Jin Xuan, Wei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: To advance the circular economy (CE), it is crucial to gain insights into the evolution of public sentiments, cognitive pathways of the masses concerning circular products and digital technology, and recognise the primary concerns. To achieve this, we collected data related to the CE from diverse platforms including Twitter, Reddit, and The Guardian. This comprehensive data collection spanned across three distinct strata of the public: the general public, professionals, and official sources. Subsequently, we utilised three topic models on the collected data. Topic modelling represents a type of data-driven and machine learning approach for text mining, capable of automatically categorising a large number of documents into distinct semantic groups. Simultaneously, these groups are described by topics, and these topics can aid in understanding the semantic content of documents at a high level. However, the performance of topic modelling may vary depending on different hyperparameter values. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a framework for topic modelling with hyperparameter optimisation for CE and conducted a series of systematic experiments to ensure that topic models are set with appropriate hyperparameters and to gain insights into the correlations between the CE and public opinion based on well-established models. The results of this study indicate that concerns about sustainability and economic impact persist across all three datasets. Official sources demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the application and regulation of CE. To the best of our knowledge, this study is pioneering in investigating various levels of public opinions concerning CE through topic modelling with the exploration of hyperparameter optimisation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of open benchmarking platforms could greatly accelerate the adoption of AI agents in retail. This paper presents comprehensive simulations of customer shopping behaviors for the purpose of benchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) agents that optimize coupon targeting. The difficulty of this learning problem is largely driven by the sparsity of customer purchase events. We trained agents using offline batch data comprising summarized customer purchase histories to help mitigate this effect. Our experiments revealed that contextual bandit and deep RL methods that are less prone to over-fitting the sparse reward distributions significantly outperform static policies. This study offers a practical framework for simulating AI agents that optimize the entire retail customer journey. It aims to inspire the further development of simulation tools for retail AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rya Sanovar, Srikant Bharadwaj, Renee St. Amant, Victor R\"uhle, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have emerged as one of the most widely used architectures for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation. The size of the state-of-the-art models has increased steadily reaching billions of parameters. These huge models are memory hungry and incur significant inference latency even on cutting edge AI-accelerators, such as GPUs. Specifically, the time and memory complexity of the attention operation is quadratic in terms of the total context length, i.e., prompt and output tokens. Thus, several optimizations such as key-value tensor caching and FlashAttention computation have been proposed to deliver the low latency demands of applications relying on such large models. However, these techniques do not cater to the computationally distinct nature of different phases during inference.
  To that end, we propose LeanAttention, a scalable technique of computing self-attention for the token-generation phase (decode-phase) of decoder-only transformer models. LeanAttention enables scaling the attention mechanism implementation for the challenging case of long context lengths by re-designing the execution flow for the decode-phase. We identify that the associative property of online softmax can be treated as a reduction operation thus allowing us to parallelize the attention computation over these large context lengths. We extend the "stream-K" style reduction of tiled calculation to self-attention to enable parallel computation resulting in an average of 2.6x attention execution speedup over FlashAttention-2 and up to 8.33x speedup for 512k context lengths.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computational marketing has become increasingly important in today's digital world, facing challenges such as massive heterogeneous data, multi-channel customer journeys, and limited marketing budgets. In this paper, we propose a general framework for marketing AI systems, the Neural Optimization with Adaptive Heuristics (NOAH) framework.

We describe key modules of the NOAH framework, including prediction, optimization, and adaptive heuristics, providing examples for bidding and content optimization. We then detail the successful application of NOAH to LinkedIn's email marketing system, showcasing significant wins over the legacy ranking system. Additionally, we share details and insights that are broadly useful, particularly on: (i) addressing delayed feedback with lifetime value, (ii) performing large-scale linear programming with randomization, (iii) improving retrieval with audience expansion, (iv) reducing signal dilution in targeting tests, and (v) handling zero-inflated heavy-tail metrics in statistical testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Liang, Wei Xiang, Bang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims at determining the existence of a causal relation between two events. Although recent prompt learning-based approaches have shown promising improvements on the ECI task, their performance are often subject to the delicate design of multiple prompts and the positive correlations between the main task and derivate tasks. The in-context learning paradigm provides explicit guidance for label prediction in the prompt learning paradigm, alleviating its reliance on complex prompts and derivative tasks. However, it does not distinguish between positive and negative demonstrations for analogy learning. Motivated from such considerations, this paper proposes an In-Context Contrastive Learning (ICCL) model that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the effectiveness of both positive and negative demonstrations. Additionally, we apply contrastive learning to event pairs to better facilitate event causality identification. Our ICCL is evaluated on the widely used corpora, including the EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank, and results show significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeik Jeong, Tai-Yeon Ku, Wan-Ki Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy storage devices, such as batteries, thermal energy storages, and hydrogen systems, can help mitigate climate change by ensuring a more stable and sustainable power supply. To maximize the effectiveness of such energy storage, determining the appropriate charging and discharging amounts for each time period is crucial. Reinforcement learning is preferred over traditional optimization for the control of energy storage due to its ability to adapt to dynamic and complex environments. However, the continuous nature of charging and discharging levels in energy storage poses limitations for discrete reinforcement learning, and time-varying feasible charge-discharge range based on state of charge (SoC) variability also limits the conventional continuous reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a continuous reinforcement learning approach that takes into account the time-varying feasible charge-discharge range. An additional objective function was introduced for learning the feasible action range for each time period, supplementing the objectives of training the actor for policy learning and the critic for value learning. This actively promotes the utilization of energy storage by preventing them from getting stuck in suboptimal states, such as continuous full charging or discharging. This is achieved through the enforcement of the charging and discharging levels into the feasible action range. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method further maximized the effectiveness of energy storage by actively enhancing its utilization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kris Sankaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Society's capacity for algorithmic problem-solving has never been greater. Artificial Intelligence is now applied across more domains than ever, a consequence of powerful abstractions, abundant data, and accessible software. As capabilities have expanded, so have risks, with models often deployed without fully understanding their potential impacts. Interpretable and interactive machine learning aims to make complex models more transparent and controllable, enhancing user agency. This review synthesizes key principles from the growing literature in this field.
  We first introduce precise vocabulary for discussing interpretability, like the distinction between glass box and explainable algorithms. We then explore connections to classical statistical and design principles, like parsimony and the gulfs of interaction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Yang, Jiawang Bai, Kuofeng Gao, Yong Yang, Yiming Li, Shu-tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the power of vision transformers, a new learning paradigm, pre-training and then prompting, makes it more efficient and effective to address downstream visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically, an extra prompt token, called the switch token in this work, can turn the backdoor mode on, i.e., converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode, a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API, since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode, thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pre-trained model, our proposed attack, named SWARM, learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents, and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides, we utilize the cross-mode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack, i.e., achieving 95%+ attack success rate, and also being hard to be detected and removed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Ji, Yang Xiang, Juntao Li, Wei Chen, Zhongyi Liu, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven advances in natural language processing. Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Pang, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based encoder-decoder models have demonstrated impressive results in chemical reaction prediction tasks. However, these models typically rely on pretraining using tens of millions of unlabelled molecules, which can be time-consuming and GPU-intensive. One of the central questions we aim to answer in this work is: Can FlanT5 and ByT5, the encode-decoder models pretrained solely on language data, be effectively specialised for organic reaction prediction through task-specific fine-tuning? We conduct a systematic empirical study on several key issues of the process, including tokenisation, the impact of (SMILES-oriented) pretraining, fine-tuning sample efficiency, and decoding algorithms at inference. Our key findings indicate that although being pretrained only on language tasks, FlanT5 and ByT5 provide a solid foundation to fine-tune for reaction prediction, and thus become `chemistry domain compatible' in the process. This suggests that GPU-intensive and expensive pretraining on a large dataset of unlabelled molecules may be useful yet not essential to leverage the power of language models for chemistry. All our models achieve comparable Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy although some variation across different models does exist. Notably, tokenisation and vocabulary trimming slightly affect final performance but can speed up training and inference; The most efficient greedy decoding strategy is very competitive while only marginal gains can be achieved from more sophisticated decoding algorithms. In summary, we evaluate FlanT5 and ByT5 across several dimensions and benchmark their impact on organic reaction prediction, which may guide more effective use of these state-of-the-art language models for chemistry-related tasks in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzong Pi, Samuel Filgueira da Silva, Mehmet Fatih Ozkan, Abhishek Gupta, Marcello Canova</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient parameter identification of electrochemical models is crucial for accurate monitoring and control of lithium-ion cells. This process becomes challenging when applied to complex models that rely on a considerable number of interdependent parameters that affect the output response. Gradient-based and metaheuristic optimization techniques, although previously employed for this task, are limited by their lack of robustness, high computational costs, and susceptibility to local minima. In this study, Bayesian Optimization is used for tuning the dynamic parameters of an electrochemical equivalent circuit battery model (E-ECM) for a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC)-graphite cell. The performance of the Bayesian Optimization is compared with baseline methods based on gradient-based and metaheuristic approaches. The robustness of the parameter optimization method is tested by performing verification using an experimental drive cycle. The results indicate that Bayesian Optimization outperforms Gradient Descent and PSO optimization techniques, achieving reductions on average testing loss by 28.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Moreover, Bayesian optimization significantly reduces the variance in testing loss by 95.8% and 72.7%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Cheng, Qin Yang, Liyang Wang, Ao Xiang, Jingyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of globalized financial markets, commercial banks are confronted with an escalating magnitude of credit risk, thereby imposing heightened requisites upon the security of bank assets and financial stability. This study harnesses advanced neural network techniques, notably the Backpropagation (BP) neural network, to pioneer a novel model for preempting credit risk in commercial banks. The discourse initially scrutinizes conventional financial risk preemptive models, such as ARMA, ARCH, and Logistic regression models, critically analyzing their real-world applications. Subsequently, the exposition elaborates on the construction process of the BP neural network model, encompassing network architecture design, activation function selection, parameter initialization, and objective function construction. Through comparative analysis, the superiority of neural network models in preempting credit risk in commercial banks is elucidated. The experimental segment selects specific bank data, validating the model's predictive accuracy and practicality. Research findings evince that this model efficaciously enhances the foresight and precision of credit risk management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nonlinear system identification remains an important open challenge across research and academia. Large numbers of novel approaches are seen published each year, each presenting improvements or extensions to existing methods. It is natural, therefore, to consider how one might choose between these competing models. Benchmark datasets provide one clear way to approach this question. However, to make meaningful inference based on benchmark performance it is important to understand how well a new method performs comparatively to results available with well-established methods. This paper presents a set of ten baseline techniques and their relative performances on five popular benchmarks. The aim of this contribution is to stimulate thought and discussion regarding objective comparison of identification methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the use of training compute thresholds as a tool for governing artificial intelligence (AI) systems. We argue that compute thresholds serve as a valuable trigger for further evaluation of AI models, rather than being the sole determinant of the regulation. Key advantages of compute thresholds include their correlation with model capabilities and risks, quantifiability, ease of measurement, robustness to circumvention, knowability before model development and deployment, potential for external verification, and targeted scope. Compute thresholds provide a practical starting point for identifying potentially high-risk models and can be used as an initial filter in AI governance frameworks alongside other sector-specific regulations and broader governance measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Gabor, Rafa{\l} Zdunek</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are among the most widely used machine learning models for computer vision tasks, such as image classification. To improve the efficiency of CNNs, many CNNs compressing approaches have been developed. Low-rank methods approximate the original convolutional kernel with a sequence of smaller convolutional kernels, which leads to reduced storage and time complexities. In this study, we propose a novel low-rank CNNs compression method that is based on reduced storage direct tensor ring decomposition (RSDTR). The proposed method offers a higher circular mode permutation flexibility, and it is characterized by large parameter and FLOPS compression rates, while preserving a good classification accuracy of the compressed network. The experiments, performed on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, clearly demonstrate the efficiency of RSDTR in comparison to other state-of-the-art CNNs compression approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Karanov, Chin-Hung Chen, Yan Wu, Alex Young, Wim van Houtum</p>
<p>Abstract: We developed machine learning approaches for data-driven trellis-based soft symbol detection in coded transmission over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels in presence of bursty impulsive noise (IN), for example encountered in wireless digital broadcasting systems and vehicular communications. This enabled us to obtain optimized detectors based on the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm while circumventing the use of full channel state information (CSI) for computing likelihoods and trellis state transition probabilities. First, we extended the application of the neural network (NN)-aided BCJR, recently proposed for ISI channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Although suitable for estimating likelihoods via labeling of transmission sequences, the BCJR-NN method does not provide a framework for learning the trellis state transitions. In addition to detection over the joint ISI and IN states we also focused on another scenario where trellis transitions are not trivial: detection for the ISI channel with AWGN with inaccurate knowledge of the channel memory at the receiver. Without access to the accurate state transition matrix, the BCJR- NN performance significantly degrades in both settings. To this end, we devised an alternative approach for data-driven BCJR detection based on the unsupervised learning of a hidden Markov model (HMM). The BCJR-HMM allowed us to optimize both the likelihood function and the state transition matrix without labeling. Moreover, we demonstrated the viability of a hybrid NN and HMM BCJR detection where NN is used for learning the likelihoods, while the state transitions are optimized via HMM. While reducing the required prior channel knowledge, the examined data-driven detectors with learned trellis state transitions achieve bit error rates close to the optimal full CSI-based BCJR, significantly outperforming detection with inaccurate CSI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrzej Ruszczy\'nski, Shangzhe Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems involving an expected value of a nonlinear function of a base random vector and a conditional expectation of another function depending on the base random vector, a dependent random vector, and the decision variables. We call such problems conditional stochastic optimization problems. They arise in many applications, such as uplift modeling, reinforcement learning, and contextual optimization. We propose a specialized single time-scale stochastic method for nonconvex constrained conditional stochastic optimization problems with a Lipschitz smooth outer function and a generalized differentiable inner function. In the method, we approximate the inner conditional expectation with a rich parametric model whose mean squared error satisfies a stochastic version of a {\L}ojasiewicz condition. The model is used by an inner learning algorithm. The main feature of our approach is that unbiased stochastic estimates of the directions used by the method can be generated with one observation from the joint distribution per iteration, which makes it applicable to real-time learning. The directions, however, are not gradients or subgradients of any overall objective function. We prove the convergence of the method with probability one, using the method of differential inclusions and a specially designed Lyapunov function, involving a stochastic generalization of the Bregman distance. Finally, a numerical illustration demonstrates the viability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azadeh Khaleghi</p>
<p>Abstract: A more general formulation of the linear bandit problem is considered to allow for dependencies over time. Specifically, it is assumed that there exists an unknown $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stationary $\varphi$-mixing sequence of parameters $(\theta_t,~t \in \mathbb{N})$ which gives rise to pay-offs. This instance of the problem can be viewed as a generalization of both the classical linear bandits with iid noise, and the finite-armed restless bandits. In light of the well-known computational hardness of optimal policies for restless bandits, an approximation is proposed whose error is shown to be controlled by the $\varphi$-dependence between consecutive $\theta_t$. An optimistic algorithm, called LinMix-UCB, is proposed for the case where $\theta_t$ has an exponential mixing rate. The proposed algorithm is shown to incur a sub-linear regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{d n\mathrm{polylog}(n) }\right)$ with respect to an oracle that always plays a multiple of $\mathbb{E}\theta_t$. The main challenge in this setting is to ensure that the exploration-exploitation strategy is robust against long-range dependencies. The proposed method relies on Berbee's coupling lemma to carefully select near-independent samples and construct confidence ellipsoids around empirical estimates of $\mathbb{E}\theta_t$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable attention recently due to their outstanding comprehension and reasoning capabilities, leading to great progress in many fields. The advancement of LLM techniques also offers promising opportunities to automate many tasks in the telecommunication (telecom) field. After pre-training and fine-tuning, LLMs can perform diverse downstream tasks based on human instructions, paving the way to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled 6G. Given the great potential of LLM technologies, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-enabled telecom networks. In particular, we first present LLM fundamentals, including model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, model evaluation, and telecom deployment. Then, we introduce LLM-enabled key techniques and telecom applications in terms of generation, classification, optimization, and prediction problems. Specifically, the LLM-enabled generation applications include telecom domain knowledge, code, and network configuration generation. After that, the LLM-based classification applications involve network security, text, image, and traffic classification problems. Moreover, multiple LLM-enabled optimization techniques are introduced, such as automated reward function design for reinforcement learning and verbal reinforcement learning. Furthermore, for LLM-aided prediction problems, we discussed time-series prediction models and multi-modality prediction problems for telecom. Finally, we highlight the challenges and identify the future directions of LLM-enabled telecom networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, new types of interference in electric vehicles (EVs), such as converters switching and/or battery chargers, have been found to degrade the performance of wireless digital transmission systems. Measurements show that such an interference is characterized by impulsive behavior and is widely varying in time. This paper uses recorded data from our EV testbed to analyze the impulsive interference in the digital audio broadcasting band. Moreover, we use our analysis to obtain a corresponding interference model. In particular, we studied the temporal characteristics of the interference and confirmed that its amplitude indeed exhibits an impulsive behavior. Our results show that impulsive events span successive received signal samples and thus indicate a bursty nature. To this end, we performed a data-driven modification of a well-established model for bursty impulsive interference, the Markov-Middleton model, to produce synthetic noise realization. We investigate the optimal symbol detector design based on the proposed model and show significant performance gains compared to the conventional detector based on the additive white Gaussian noise assumption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation using diffusion models have significantly improved the quality of generated images and expanded the ability to depict a wide range of objects. However, ensuring that these models adhere closely to the text prompts remains a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly pronounced when trying to generate photorealistic images of humans. Without significant prompt engineering efforts models often produce unrealistic images and typically fail to incorporate the full extent of the prompt information. This limitation can be largely attributed to the nature of captions accompanying the images used in training large scale diffusion models, which typically prioritize contextual information over details related to the person's appearance. In this paper we address this issue by introducing a training-free pipeline designed to generate accurate appearance descriptions from images of people. We apply this method to create approximately 250,000 captions for publicly available face datasets. We then use these synthetic captions to fine-tune a text-to-image diffusion model. Our results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the model's ability to generate high-quality, realistic human faces and enhances adherence to the given prompts, compared to the baseline model. We share our synthetic captions, pretrained checkpoints and training code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unconstrained optimization problems are typically solved using iterative methods, which often depend on line search techniques to determine optimal step lengths in each iteration. This paper introduces a novel line search approach. Traditional line search methods, aimed at determining optimal step lengths, often discard valuable data from the search process and focus on refining step length intervals. This paper proposes a more efficient method using Bayesian optimization, which utilizes all available data points, i.e., function values and gradients, to guide the search towards a potential global minimum. This new approach more effectively explores the search space, leading to better solution quality. It is also easy to implement and integrate into existing frameworks. Tested on the challenging CUTEst test set, it demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, solving more problems to optimality with equivalent resource usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> D. Subhalingam, Keshav Kolluru,  Mausam, Saurabh Singal</p>
<p>Abstract: In the e-commerce domain, the accurate extraction of attribute-value pairs from product listings (e.g., Brand: Apple) is crucial for enhancing search and recommendation systems. The automation of this extraction process is challenging due to the vast diversity of product categories and their respective attributes, compounded by the lack of extensive, accurately annotated training datasets and the demand for low latency to meet the real-time needs of e-commerce platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce GenToC, a novel two-stage model for extracting attribute-value pairs from product titles. GenToC is designed to train with partially-labeled data, leveraging incomplete attribute-value pairs and obviating the need for a fully annotated dataset. Moreover, we introduce a bootstrapping method that enables GenToC to progressively refine and expand its training dataset. This enhancement substantially improves the quality of data available for training other neural network models that are typically faster but are inherently less capable than GenToC in terms of their capacity to handle partially-labeled data. By supplying an enriched dataset for training, GenToC significantly advances the performance of these alternative models, making them more suitable for real-time deployment. Our results highlight the unique capability of GenToC to learn from a limited set of labeled data and to contribute to the training of more efficient models, marking a significant leap forward in the automated extraction of attribute-value pairs from product titles. GenToC has been successfully integrated into India's largest B2B e-commerce platform, IndiaMART.com, achieving a significant increase of 21.1% in recall over the existing deployed system while maintaining a high precision of 89.5% in this challenging task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple imputation (MI) models can be improved by including auxiliary covariates (AC), but their performance in high-dimensional data is not well understood. We aimed to develop and compare high-dimensional MI (HDMI) approaches using structured and natural language processing (NLP)-derived AC in studies with partially observed confounders. We conducted a plasmode simulation study using data from opioid vs. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) initiators (X) with observed serum creatinine labs (Z2) and time-to-acute kidney injury as outcome. We simulated 100 cohorts with a null treatment effect, including X, Z2, atrial fibrillation (U), and 13 other investigator-derived confounders (Z1) in the outcome generation. We then imposed missingness (MZ2) on 50% of Z2 measurements as a function of Z2 and U and created different HDMI candidate AC using structured and NLP-derived features. We mimicked scenarios where U was unobserved by omitting it from all AC candidate sets. Using LASSO, we data-adaptively selected HDMI covariates associated with Z2 and MZ2 for MI, and with U to include in propensity score models. The treatment effect was estimated following propensity score matching in MI datasets and we benchmarked HDMI approaches against a baseline imputation and complete case analysis with Z1 only. HDMI using claims data showed the lowest bias (0.072). Combining claims and sentence embeddings led to an improvement in the efficiency displaying the lowest root-mean-squared-error (0.173) and coverage (94%). NLP-derived AC alone did not perform better than baseline MI. HDMI approaches may decrease bias in studies with partially observed confounders where missingness depends on unobserved factors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayanth Bhargav, Mahsa Ghasemi, Shreyas Sundaram</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting an optimal subset of information sources for a hypothesis testing/classification task where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses, based on finite observation samples from the sources. In order to characterize the learning performance, we propose a misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification errors. In a centralized Bayesian learning setting, we study two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis remains bounded and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited budget to minimize the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of these combinatorial optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability performance guarantees for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of misclassification. We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for the greedy algorithms for both the information set selection problems. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results over several randomly generated instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srinivasan Arunachalam, Arkopal Dutt, Francisco Escudero Guti\'errez, Carlos Palazuelos</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning low-degree quantum objects up to $\varepsilon$-error in $\ell_2$-distance. We show the following results: $(i)$ unknown $n$-qubit degree-$d$ (in the Pauli basis) quantum channels and unitaries can be learned using $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ queries (independent of $n$), $(ii)$ polynomials $p:\{-1,1\}^n\rightarrow [-1,1]$ arising from $d$-query quantum algorithms can be classically learned from $O((1/\varepsilon)^d\cdot \log n)$ many random examples $(x,p(x))$ (which implies learnability even for $d=O(\log n)$), and $(iii)$ degree-$d$ polynomials $p:\{-1,1\}^n\to [-1,1]$ can be learned through $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ queries to a quantum unitary $U_p$ that block-encodes $p$. Our main technical contributions are new Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities for quantum channels and completely bounded~polynomials.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10944">Probabilistic transfer learning methodology to expedite high fidelity simulation of reactive flows</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno S. Soriano, Ki Sung Jung, Tarek Echekki, Jacqueline H. Chen, Mohammad Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milo\v{s} Nikoli\'c, Enrique Torres Sanchez, Jiahui Wang, Ali Hadi Zadeh, Mostafa Mahmoud, Ameer Abdelhadi, Kareem Ibrahim, Andreas Moshovos</p>
<p>Abstract: The transfer of tensors from/to memory during neural network training dominates time and energy. To improve energy efficiency and performance, research has been exploring ways to use narrower data representations. So far, these attempts relied on user-directed trial-and-error to achieve convergence. We present methods that relieve users from this responsibility. Our methods dynamically adjust the size and format of the floating-point containers used for activations and weights during training, achieving adaptivity across three dimensions: i) which datatype to use, ii) on which tensor, and iii) how it changes over time. The different meanings and distributions of exponent and mantissas lead us to tailored approaches for each. We present two lossy pairs of methods to eliminate as many mantissa and exponent bits as possible without affecting accuracy. Quantum Mantissa and Quantum Exponent are machine learning compression methods that tap into the gradient descent algorithm to learn the minimal mantissa and exponent bitlengths on a per-layer granularity. They automatically learn that many tensors can use just 1 or 2 mantissa bits and 3 or 4 exponent bits. Overall, the two machine learning methods reduce the footprint by $4.74\times$. Alternatively, BitWave observes changes in the loss function during training to adjust mantissa and exponent bitlengths network-wide, yielding a $3.19\times$ reduction in footprint. Finally, we present an optional method, Gecko, to exploit the naturally emerging, lop-sided exponent distribution to losslessly compress resulting exponents from Quantum Exponent or BitWave and, on average, improve compression rates to $5.64\times$ and $4.56\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinbo Bai, Amrit Singh Bedi, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) in continuous state-actions spaces where the goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward subject to some constraints. We propose a novel Conservative Natural Policy Gradient Primal-Dual Algorithm (C-NPG-PD) to achieve zero constraint violation while achieving state of the art convergence results for the objective value function. For general policy parametrization, we prove convergence of value function to global optimal upto an approximation error due to restricted policy class. We even improve the sample complexity of existing constrained NPG-PD algorithm \cite{Ding2020} from $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish zero constraint violation with Natural policy gradient style algorithms for infinite horizon discounted CMDPs. We demonstrate the merits of proposed algorithm via experimental evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Diaw, M. McKerns, I. Sagert, L. G. Stanton, M. S. Murillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly used to build computationally inexpensive surrogates for complex physical models. The predictive capability of these surrogates suffers when data are noisy, sparse, or time-dependent. As we are interested in finding a surrogate that provides valid predictions of any potential future model evaluations, we introduce an online learning method empowered by optimizer-driven sampling. The method has two advantages over current approaches. First, it ensures that all turning points on the model response surface are included in the training data. Second, after any new model evaluations, surrogates are tested and "retrained" (updated) if the "score" drops below a validity threshold. Tests on benchmark functions reveal that optimizer-directed sampling generally outperforms traditional sampling methods in terms of accuracy around local extrema, even when the scoring metric favors overall accuracy. We apply our method to simulations of nuclear matter to demonstrate that highly accurate surrogates for the nuclear equation of state can be reliably auto-generated from expensive calculations using a few model evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shourav B. Rabbani, Ivan V. Medri, Manar D. Samad</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods are primarily proposed for supervised learning of images or text with limited applications to clustering problems. In contrast, tabular data with heterogeneous features pose unique challenges in representation learning, where deep learning has yet to replace traditional machine learning. This paper addresses these challenges in developing one of the first deep clustering methods for tabular data: Gaussian Cluster Embedding in Autoencoder Latent Space (G-CEALS). G-CEALS is an unsupervised deep clustering framework for learning the parameters of multivariate Gaussian cluster distributions by iteratively updating individual cluster weights. The G-CEALS method presents average rank orderings of 2.9(1.7) and 2.8(1.7) based on clustering accuracy and adjusted Rand index (ARI) scores on sixteen tabular data sets, respectively, and outperforms nine state-of-the-art clustering methods. G-CEALS substantially improves clustering performance compared to traditional K-means and GMM, which are still de facto methods for clustering tabular data. Similar computationally efficient and high-performing deep clustering frameworks are imperative to reap the myriad benefits of deep learning on tabular data over traditional machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic control flow is an important technique often used to design expressive and efficient deep learning computations for applications such as text parsing, machine translation, exiting early out of deep models and so on. The control flow divergence resulting from dynamic control flow makes batching, an important optimization enabling high throughput and hardware utilization, difficult to perform manually. In this paper, we present ACRoBat, a framework that enables efficient automatic batching for dynamic deep learning computations by performing hybrid static+dynamic compiler optimizations and end-to-end tensor code generation. ACRoBat performs up to 8.5X better than DyNet, a state-of-the-art framework for automatic batching, on an Nvidia GeForce GPU.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning methods have seen a wide range of successful applications across different industries. Up until now, applications to physical simulations such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), have been limited to simple test-cases of minor industrial relevance. This paper demonstrates the development of a novel deep learning framework for real-time predictions of the impact of manufacturing and build variations on the overall performance of axial compressors in gas turbines, with a focus on tip clearance variations. The associated scatter in efficiency can significantly increase the CO2 emissions, thus being of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed C(NN)FD architecture achieves in real-time accuracy comparable to the CFD benchmark. Predicting the flow field and using it to calculate the corresponding overall performance renders the methodology generalisable, while filtering only relevant parts of the CFD solution makes the methodology scalable to industrial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anchen Sun, Elizabeth J. Franzmann, Zhibin Chen, Xiaodong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image classification have demonstrated that contrastive learning (CL) can aid in further learning tasks by acquiring good feature representation from a limited number of data samples. In this paper, we applied CL to tumor transcriptomes and clinical data to learn feature representations in a low-dimensional space. We then utilized these learned features to train a classifier to categorize tumors into a high- or low-risk group of recurrence. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we demonstrated that CL can significantly improve classification accuracy. Specifically, our CL-based classifiers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 for 14 types of cancer, and an AUC greater than 0.9 for 2 types of cancer. We also developed CL-based Cox (CLCox) models for predicting cancer prognosis. Our CLCox models trained with the TCGA data outperformed existing methods significantly in predicting the prognosis of 19 types of cancer under consideration. The performance of CLCox models and CL-based classifiers trained with TCGA lung and prostate cancer data were validated using the data from two independent cohorts. We also show that the CLCox model trained with the whole transcriptome significantly outperforms the Cox model trained with the 21 genes of Oncotype DX that is in clinical use for breast cancer patients. CL-based classifiers and CLCox models for 19 types of cancer are publicly available and can be used to predict cancer prognosis using the RNA-seq transcriptome of an individual tumor. Python codes for model training and testing are also publicly accessible, and can be applied to train new CL-based models using gene expression data of tumors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Frohmann, Carolin Holtermann, Shahed Masoudian, Anne Lauscher, Navid Rekabsaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown considerable practical benefits, particularly when using language models (LMs). While this is commonly achieved by learning $n$ tasks under a joint optimization procedure, some methods, such as AdapterFusion, divide the problem into two stages: (i) task learning, where knowledge specific to a task is encapsulated within sets of parameters (e.g., adapters), and (ii) transfer, where this already learned knowledge is leveraged for a target task. This separation of concerns provides numerous benefits (e.g., promoting reusability). However, current two-stage MTL introduces a substantial number of additional parameters. We address this issue by leveraging the usefulness of linearly scaling the output representations of source adapters for transfer learning. We introduce ScaLearn, a simple and highly parameter-efficient two-stage MTL method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the source tasks by learning a minimal set of scaling parameters that enable effective transfer to a target task. Our experiments on three benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, and HumSet) and two encoder LMs show that ScaLearn consistently outperforms strong baselines with a small number of transfer parameters (~ $0.35$% of those of AdapterFusion). Remarkably, we observe that ScaLearn maintains its strong abilities even when further reducing parameters, achieving competitive results with only $8$ transfer parameters per target task. Our proposed approach thus demonstrates the power of simple scaling as a promise for more efficient task transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a discipline that applies algebraic topology techniques to analyze complex, multi-dimensional data. Although it is a relatively new field, TDA has been widely and successfully applied across various domains, such as medicine, materials science, and biology. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art of TDA within a dynamic and promising application area: industrial manufacturing and production, particularly within the Industry 4.0 context. We have conducted a rigorous and reproducible literature search focusing on TDA applications in industrial production and manufacturing settings. The identified works are categorized based on their application areas within the manufacturing process and the types of input data. We highlight the principal advantages of TDA tools in this context, address the challenges encountered and the future potential of the field. Furthermore, we identify TDA methods that are currently underexploited in specific industrial areas and discuss how their application could be beneficial, with the aim of stimulating further research in this field. This work seeks to bridge the theoretical advancements in TDA with the practical needs of industrial production. Our goal is to serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers applying TDA in industrial production and manufacturing systems. We advocate for the untapped potential of TDA in this domain and encourage continued exploration and research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Tambon, Foutse Khomh, Giuliano Antoniol</p>
<p>Abstract: To foster the verifiability and testability of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), an increasing number of methods for test case generation techniques are being developed.
  When confronted with testing DNN models, the user can apply any existing test generation technique. However, it needs to do so for each technique and each DNN model under test, which can be expensive. Therefore, a paradigm shift could benefit this testing process: rather than regenerating the test set independently for each DNN model under test, we could transfer from existing DNN models.
  This paper introduces GIST (Generated Inputs Sets Transferability), a novel approach for the efficient transfer of test sets. Given a property selected by a user (e.g., neurons covered, faults), GIST enables the selection of good test sets from the point of view of this property among available test sets. This allows the user to recover similar properties on the transferred test sets as he would have obtained by generating the test set from scratch with a test cases generation technique. Experimental results show that GIST can select effective test sets for the given property to transfer. Moreover, GIST scales better than reapplying test case generation techniques from scratch on DNN models under test.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt Gorbett, Hossein Shirazi, Indrakshi Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from the collective knowledge of data dispersed across private sources can provide neural networks with enhanced generalization capabilities. Federated learning, a method for collaboratively training a machine learning model across remote clients, achieves this by combining client models via the orchestration of a central server. However, current approaches face two critical limitations: i) they struggle to converge when client domains are sufficiently different, and ii) current aggregation techniques produce an identical global model for each client. In this work, we address these issues by reformulating the typical federated learning setup: rather than learning a single global model, we learn N models each optimized for a common objective. To achieve this, we apply a weighted distance minimization to model parameters shared in a peer-to-peer topology. The resulting framework, Iterative Parameter Alignment, applies naturally to the cross-silo setting, and has the following properties: (i) a unique solution for each participant, with the option to globally converge each model in the federation, and (ii) an optional early-stopping mechanism to elicit fairness among peers in collaborative learning settings. These characteristics jointly provide a flexible new framework for iteratively learning from peer models trained on disparate datasets. We find that the technique achieves competitive results on a variety of data partitions compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further, we show that the method is robust to divergent domains (i.e. disjoint classes across peers) where existing approaches struggle.</p>

However, in this work, we identify a vulnerability that enables models to be trained in both directions and on different tasks. Adversaries can exploit this capability to hide rogue models within seemingly legitimate models. In addition, in this work we show that neural networks can be taught to systematically memorize and retrieve specific samples from datasets. Together, these findings expose a novel method in which adversaries can exfiltrate datasets from protected learning environments under the guise of legitimate models. We focus on the data exfiltration attack and show that modern architectures can be used to secretly exfiltrate tens of thousands of samples with high fidelity, high enough to compromise data privacy and even train new models. Moreover, to mitigate this threat we propose a novel approach for detecting infected models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this "curse of memory" as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the forecasting accuracy of human experts versus Large Language Models (LLMs) in the retail sector, particularly during standard and promotional sales periods. Utilizing a controlled experimental setup with 123 human forecasters and five LLMs, including ChatGPT4, ChatGPT3.5, Bard, Bing, and Llama2, we evaluated forecasting precision through Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Our analysis centered on the effect of the following factors on forecasters performance: the supporting statistical model (baseline and advanced), whether the product was on promotion, and the nature of external impact. The findings indicate that LLMs do not consistently outperform humans in forecasting accuracy and that advanced statistical forecasting models do not uniformly enhance the performance of either human forecasters or LLMs. Both human and LLM forecasters exhibited increased forecasting errors, particularly during promotional periods and under the influence of positive external impacts. Our findings call for careful consideration when integrating LLMs into practical forecasting processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Zhe Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness are critical factors in process modeling and optimization for real-world engineering applications. Yet, conventional neural networks often fall short in addressing both simultaneously, or even separately. Drawing insights from natural physical systems and existing literature, it is known theoretically that an input convex architecture will enhance computational efficiency, while a Lipschitz-constrained architecture will bolster non-adversarial robustness. However, integrating both properties into one model is a nontrivial task, as enforcing one property may compromise the other one. Therefore, in this work, we develop a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks, that inherits the strengths of both convexity and Lipschitz continuity. This model is explicitly designed for fast and robust optimization-based tasks, which outperforms existing recurrent units in terms of computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness. Additionally, we have successfully implemented this model in various practical engineering applications, such as optimization of chemical processes and real-world solar irradiance prediction for Solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yang, Jian Tao, Jiafei Lyu, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration remains a critical issue in deep reinforcement learning for an agent to attain high returns in unknown environments. Although the prevailing exploration Random Network Distillation (RND) algorithm has been demonstrated to be effective in numerous environments, it often needs more discriminative power in bonus allocation. This paper highlights the "bonus inconsistency" issue within RND, pinpointing its primary limitation. To address this issue, we introduce the Distributional RND (DRND), a derivative of the RND. DRND enhances the exploration process by distilling a distribution of random networks and implicitly incorporating pseudo counts to improve the precision of bonus allocation. This refinement encourages agents to engage in more extensive exploration. Our method effectively mitigates the inconsistency issue without introducing significant computational overhead. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the original RND algorithm. Our method excels in challenging online exploration scenarios and effectively serves as an anti-exploration mechanism in D4RL offline tasks.

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanna Krasowski, Matthias Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: For safe operation, autonomous vehicles have to obey traffic rules that are set forth in legal documents formulated in natural language. Temporal logic is a suitable concept to formalize such traffic rules. Still, temporal logic rules often result in constraints that are hard to solve using optimization-based motion planners. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method to find motion plans for autonomous vehicles. However, vanilla RL algorithms are based on random exploration and do not automatically comply with traffic rules. Our approach accomplishes guaranteed rule-compliance by integrating temporal logic specifications into RL. Specifically, we consider the application of vessels on the open sea, which must adhere to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). To efficiently synthesize rule-compliant actions, we combine predicates based on set-based prediction with a statechart representing our formalized rules and their priorities. Action masking then restricts the RL agent to this set of verified rule-compliant actions. In numerical evaluations on critical maritime traffic situations, our agent always complies with the formalized legal rules and never collides while achieving a high goal-reaching rate during training and deployment. In contrast, vanilla and traffic rule-informed RL agents frequently violate traffic rules and collide even after training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqian Ye, Guangtao Zheng, Xu Cao, Yunsheng Ma, Aidong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems are known to be sensitive to spurious correlations between non-essential features of the inputs (e.g., background, texture, and secondary objects) and the corresponding labels. These features and their correlations with the labels are known as "spurious" because they tend to change with shifts in real-world data distributions, which can negatively impact the model's generalization and robustness. In this paper, we provide a review of this issue, along with a taxonomy of current state-of-the-art methods for addressing spurious correlations in machine learning models. Additionally, we summarize existing datasets, benchmarks, and metrics to aid future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of the recent advancements and future challenges in this field, aiming to provide valuable insights for researchers in the related domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewon Jung, Hongsun Jang, Jaeyong Song, Jinho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness of the neural network is a significant concern when it is applied to security-critical domains. In this situation, adversarial distillation is a promising option which aims to distill the robustness of the teacher network to improve the robustness of a small student network. Previous works pretrain the teacher network to make it robust against the adversarial examples aimed at itself. However, the adversarial examples are dependent on the parameters of the target network. The fixed teacher network inevitably degrades its robustness against the unseen transferred adversarial examples which target the parameters of the student network in the adversarial distillation process. We propose PeerAiD to make a peer network learn the adversarial examples of the student network instead of adversarial examples aimed at itself. PeerAiD is an adversarial distillation that trains the peer network and the student network simultaneously in order to specialize the peer network for defending the student network. We observe that such peer networks surpass the robustness of the pretrained robust teacher model against adversarial examples aimed at the student network. With this peer network and adversarial distillation, PeerAiD achieves significantly higher robustness of the student network with AutoAttack (AA) accuracy by up to 1.66%p and improves the natural accuracy of the student network by up to 4.72%p with ResNet-18 on TinyImageNet dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Lakey, Tim Schlippe</p>
<p>Abstract: Spacecraft operations are highly critical, demanding impeccable reliability and safety. Ensuring the optimal performance of a spacecraft requires the early detection and mitigation of anomalies, which could otherwise result in unit or mission failures. With the advent of deep learning, a surge of interest has been seen in leveraging these sophisticated algorithms for anomaly detection in space operations. This study aims to compare the efficacy of various deep learning architectures in detecting anomalies in spacecraft data. The deep learning models under investigation include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based architectures. Each of these models was trained and validated using a comprehensive dataset sourced from multiple spacecraft missions, encompassing diverse operational scenarios and anomaly types. Initial results indicate that while CNNs excel in identifying spatial patterns and may be effective for some classes of spacecraft data, LSTMs and RNNs show a marked proficiency in capturing temporal anomalies seen in time-series spacecraft telemetry. The Transformer-based architectures, given their ability to focus on both local and global contexts, have showcased promising results, especially in scenarios where anomalies are subtle and span over longer durations. Additionally, considerations such as computational efficiency, ease of deployment, and real-time processing capabilities were evaluated. While CNNs and LSTMs demonstrated a balance between accuracy and computational demands, Transformer architectures, though highly accurate, require significant computational resources. In conclusion, the choice of deep learning architecture for spacecraft anomaly detection is highly contingent on the nature of the data, the type of anomalies, and operational constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do mammals need to sleep? Neuroscience treats sleep and wake as default and perturbation modes of the brain. It is hypothesized that the brain self-organizes neural activities without environmental inputs. This paper presents a new computational model of the sleep-wake cycle (SWC) for learning and memory. During the sleep mode, the memory consolidation by the thalamocortical system is abstracted by a disentangling operator that maps context-dependent representations (CDR) to context-independent representations (CIR) for generalization. Such a disentangling operator can be mathematically formalized by an integral transform that integrates the context variable from CDR. During the wake mode, the memory formation by the hippocampal-neocortical system is abstracted by an entangling operator from CIR to CDR where the context is introduced by physical motion. When designed as inductive bias, entangled CDR linearizes the problem of unsupervised learning for sensory memory by direct-fit. The concatenation of disentangling and entangling operators forms a disentangling-entangling cycle (DEC) as the building block for sensorimotor learning. We also discuss the relationship of DEC and SWC to the perception-action cycle (PAC) for internal model learning and perceptual control theory for the ecological origin of natural languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre R Kuroswiski, Annie S Wu, Angelo Passaro</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach to enhancing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) through the integration of domain knowledge and attention-based policy mechanisms. Our methodology focuses on the incorporation of domain-specific expertise into the learning process, which simplifies the development of collaborative behaviors. This approach aims to reduce the complexity and learning overhead typically associated with MARL by enabling agents to concentrate on essential aspects of complex tasks, thus optimizing the learning curve. The utilization of attention mechanisms plays a key role in our model. It allows for the effective processing of dynamic context data and nuanced agent interactions, leading to more refined decision-making. Applied in standard MARL scenarios, such as the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL) Pursuit and Multi-Particle Environments (MPE) Simple Spread, our method has been shown to improve both learning efficiency and the effectiveness of collaborative behaviors. The results indicate that our attention-based approach can be a viable approach for improving the efficiency of MARL training process, integrating domain-specific knowledge at the action level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viny Saajan Victor, Andre Schmei{\ss}er, Heike Leitte, Simone Gramsch</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last ten years, the average annual growth rate of nonwoven production was 4%. In 2020 and 2021, nonwoven production has increased even further due to the huge demand for nonwoven products needed for protective clothing such as FFP2 masks to combat the COVID19 pandemic. Optimizing the production process is still a challenge due to its high nonlinearity. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based optimization workflow aimed at improving the homogeneity of spunbond nonwovens. The optimization workflow is based on a mathematical model that simulates the microstructures of nonwovens. Based on trainingy data coming from this simulator, different machine learning algorithms are trained in order to find a surrogate model for the time-consuming simulator. Human validation is employed to verify the outputs of machine learning algorithms by assessing the aesthetics of the nonwovens. We include scientific and expert knowledge into the training data to reduce the computational costs involved in the optimization process. We demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our workflow in optimizing the homogeneity of nonwovens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Melton, Shannon Reid, Gabriel Terejanu, Siddharth Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users. In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Our experiments demonstrate that enriching text-based embeddings of users with network information from the user interaction graph using our semi-supervised GNN method outperforms both classifiers trained on user textual embeddings and zero-shot classification using LLMs such as GPT4. We discuss the need for integrating nuanced understanding from social science with the scalability of computational methods to better understand how polarization on social media occurs for divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayin Chen, Xiaodan Shi, Haoran Zhang, Xuan Song, Dongxiao Zhang, Yuntian Chen, Jinyue Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings significantly relies on monitoring indoor ambient temperature. The potential limitations of conventional temperature measurement techniques, together with the omnipresence of smartphones, have redirected researchers'attention towards the exploration of phone-based ambient temperature estimation methods. However, existing phone-based methods face challenges such as insufficient privacy protection, difficulty in adapting models to various phones, and hurdles in obtaining enough labeled training data. In this study, we propose a distributed phone-based ambient temperature estimation system which enables collaboration among multiple phones to accurately measure the ambient temperature in different areas of an indoor space. This system also provides an efficient, cost-effective approach with a few-shot meta-learning module and an automated label generation module. It shows that with just 5 new training data points, the temperature estimation model can adapt to a new phone and reach a good performance. Moreover, the system uses crowdsourcing to generate accurate labels for all newly collected training data, significantly reducing costs. Additionally, we highlight the potential of incorporating federated learning into our system to enhance privacy protection. We believe this study can advance the practical application of phone-based ambient temperature measurement, facilitating energy-saving efforts in buildings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aobo Liang, Xingguo Jiang, Yan Sun, Xiaohou Shi, Ke Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) provides longer insights into future trends and patterns. Over the past few years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, LTSF faces inherent challenges such as long-term dependencies capturing and sparse semantic characteristics. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements. Additionally, multivariate time series data in different scenarios may exhibit varying emphasis on intra- or inter-series dependencies. Therefore, we propose a series-relation-aware decider that controls the utilization of channel-independent or channel-mixing tokenization strategy for specific datasets. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao-Rong Lai, Weiwen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) is an arising approach to generalize invariant features to different environments in machine learning. While most related works focus on new IRM settings or new application scenarios, the mathematical essence of IRM remains to be properly explained. We verify that IRM is essentially a total variation based on $L^2$ norm (TV-$\ell_2$) of the learning risk with respect to the classifier variable. Moreover, we propose a novel IRM framework based on the TV-$\ell_1$ model. It not only expands the classes of functions that can be used as the learning risk and the feature extractor, but also has robust performance in denoising and invariant feature preservation based on the coarea formula. We also illustrate some requirements for IRM-TV-$\ell_1$ to achieve out-of-distribution generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves competitive performance in several benchmark machine learning scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sander Dalm, Joshua Offergeld, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: The backpropagation algorithm remains the dominant and most successful method for training deep neural networks (DNNs). At the same time, training DNNs at scale comes at a significant computational cost and therefore a high carbon footprint. Converging evidence suggests that input decorrelation may speed up deep learning. However, to date, this has not yet translated into substantial improvements in training efficiency in large-scale DNNs. This is mainly caused by the challenge of enforcing fast and stable network-wide decorrelation. Here, we show for the first time that much more efficient training of very deep neural networks using decorrelated backpropagation is feasible. To achieve this goal we made use of a novel algorithm which induces network-wide input decorrelation using minimal computational overhead. By combining this algorithm with careful optimizations, we obtain a more than two-fold speed-up and higher test accuracy compared to backpropagation when training a 18-layer deep residual network. This demonstrates that decorrelation provides exciting prospects for efficient deep learning at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilin Chen, Ruichu Cai, Zeqin Yang, Jie Qiao, Yuguang Yan, Zijian Li, Zhifeng Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal effect estimation under networked interference is an important but challenging problem. Available parametric methods are limited in their model space, while previous semiparametric methods, e.g., leveraging neural networks to fit only one single nuisance function, may still encounter misspecification problems under networked interference without appropriate assumptions on the data generation process. To mitigate bias stemming from misspecification, we propose a novel doubly robust causal effect estimator under networked interference, by adapting the targeted learning technique to the training of neural networks. Specifically, we generalize the targeted learning technique into the networked interference setting and establish the condition under which an estimator achieves double robustness. Based on the condition, we devise an end-to-end causal effect estimator by transforming the identified theoretical condition into a targeted loss. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of our designed estimator, revealing a faster convergence rate compared to a single nuisance model. Extensive experimental results on two real-world networks with semisynthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongrong Ma, Guansong Pang, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: One main challenge in imbalanced graph classification is to learn expressive representations of the graphs in under-represented (minority) classes. Existing generic imbalanced learning methods, such as oversampling and imbalanced learning loss functions, can be adopted for enabling graph representation learning models to cope with this challenge. However, these methods often directly operate on the graph representations, ignoring rich discriminative information within the graphs and their interactions. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel multi-scale oversampling graph neural network (MOSGNN) that learns expressive minority graph representations based on intra- and inter-graph semantics resulting from oversampled graphs at multiple scales - subgraph, graph, and pairwise graphs. It achieves this by jointly optimizing subgraph-level, graph-level, and pairwise-graph learning tasks to learn the discriminative information embedded within and between the minority graphs. Extensive experiments on 16 imbalanced graph datasets show that MOSGNN i) significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art models, and ii) offers a generic framework, in which different advanced imbalanced learning loss functions can be easily plugged in and obtain significantly improved classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcella Astrid, Muhammad Zaigham Zaheer, Djamila Aouada, Seung-Ik Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the rare occurrence of anomalous events, a typical approach to anomaly detection is to train an autoencoder (AE) with normal data only so that it learns the patterns or representations of the normal training data. At test time, the trained AE is expected to well reconstruct normal but to poorly reconstruct anomalous data. However, contrary to the expectation, anomalous data is often well reconstructed as well. In order to further separate the reconstruction quality between normal and anomalous data, we propose creating pseudo anomalies from learned adaptive noise by exploiting the aforementioned weakness of AE, i.e., reconstructing anomalies too well. The generated noise is added to the normal data to create pseudo anomalies. Extensive experiments on Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, CIFAR-10, and KDDCUP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generic applicability of our approach in improving the discriminative capability of AEs for anomaly detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Hyper-Trees and offers a new direction in applying tree-based models to time series data. Unlike conventional applications of decision trees that forecast time series directly, Hyper-Trees are designed to learn the parameters of a target time series model. Our framework leverages the gradient-based nature of boosted trees, which allows us to extend the concept of Hyper-Networks to Hyper-Trees and to induce a time-series inductive bias to tree models. By relating the parameters of a target time series model to features, Hyper-Trees address the issue of parameter non-stationarity and enable tree-based forecasts to extend beyond their training range. With our research, we aim to explore the effectiveness of Hyper-Trees across various forecasting scenarios and to extend the application of gradient boosted decision trees outside their conventional use in time series modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Makelov, George Lange, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangling model activations into meaningful features is a central problem in interpretability. However, the lack of ground-truth for these features in realistic scenarios makes the validation of recent approaches, such as sparse dictionary learning, elusive. To overcome this, we propose a framework to evaluate feature dictionaries in the context of specific tasks, by comparing them against \emph{supervised} feature dictionaries. First, we demonstrate that supervised dictionaries achieve excellent approximation, control and interpretability of model computations on the task. Second, we use the supervised dictionaries to develop and contextualize evaluations of unsupervised dictionaries along the same three axes.
  We apply this framework to the indirect object identification task (IOI) using GPT-2 Small, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on either the IOI or OpenWebText datasets. We find that these SAEs capture interpretable features for the IOI task, but they are not as successful as supervised features in controlling the model. Finally, we observe two qualitative phenomena in SAE training: feature occlusion (where a causally relevant concept is robustly overshadowed by even slightly higher-magnitude ones in the learned features), and feature over-splitting (where binary features split into many smaller features without clear interpretation). We hope that our framework will be a useful step towards more objective and grounded evaluations of sparse dictionary learning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel feature weighting method to address the limitation of existing feature processing methods for tabular data. Typically the existing methods assume equal importance across all samples and features in one dataset. This simplified processing methods overlook the unique contributions of each feature, and thus may miss important feature information. As a result, it leads to suboptimal performance in complex datasets with rich features. To address this problem, we introduce Tabular Feature Weighting with Transformer, a novel feature weighting approach for tabular data. Our method adopts Transformer to capture complex feature dependencies and contextually assign appropriate weights to discrete and continuous features. Besides, we employ a reinforcement learning strategy to further fine-tune the weighting process. Our extensive experimental results across various real-world datasets and diverse downstream tasks show the effectiveness of TFWT and highlight the potential for enhancing feature weighting in tabular data analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study active learning methods for single index models of the form $F({\mathbf x}) = f(\langle {\mathbf w}, {\mathbf x}\rangle)$, where $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and ${\mathbf x,\mathbf w} \in \mathbb{R}^d$. In addition to their theoretical interest as simple examples of non-linear neural networks, single index models have received significant recent attention due to applications in scientific machine learning like surrogate modeling for partial differential equations (PDEs). Such applications require sample-efficient active learning methods that are robust to adversarial noise. I.e., that work even in the challenging agnostic learning setting.
  We provide two main results on agnostic active learning of single index models. First, when $f$ is known and Lipschitz, we show that $\tilde{O}(d)$ samples collected via {statistical leverage score sampling} are sufficient to learn a near-optimal single index model. Leverage score sampling is simple to implement, efficient, and already widely used for actively learning linear models. Our result requires no assumptions on the data distribution, is optimal up to log factors, and improves quadratically on a recent ${O}(d^{2})$ bound of \cite{gajjar2023active}. Second, we show that $\tilde{O}(d)$ samples suffice even in the more difficult setting when $f$ is \emph{unknown}. Our results leverage tools from high dimensional probability, including Dudley's inequality and dual Sudakov minoration, as well as a novel, distribution-aware discretization of the class of Lipschitz functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaitian Wang, Pengfei Wang, Kunpeng Liu, Pengyang Wang, Yanjie Fu, Chang-Tien Lu, Charu C. Aggarwal, Jian Pei, Yuanchun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data, and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, we propose a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities. Specifically, from a data-centric perspective, this survey proposes a modality-independent taxonomy by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between data samples, including single-wise, pair-wise, and population-wise sample data augmentation methods. Additionally, we categorize data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Ben-Itzhak, Helen M\"ollering, Benny Pinkas, Thomas Schneider, Ajith Suresh, Oleksandr Tkachenko, Shay Vargaftik, Christian Weinert, Hossein Yalame, Avishay Yanai</p>
<p>Abstract: Secure aggregation is commonly used in federated learning (FL) to alleviate privacy concerns related to the central aggregator seeing all parameter updates in the clear. Unfortunately, most existing secure aggregation schemes ignore two critical orthogonal research directions that aim to (i) significantly reduce client-server communication and (ii) mitigate the impact of malicious clients. However, both of these additional properties are essential to facilitate cross-device FL with thousands or even millions of (mobile) participants.
  In this paper, we unite both research directions by introducing ScionFL, the first secure aggregation framework for FL that operates efficiently on quantized inputs and simultaneously provides robustness against malicious clients. Our framework leverages (novel) multi-party computation (MPC) techniques and supports multiple linear (1-bit) quantization schemes, including ones that utilize the randomized Hadamard transform and Kashin's representation.
  Our theoretical results are supported by extensive evaluations. We show that with no overhead for clients and moderate overhead for the server compared to transferring and processing quantized updates in plaintext, we obtain comparable accuracy for standard FL benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Diller, Thomas Funkhouser, Angela Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a generative approach to forecast long-term future human behavior in 3D, requiring only weak supervision from readily available 2D human action data. This is a fundamental task enabling many downstream applications. The required ground-truth data is hard to capture in 3D (mocap suits, expensive setups) but easy to acquire in 2D (simple RGB cameras). Thus, we design our method to only require 2D RGB data at inference time while being able to generate 3D human motion sequences. We use a differentiable 2D projection scheme in an autoregressive manner for weak supervision, and an adversarial loss for 3D regularization. Our method predicts long and complex human behavior sequences (e.g., cooking, assembly) consisting of multiple sub-actions. We tackle this in a semantically hierarchical manner, jointly predicting high-level coarse action labels together with their low-level fine-grained realizations as characteristic 3D human poses. We observe that these two action representations are coupled in nature, and joint prediction benefits both action and pose forecasting. Our experiments demonstrate the complementary nature of joint action and 3D pose prediction: our joint approach outperforms each task treated individually, enables robust longer-term sequence prediction, and improves over alternative approaches to forecast actions and characteristic 3D poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Diaz, Mario Geiger, Richard Iain McKinley</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) allow for parameter sharing and translational equivariance by using convolutional kernels in their linear layers. By restricting these kernels to be SO(3)-steerable, CNNs can further improve parameter sharing. These rotationally-equivariant convolutional layers have several advantages over standard convolutional layers, including increased robustness to unseen poses, smaller network size, and improved sample efficiency. Despite this, most segmentation networks used in medical image analysis continue to rely on standard convolutional kernels. In this paper, we present a new family of segmentation networks that use equivariant voxel convolutions based on spherical harmonics. These networks are robust to data poses not seen during training, and do not require rotation-based data augmentation during training. In addition, we demonstrate improved segmentation performance in MRI brain tumor and healthy brain structure segmentation tasks, with enhanced robustness to reduced amounts of training data and improved parameter efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungchul Hong, Jong-June Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: The optimal allocation of assets has been widely discussed with the theoretical analysis of risk measures, and pessimism is one of the most attractive approaches beyond the conventional optimal portfolio model. The $\alpha$-risk plays a crucial role in deriving a broad class of pessimistic optimal portfolios. However, estimating an optimal portfolio assessed by a pessimistic risk is still challenging due to the absence of a computationally tractable model. In this study, we propose an integral of $\alpha$-risk called the \textit{uniform pessimistic risk} and the computational algorithm to obtain an optimal portfolio based on the risk. Further, we investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed risk in view of three different approaches: multiple quantile regression, the proper scoring rule, and distributionally robust optimization. Real data analysis of three stock datasets (S\&P500, CSI500, KOSPI200) demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed risk and portfolio model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Duk Park, Cong Tran, Won-Yong Shin, Xin Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Bombari, Marco Mondelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are known to overfit and memorize spurious features in the training dataset. While numerous empirical studies have aimed at understanding this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify it is still missing. In this paper, we consider spurious features that are uncorrelated with the learning task, and we provide a precise characterization of how they are memorized via two separate terms: (i) the stability of the model with respect to individual training samples, and (ii) the feature alignment between the spurious feature and the full sample. While the first term is well established in learning theory and it is connected to the generalization error in classical work, the second one is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. Our key technical result gives a precise characterization of the feature alignment for the two prototypical settings of random features (RF) and neural tangent kernel (NTK) regression. We prove that the memorization of spurious features weakens as the generalization capability increases and, through the analysis of the feature alignment, we unveil the role of the model and of its activation function. Numerical experiments show the predictive power of our theory on standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Qin, Wei Yang, Binghao Huang, Karl Van Wyk, Hao Su, Xiaolong Wang, Yu-Wei Chao, Dieter Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based teleoperation offers the possibility to endow robots with human-level intelligence to physically interact with the environment, while only requiring low-cost camera sensors. However, current vision-based teleoperation systems are designed and engineered towards a particular robot model and deploy environment, which scales poorly as the pool of the robot models expands and the variety of the operating environment increases. In this paper, we propose AnyTeleop, a unified and general teleoperation system to support multiple different arms, hands, realities, and camera configurations within a single system. Although being designed to provide great flexibility to the choice of simulators and real hardware, our system can still achieve great performance. For real-world experiments, AnyTeleop can outperform a previous system that was designed for a specific robot hardware with a higher success rate, using the same robot. For teleoperation in simulation, AnyTeleop leads to better imitation learning performance, compared with a previous system that is particularly designed for that simulator.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Bastianello, Diego Deplano, Mauro Franceschelli, Karl H. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent deployment of multi-agent networks has enabled the distributed solution of learning problems, where agents cooperate to train a global model without sharing their local, private data. This work specifically targets some prevalent challenges inherent to distributed learning: (i) online training, i.e., the local data change over time; (ii) asynchronous agent computations; (iii) unreliable and limited communications; and (iv) inexact local computations. To tackle these challenges, we apply the Distributed Operator Theoretical (DOT) version of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which we call "DOT-ADMM". We prove that if the DOT-ADMM operator is metric subregular, then it converges with a linear rate for a large class of (not necessarily strongly) convex learning problems toward a bounded neighborhood of the optimal time-varying solution, and characterize how such neighborhood depends on (i)-(iv). We first derive an easy-to-verify condition for ensuring the metric subregularity of an operator, followed by tutorial examples on linear and logistic regression problems. We corroborate the theoretical analysis with numerical simulations comparing DOT-ADMM with other state-of-the-art algorithms, showing that only the proposed algorithm exhibits robustness to (i)-(iv).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhua Cheng, Weiwei Zhang, Haihao Shen, Yiyang Cai, Xin He, Kaokao Lv, Yi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language-related tasks. However, their deployment presents significant challenges due to their substantial memory and storage requirements. To address this challenge, weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution. Previous research has indicated that fine-tuning through up and down rounding can enhance performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that utilizes signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping within just 200 steps, combining the strengths of both Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). SignRound achieves outstanding results compared to recent methods across 2 to 4 bits, while maintaining low tuning costs and without introducing any additional inference overhead. For instance, SignRound led to absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91\% to 33.22\% at 2 bits. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust generalization to various recent models and achieves near-lossless quantization in most scenarios at 4 bits.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Thomas, Seth Spielman, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.
  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality "gold" labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangjun Ruan, Honghua Dong, Andrew Wang, Silviu Pitis, Yongchao Zhou, Jimmy Ba, Yann Dubois, Chris J. Maddison, Tatsunori Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks - such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, setting up the environment for each test scenario manually, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tailed risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables the testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios, without manual instantiation. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes tools and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuyuan Cheng, Jianfeng Lu, Yixin Tan, Yao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow-based generative models enjoy certain advantages in computing the data generation and the likelihood, and have recently shown competitive empirical performance. Compared to the accumulating theoretical studies on related score-based diffusion models, analysis of flow-based models, which are deterministic in both forward (data-to-noise) and reverse (noise-to-data) directions, remain sparse. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of generating data distribution by a progressive flow model, the so-called JKO flow model, which implements the Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme in a normalizing flow network. Leveraging the exponential convergence of the proximal gradient descent (GD) in Wasserstein space, we prove the Kullback-Leibler (KL) guarantee of data generation by a JKO flow model to be $O(\varepsilon^2)$ when using $N \lesssim \log (1/\varepsilon)$ many JKO steps ($N$ Residual Blocks in the flow) where $\varepsilon $ is the error in the per-step first-order condition. The assumption on data density is merely a finite second moment, and the theory extends to data distributions without density and when there are inversion errors in the reverse process where we obtain KL-$W_2$ mixed error guarantees. The non-asymptotic convergence rate of the JKO-type $W_2$-proximal GD is proved for a general class of convex objective functionals that includes the KL divergence as a special case, which can be of independent interest. The analysis framework can extend to other first-order Wasserstein optimization schemes applied to flow-based generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biyonka Liang, Iavor Bojinov</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-armed bandit (MAB) experiments, it is often advantageous to continuously produce inference on the average treatment effect (ATE) between arms as new data arrive and determine a data-driven stopping time for the experiment. We develop the Mixture Adaptive Design (MAD), a new experimental design for multi-armed bandit experiments that produces powerful and anytime-valid inference on the ATE for \emph{any} bandit algorithm of the experimenter's choice, even those without probabilistic treatment assignment. Intuitively, the MAD "mixes" any bandit algorithm of the experimenter's choice with a Bernoulli design through a tuning parameter $\delta_t$, where $\delta_t$ is a deterministic sequence that decreases the priority placed on the Bernoulli design as the sample size grows. We prove that for $\delta_t = \omega\left(t^{-1/4}\right)$, the MAD generates anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences that are guaranteed to shrink around the true ATE. Hence, the experimenter is guaranteed to detect a true non-zero treatment effect in finite time. Additionally, we prove that the regret of the MAD approaches that of its underlying bandit algorithm over time, and hence, incurs a relatively small loss in regret in return for powerful inferential guarantees. Finally, we conduct an extensive simulation study exhibiting that the MAD achieves finite-sample anytime validity and high power without significant losses in finite-sample reward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Wang, Clayton Scott</p>
<p>Abstract: The notion of margin loss has been central to the development and analysis of algorithms for binary classification. To date, however, there remains no consensus as to the analogue of the margin loss for multiclass classification. In this work, we show that a broad range of multiclass loss functions, including many popular ones, can be expressed in the relative margin form, a generalization of the margin form of binary losses. The relative margin form is broadly useful for understanding and analyzing multiclass losses as shown by our prior work (Wang and Scott, 2020, 2021). To further demonstrate the utility of this way of expressing multiclass losses, we use it to extend the seminal result of Bartlett et al. (2006) on classification-calibration of binary margin losses to multiclass. We then analyze the class of Fenchel-Young losses, and expand the set of these losses that are known to be classification-calibrated.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private projection-depth-based medians using the propose-test-release (PTR) and exponential mechanisms. Under general conditions on the input parameters and the population measure, (e.g. we do not assume any moment bounds), we quantify the probability the test in PTR fails, as well as the cost of privacy via finite sample deviation bounds. We then present a new definition of the finite sample breakdown point which applies to a mechanism, and present a lower bound on the finite sample breakdown point of the projection-depth-based median. We demonstrate our main results on the canonical projection-depth-based median, as well as on projection-depth-based medians derived from trimmed estimators. In the Gaussian setting, we show that the resulting deviation bound matches the known lower bound for private Gaussian mean estimation. In the Cauchy setting, we show that the "outlier error amplification" effect resulting from the heavy tails outweighs the cost of privacy. This result is then verified via numerical simulations. Additionally, we present results on general PTR mechanisms and a uniform concentration result on the projected spacings of order statistics, which may be of general interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Ohmichi</p>
<p>Abstract: The conventional modal analysis techniques face difficulties in handling nonstationary phenomena, such as transient, nonperiodic, or intermittent phenomena. This paper presents a variational mode decomposition--based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS) analysis that enables the extraction and analysis of coherent structures in the case of nonstationary phenomena from high-dimensional spatiotemporal data. The VMD-NCS analysis decomposes the input spatiotemporal data into intrinsic coherent structures (ICSs) that represent nonstationary spatiotemporal patterns and exhibit coherence in both spatial and temporal directions. Unlike many conventional modal analysis techniques, the proposed method accounts for the temporal changes in the spatial distribution with time. Tthe VMD-NCS analysis was validated based on the transient growth phenomena in the flow around a cylinder. It was confirmed that the temporal changes in the spatial distribution, depicting the transient growth of vortex shedding where fluctuations arising in the far-wake region gradually approach the near-wake region, were represented as a single ICS. Furthermore, in the analysis of the quasi-periodic flow field around a pitching airfoil, the temporal changes in the spatial distribution and the amplitude of vortex shedding behind the airfoil, influenced by the pitching motion of the airfoil, were captured as a single ICS. The impact of two parameters that control the number of ICSs ($K$) and the penalty factor related to the temporal coherence ($\alpha$), was investigated. The results revealed that $K$ has a significant impact on the VMD-NCS analysis results. In the case of a relatively high $K$, the VMD-NCS analysis tends to extract more periodic spatiotemporal patterns resembling the results of dynamic mode decomposition. In the case of a small $K$, it tends to extract more nonstationary spatiotemporal patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Madsen, Sarath Chandar, Siva Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunwoong Yang, Hojin Kim, Yoonpyo Hong, Kwanjung Yee, Romit Maulik, Namwoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their progress has yet to be equal across languages. While most LLMs are trained in high-resource languages like English, multilingual models generally underperform monolingual ones. Additionally, aspects of their multilingual foundation sometimes restrict the byproducts they produce, like computational demands and licensing regimes. In this study, we document the development of open-foundation models tailored for use in low-resource settings, their limitations, and their benefits.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tairan He, Chong Zhang, Wenli Xiao, Guanqi He, Changliu Liu, Guanya Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Legged robots navigating cluttered environments must be jointly agile for efficient task execution and safe to avoid collisions with obstacles or humans. Existing studies either develop conservative controllers (< 1.0 m/s) to ensure safety, or focus on agility without considering potentially fatal collisions. This paper introduces Agile But Safe (ABS), a learning-based control framework that enables agile and collision-free locomotion for quadrupedal robots. ABS involves an agile policy to execute agile motor skills amidst obstacles and a recovery policy to prevent failures, collaboratively achieving high-speed and collision-free navigation. The policy switch in ABS is governed by a learned control-theoretic reach-avoid value network, which also guides the recovery policy as an objective function, thereby safeguarding the robot in a closed loop. The training process involves the learning of the agile policy, the reach-avoid value network, the recovery policy, and an exteroception representation network, all in simulation. These trained modules can be directly deployed in the real world with onboard sensing and computation, leading to high-speed and collision-free navigation in confined indoor and outdoor spaces with both static and dynamic obstacles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Bombari, Marco Mondelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the reasons behind the exceptional success of transformers requires a better analysis of why attention layers are suitable for NLP tasks. In particular, such tasks require predictive models to capture contextual meaning which often depends on one or few words, even if the sentence is long. Our work studies this key property, dubbed word sensitivity (WS), in the prototypical setting of random features. We show that attention layers enjoy high WS, namely, there exists a vector in the space of embeddings that largely perturbs the random attention features map. The argument critically exploits the role of the softmax in the attention layer, highlighting its benefit compared to other activations (e.g., ReLU). In contrast, the WS of standard random features is of order $1/\sqrt{n}$, $n$ being the number of words in the textual sample, and thus it decays with the length of the context. We then translate these results on the word sensitivity into generalization bounds: due to their low WS, random features provably cannot learn to distinguish between two sentences that differ only in a single word; in contrast, due to their high WS, random attention features have higher generalization capabilities. We validate our theoretical results with experimental evidence over the BERT-Base word embeddings of the imdb review dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose Stability- and certificate-oriented EDMD (SafEDMD): a novel EDMD-based learning architecture which comes along with rigorous certificates, resulting in a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion. To ensure the trustworthiness of SafEDMD, we derive proportional error bounds, which vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks, leading to certified controller design based on semi-definite programming. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although biomedical entity linking (BioEL) has made significant progress with pre-trained language models, challenges still exist for fine-grained and long-tailed entities. To address these challenges, we present BioELQA, a novel model that treats Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice Question Answering. BioELQA first obtains candidate entities with a fast retriever, jointly presents the mention and candidate entities to a generator, and then outputs the predicted symbol associated with its chosen entity. This formulation enables explicit comparison of different candidate entities, thus capturing fine-grained interactions between mentions and entities, as well as among entities themselves. To improve generalization for long-tailed entities, we retrieve similar labeled training instances as clues and concatenate the input with retrieved instances for the generator. Extensive experimental results show that BioELQA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on several datasets.</p>

Moreover, we present a way to share common information across scenes, hence allowing for a reduction of model complexity to learn a particular scene.

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. Thielen, J. Sosulski, M. Tangermann</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores two zero-training methods aimed at enhancing the usability of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by eliminating the need for a calibration session. We introduce a novel method rooted in the event-related potential (ERP) domain, unsupervised mean maximization (UMM), to the fast code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP) stimulus protocol. We compare UMM to the state-of-the-art c-VEP zero-training method that uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The comparison includes instantaneous classification and classification with cumulative learning from previously classified trials for both CCA and UMM. Our study shows the effectiveness of both methods in navigating the complexities of a c-VEP dataset, highlighting their differences and distinct strengths. This research not only provides insights into the practical implementation of calibration-free BCI methods but also paves the way for further exploration and refinement. Ultimately, the fusion of CCA and UMM holds promise for enhancing the accessibility and usability of BCI systems across various application domains and a multitude of stimulus protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H. A. Scheppink, S. Ahmadi, P. Desain, M. Tangermann, J. Thielen</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude-modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepehr Dehdashtian, Lan Wang, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP provide compact and general-purpose representations of text and images that are demonstrably effective across multiple downstream zero-shot prediction tasks. However, owing to the nature of their training process, these models have the potential to 1) propagate or amplify societal biases in the training data and 2) learn to rely on spurious features. This paper proposes FairerCLIP, a general approach for making zero-shot predictions of CLIP more fair and robust to spurious correlations. We formulate the problem of jointly debiasing CLIP's image and text representations in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), which affords multiple benefits: 1) Flexibility: Unlike existing approaches, which are specialized to either learn with or without ground-truth labels, FairerCLIP is adaptable to learning in both scenarios. 2) Ease of Optimization: FairerCLIP lends itself to an iterative optimization involving closed-form solvers, which leads to $4\times$-$10\times$ faster training than the existing methods. 3) Sample Efficiency: Under sample-limited conditions, FairerCLIP significantly outperforms baselines when they fail entirely. And, 4) Performance: Empirically, FairerCLIP achieves appreciable accuracy gains on benchmark fairness and spurious correlation datasets over their respective baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Tan, Shuyuan Xu, Wenyue Hua, Yingqiang Ge, Zelong Li, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the traditional ranking-based recommendation style into a text-to-text generation paradigm. However, in contrast to standard NLP tasks that inherently operate on human vocabulary, current research in generative recommendations struggles to effectively encode recommendation items within the text-to-text framework using concise yet meaningful ID representations. To better align LLMs with recommendation needs, we propose IDGen, representing each item as a unique, concise, semantically rich, platform-agnostic textual ID using human language tokens. This is achieved by training a textual ID generator alongside the LLM-based recommender, enabling seamless integration of personalized recommendations into natural language generation. Notably, as user history is expressed in natural language and decoupled from the original dataset, our approach suggests the potential for a foundational generative recommendation model. Experiments show that our framework consistently surpasses existing models in sequential recommendation under standard experimental setting. Then, we explore the possibility of training a foundation recommendation model with the proposed method on data collected from 19 different datasets and tested its recommendation performance on 6 unseen datasets across different platforms under a completely zero-shot setting. The results show that the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained foundation model is comparable to or even better than some traditional recommendation models based on supervised training, showing the potential of the IDGen paradigm serving as the foundation model for generative recommendation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Narayanan, S. Ahmadi, P. Desain, J. Thielen</p>
<p>Abstract: A limitation of brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers is that they require the user to be able to move the eyes to fixate on targets. This poses an issue for users who cannot voluntarily control their eye movements, for instance, people living with late-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This pilot study makes the first step towards a gaze-independent speller based on the code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP). Participants were presented with two bi-laterally located stimuli, one of which was flashing, and were tasked to attend to one of these stimuli either by directly looking at the stimuli (overt condition) or by using spatial attention, eliminating the need for eye movement (covert condition). The attended stimuli were decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) and classification accuracies of 88% and 100% were obtained for the covert and overt conditions, respectively. These fundamental insights show the promising feasibility of utilizing the c-VEP protocol for gaze-independent BCIs that use covert spatial attention when both stimuli flash simultaneously.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the design of artificial reverberation algorithms aimed at emulating the room acoustics of physical environments. Despite significant advancements, automatic parameter tuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novel method for finding the parameters of a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) such that its output renders target attributes of a measured room impulse response. The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable FDN with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a perceptually-motivated time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent FDNs capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics, and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical FDN design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joachim Winther Pedersen, Erwan Plantec, Eleni Nisioti, Milton Montero, Sebastian Risi</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks used for reinforcement learning are structurally rigid, meaning that each optimized parameter of the network is tied to its specific placement in the network structure. It also means that a network only works with pre-defined and fixed input- and output sizes. This is a consequence of having the number of optimized parameters being directly dependent on the structure of the network. Structural rigidity limits the ability to optimize parameters of policies across multiple environments that do not share input and output spaces. Here, we evolve a set of neurons and plastic synapses each represented by a gated recurrent unit (GRU). During optimization, the parameters of these fundamental units of a neural network are optimized in different random structural configurations. Earlier work has shown that parameter sharing between units is important for making structurally flexible neurons We show that it is possible to optimize a set of distinct neuron- and synapse types allowing for a mitigation of the symmetry dilemma. We demonstrate this by optimizing a single set of neurons and synapses to solve multiple reinforcement learning control tasks simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Abi-Karam, Rishov Sarkar, Allison Seigler, Sean Lowe, Zhigang Wei, Hanqiu Chen, Nanditha Rao, Lizy John, Aman Arora, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to high-level synthesis (HLS) flows for quality-of-result (QoR) prediction and design space exploration (DSE). Nevertheless, the scarcity of accessible high-quality HLS datasets and the complexity of building such datasets present challenges. Existing datasets have limitations in terms of benchmark coverage, design space enumeration, vendor extensibility, or lack of reproducible and extensible software for dataset construction. Many works also lack user-friendly ways to add more designs, limiting wider adoption of such datasets.
  In response to these challenges, we introduce HLSFactory, a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the curation and generation of high-quality HLS design datasets. HLSFactory has three main stages: 1) a design space expansion stage to elaborate single HLS designs into large design spaces using various optimization directives across multiple vendor tools, 2) a design synthesis stage to execute HLS and FPGA tool flows concurrently across designs, and 3) a data aggregation stage for extracting standardized data into packaged datasets for ML usage. This tripartite architecture ensures broad design space coverage via design space expansion and supports multiple vendor tools. Users can contribute to each stage with their own HLS designs and synthesis results and extend the framework itself with custom frontends and tool flows. We also include an initial set of built-in designs from common HLS benchmarks curated open-source HLS designs.
  We showcase the versatility and multi-functionality of our framework through six case studies: I) Design space sampling; II) Fine-grained parallelism backend speedup; III) Targeting Intel's HLS flow; IV) Adding new auxiliary designs; V) Integrating published HLS data; VI) HLS tool version regression benchmarking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Adelman, Cagla Keceli, Alba V. Olivares-Nadal</p>
<p>Abstract: We model a Markov decision process, parametrized by an unknown parameter, and study the asymptotic behavior of a sampling-based algorithm, called Thompson sampling. The standard definition of regret is not always suitable to evaluate a policy, especially when the underlying chain structure is general. We show that the standard (expected) regret can grow (super-)linearly and fails to capture the notion of learning in realistic settings with non-trivial state evolution. By decomposing the standard (expected) regret, we develop a new metric, called the expected residual regret, which forgets the immutable consequences of past actions. Instead, it measures regret against the optimal reward moving forward from the current period. We show that the expected residual regret of the Thompson sampling algorithm is upper bounded by a term which converges exponentially fast to 0. We present conditions under which the posterior sampling error of Thompson sampling converges to 0 almost surely. We then introduce the probabilistic version of the expected residual regret and present conditions under which it converges to 0 almost surely. Thus, we provide a viable concept of learning for sampling algorithms which will serve useful in broader settings than had been considered previously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Fu, Yuan Hong, Xinpeng Ling, Leixia Wang, Xun Ran, Zhiyu Sun, Wendy Hui Wang, Zhili Chen, Yang Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, privacy and security concerns in machine learning have promoted trusted federated learning to the forefront of research. Differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for privacy protection in federated learning due to its rigorous mathematical foundation and provable guarantee. Despite extensive research on algorithms that incorporate differential privacy within federated learning, there remains an evident deficiency in systematic reviews that categorize and synthesize these studies.
  Our work presents a systematic overview of the differentially private federated learning. Existing taxonomies have not adequately considered objects and level of privacy protection provided by various differential privacy models in federated learning. To rectify this gap, we propose a new taxonomy of differentially private federated learning based on definition and guarantee of various differential privacy models and federated scenarios. Our classification allows for a clear delineation of the protected objects across various differential privacy models and their respective neighborhood levels within federated learning environments. Furthermore, we explore the applications of differential privacy in federated learning scenarios. Our work provide valuable insights into privacy-preserving federated learning and suggest practical directions for future research.</p>

Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. We additionally perform song classification based on the generated tracks. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Illya Bakurov, Nathan Haut, Wolfgang Banzhaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) was recently introduced as a regularization procedure for training deep neural networks. It simultaneously minimizes the fitness (or loss) function and the so-called fitness sharpness. The latter serves as a measure of the nonlinear behavior of a solution and does so by finding solutions that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly similar loss values across all fitness cases. In this contribution, we adapt SAM for tree Genetic Programming (TGP) by exploring the semantic neighborhoods of solutions using two simple approaches. By capitalizing upon perturbing input and output of program trees, sharpness can be estimated and used as a second optimization criterion during the evolution. To better understand the impact of this variant of SAM on TGP, we collect numerous indicators of the evolutionary process, including generalization ability, complexity, diversity, and a recently proposed genotype-phenotype mapping to study the amount of redundancy in trees. The experimental results demonstrate that using any of the two proposed SAM adaptations in TGP allows (i) a significant reduction of tree sizes in the population and (ii) a decrease in redundancy of the trees. When assessed on real-world benchmarks, the generalization ability of the elite solutions does not deteriorate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexiang Zhai, Hao Bai, Zipeng Lin, Jiayi Pan, Shengbang Tong, Yifei Zhou, Alane Suhr, Saining Xie, Yann LeCun, Yi Ma, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) fine-tuned on specialized visual instruction-following data have exhibited impressive language reasoning capabilities across various scenarios. However, this fine-tuning paradigm may not be able to efficiently learn optimal decision-making agents in multi-step goal-directed tasks from interactive environments. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then prompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM to efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final text-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an executable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task rewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire VLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling 7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini. Furthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial component for performance improvement, as removing the CoT reasoning results in a significant decrease in the overall performance of our method.</p>
